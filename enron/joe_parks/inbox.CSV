Subject: Possible new lease member

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to 
fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head 
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they 
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and 
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot. 
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking 
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out 
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and 
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I 
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could 
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up 
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two 
spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this 
spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be 
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

"","sitara numbers for ponderosa
 
Ed,
    Below are some comments on the deals I have been working. 
 
 Duke/Centana 
  Money wires will be complete on April 1.  The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1.  I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for Duke Field Services was Greg Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. 
Ponderosa Energy Partners
 I have been helping Rick Hill and Chuck Ward manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant.   I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where  I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over.
 
Pace Energy
I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000.
 
General Land Office.
I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal dealsheet for the natural gas volumes.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"FW: Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Wright, Lee

Subject:	Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage


To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

The order requires that we retain all documents (in paper or electronic form) in existence on February 15.  Documents created after February 15 must be retained if, as the order states, the document contains information relevant to:  (1) any claim or defense that may be asserted in the bankruptcy by Enron or a party-in-interest; (2) the financial condition or otherwise in connection with the reorganization of Enron under the Bankruptcy Code; or (3) any governmental investigation or litigation now underway or commenced prior to the termination of this order concerning (a) Enron or any Enron-related affiliates or individuals, (b) present or former directors or officers of Enron, or (c) any affilitiates, subsidiaries, partnerships or joint ventures or other entities which, to Enron's knowledge, Enron or any Enron-related entity participated.

Please regard the terms of the Order as applying to all Enron companies, not just companies that are a part of the bankruptcy proceeding.  If you are uncertain whether you should retain any particular document, please call Bob Williams at extension 5-2402.  You should err on the side of retaining the document.

This order and email instruction supersede the previous order of the Bankruptcy Court and email to employees dated January 14, 2002.

Thank you.

U.S.C. ?? 105 AND 541 BY AND BETWEEN ENRON CORP.
AND ITS AFFILIATED DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION AND THE
OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF UNSECURED CREDITORS
REGARDING DOCUMENT PRESERVATION AND RETENTION

WHEREAS, Enron Corp. and its affiliated debtors-in-possession in these jointly administered Chapter 11

obligation to preserve all of the assets of their estates;

WHEREAS, Enron's documents, as that term is
defined in Rule 7026-1 of the Local Bankruptcy Rules for
the Southern District of New York, Civil Rule 26.3(c)(2) of
the Local Rules of the United States District Courts for
the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York and Rule
34(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (see
Attachment A hereto) in Enron's possession, custody or
control (hereinafter ""Documents""), constitute assets of
Enron's estates; and

WHEREAS, Enron recognizes that it must preserve
all of its Documents during the pendency of these Chapter
11 cases;

WHEREAS, Enron has represented that it has by
various e-mails, including one dated as recently as January
14, 2002, Enron has restated its Document retention
policies to all of its officers, directors and employees
and explained the need to preserve Enron's Documents in
accordance with then-existing policies;

WHEREAS, Enron has represented that it has placed
under lock-and-key all paper shredding machines located at
its headquarters in Houston, Texas;
WHEREAS, the Court, on consent of Enron and the
Creditors' Committee, issued an order dated January 25,
2002 relating to document preservation (see Attachment B
hereto).

IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED THAT:
1. Enron, and its officers and directors, shall
make reasonable efforts to ensure that none of Enron's
Documents shall be destroyed or wrongfully removed from
Enron's premises in a manner inconsistent with the terms of
the Order.

2. To the extent that Enron's Documents are in
the possession of its agents, accountants or any other
party which maintains documents for, on behalf of or for
the benefit of Enron, Enron shall in writing instruct such
persons to preserve Enron's Documents within ten (10)
business days of the date of this Order, such notice to
include a copy of this Order.

3. All Documents that were in the possession,
custody or control of Enron prior to the date of this
Order, shall be preserved and maintained by Enron and each
of its directors, officers and employees.

4. All Documents that come into the possession,
custody or control of Enron from and after the date of this
Order that contain information (i) relevant to any claim or
defense thereto that may be asserted in these chapter 11
cases by Enron or a party-in-interest, (ii) relevant to the
financial condition or otherwise in connection with the
reorganization of Enron under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code, or (iii) relevant to any governmental investigation
or litigation concerning Enron or any Enron-related
entities or individuals, present or former directors or
officers of Enron, and any affiliates, subsidiaries,
partnerships or joint ventures or other entities in which,
to Enron's knowledge, Enron or any Enron-related entity
participated (collectively, ""Affiliated Entities"") now
underway or commenced prior to the termination of this
Order, shall be preserved and maintained by Enron and each
of its directors, officers and employees, provided,
however, that this Order does not bar the ordinary course
disposal of Documents that come into Enron's possession or
are created by Enron after the date of this Order having no
reasonable or apparent connection to the items listed in
subparts (i), (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph.

5. Nothing contained in this Order shall: (a)
prevent Enron from using any Documents in the ordinary
course of business for any purpose necessary to the
reorganization effort; or (b) entitle any entity to
discovery other than pursuant to applicable law.

6. To the extent the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (""FBI"") discloses to Enron its findings or
conclusions in connection with its investigation of alleged
document destruction on Enron's premises, and to the extent
the FBI permits Enron to disclose such findings or
conclusions, Enron shall report to the Court such findings
or conclusions concerning (a) whether Documents of Enron or
Affiliated Entities have been removed or destroyed since
the commencement of these Chapter 11 cases, and (b) in the
event the FBI investigation discloses that such Documents
were removed or destroyed, (i) the nature of such
documents, (ii) the person(s) responsible for such
destruction or removal, and (iii) measures being taken to
retrieve or restore such documents.

7. Within ten (10) business days after entry of
this Order, Enron's two most senior legal officers, two
most senior accounting officers, and its three other most
senior officers shall submit affidavits stating that such
persons have reviewed this Order, understand its terms, and
will make reasonable efforts to comply with the provisions
of this Order.

8. The terms of this Order shall supercede and
control any prior policy or announcement by Enron
concerning document preservation or destruction to the
extent such policy or announcement is less restrictive than
the terms of this Order.

9. Enron shall immediately post a copy of this
Order on Enron's intranet in such a way as to ensure that
this Order can be reviewed by all of Enron's officers,
directors and employees.

10. This Order shall be effective immediately
and shall remain in effect until modified by further Order
of this Court.

Salsa was uninspired...but had good bite.
Queso is queso when doctored with proper amounts of capsicum, thus pushing the Scoville Units up to an acceptable level.
Mexican Seafood Cocktail...Good effort at the traditional version, albeit the least adventuresome. They make one that has shrimp,crab, octopus, squid, fish, etc. that would have gone over even better with the organ meat eaters. Does not compare to Goode Co.'s version, which is Tex-Mex'ized. Must be why Joe thought it was Ketchup....This version,  which I have eaten in Mexico is nothing more than Ceviche'ized random seafood, Pico, and the Mexican equivalent of V8 juice. Served with lime wedges and saltine crackers, like the natives do it.

Fish and Shrimp Main Course....Thought the fish was exceptionally fresh and tasty. Enjoyed the ""Diablo"" version the best w/ the corn tortillas and Guacamole. Very unique item seldom seen on menus. Would go back just for that. The shrimp suffered from too long in the fryer disease. It needs to be started in the fryer, cooked 1/4 of the way to render the bacon fat away, then finished over a char-grill to give it a smoky flavor. That step seemed to have been left out...fryer the whole time. They probably don't even have a char-grill.

Ritas- ""Rocas"" were good, Frozen was non-descript. Dos XX reliable as always. Perhaps we will get Michaladas next time, as discussed.
Overall...I'd go back, like I said, just for that fish!!!!

Subject: RESULTS OF MAN NIGHT

Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander, 
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how 
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and ""grapes"" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn 
down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for 
being most ""in"" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

The risk of loss in trading commodities can be substantial.  You should
therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in
light of your financial condition.  Information contained in this report is
not to be considered as an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy
commodities, nor do we make guarantees.  Kase will not be responsible for
any typographical errors.  Expressions of opinion are subject to change
without notice.

Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of
which are described below. No representation is being made that any account
will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.  In
fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical
performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any
particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical
performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of
hindsight.

In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no
hypothetical trading  record can completely account for the impact of
financial risk in actual trading.  For example, the abilities to withstand
losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading
losses are material points that can also adversely affect actual trading
results.  There are numerous other factors related to the markets in
general or to the implementation of any specific trading program that
cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical
performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading
results.

"PPEP Payment to TXU/Lone Star and Other","Just to make sure everyone is on the same page with respect to the gas payment obligations of PPEP with respect to its Lone Star Gas service that is administered by ENA on behalf of PPE...

The amounts due TXU/Lone Star that were remitted by PPEP to ENA in 2001 as ""estimated"" invoice payments for gas service provided between April and September (but not remitted by ENA to TXU/Lone Star) are considered as a pre-petition, unsecured claim per my discussions with Chip Schneider.  ENA is not in a position to pay these amounts in bankruptcy.  Accordingly, PPEP will make a direct payment of $558,329.77 to TXU/Lone Star on Monday, February 11.  This should bring the account current and eliminate any further concerns with respect to the flow of gas going forward and the potential for project-level contract defaults.  I've confirmed with Rick Vicens at PPE that this is the course of action we intend to follow and he verbally agreed that, under the circumstances, we are correct in making the payment.  Going forward, all gas-related invoices will be verified/reconciled by ENA and paid directly by PPEP.

PPEP will have a $1.3 MM claim against the Enron estate for these amounts together with the amount remitted to ENA for October 2001 transportation service and revenue due PPEP for gas sales made in November 2001.  Delta Power, which owns through PPE a 90% equity stake in PPEP, has requested information that will allow it to make this claim.  I've asked Joe Henry to consider the request.

The Cleburne, TX facility is currently down on a scheduled maintenance outage that was due to end as early as today.  Due to soft ERCOT power market prices, Brazos has requested that the unit stay down for the remainder of February.  Gas scheduled for the balance of the month will be resold by Joe Parks while Kay Mann evaluates the potential for reducing the gas schedule intra-month.  Additionally, a 0.5 Bcf imbalance exists on the pipeline; indications are that Lone Star will work with us to reduce the imbalance provided the plant is running.  Joe estimates that it will take approximately 2 months to work off the imbalance.  It is my understanding that Kay Mann (or Stacy Dickson) will be looking at the gas contracts to confirm Eric Boyt's conclusions that the Apache/Williams supply contracts do not require scheduling at max daily quantity, which may allow the plant to work off the imbalance more quickly.

I've also asked Rick Vicens to consider a variety of alternatives for managing the gas requirements of the plant going forward.  Absent a change in direction from Delta Power or its lender (KBC Bank), we intend to stay the course in our day-to-day management of the facility.  With respect to gas agency services, Theresa Voss will account for payments that would normally be made to ENA per the agreement in pricipal that we've previously worked under.  I would also ask that each of you spending time on matters pertaining to PPEP keep track of the time spent and out-of-pocket expenses incurred and report the same to me each pay period, as we are entitled under our Corporate Services Agreement (which covers accounting, finance, tax, legal, HR) to bill for services provided at cost plus 5%.

Thanks,

RH

"RE: Williams invoices for Tenaska","Good news on the November payment.  However, we still need to execute the wire for $2,290,500 to prepay April supply costs inasmuch as the issue here relates more to our inability to get an L/C in place prior to the end of this month.  We're working on the L/C matter with JP Morgan, and will have it resolved in April.  In the meantime, we've agreed to make the prepayment prior to Williams accepting April nominations (due yesterday per Joe Parks).

Mike needs to follow through with Williams on the November payment based on our findings.  Any idea who James may have spoke with at Williams?  It would be helpful to Mike to have this information when he calls the credit analyst that brought the issue to his attention.  Also, in response to Margaret's comment below, I think James made the December payment to Williams directly as a result of the Lone Star problem and our own cash management issues.

Thanks,

RH

Please see the attached spreadsheet showing payments for Williams.  We are getting more detail on these payments (ie dates, Fed reference numbers), but you can see that Enron has pretty much paid all the invoices for Tenaska.  Theresa spoke with James on this matter and he said he spoke with Apache and Williams when the snafu with Lone Star was realized, and both said that Tenaska was paid up to date.  This being the situation, we did not prepare a funding request for the prepayment to Williams for April.

Margaret is working on getting the payment info for Apache.  I expect to have it soon.  

Thanks, 
Karen

I have added columns for the actual amount of the supply verification that I have, the amount of the payment that was sent and the date the payment was sent.  I can't see what happened in December either, I can't even find a file for December.

I will go ahead and check the Apache payments now.

Subject:	Williams invoices for Tenaska

Margaret, attached is a spreadsheet that shows 1) the payments Tenaska IV made to ENA.  2) the Williams and Apaches invoice amounts and numbers that should have been paid.  I don't have statement numbers for all the Williams invoices, but I put the contract number on there.  For the payment that Tenaska made to ENA in January, I'm not sure how much went to Williams and how much went to Apache.  The invoices for those vendors for that month total to more than the money that Tenaska sent to Enron.  So whatever you can find out will be helpful.  

If you would look into the Williams stuff first and let us know what you find as quickly as possible, we would appreciate it.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks a bunch!

"Lease Update","Deer All:

Chris and his crew of Tobby and Bobby and Joe and I managed to do some solid 
work on Saturday. In addition to standard spring shut down of stands 
(closing up blinds and pulling motors off barrels) we moved some blinds 
around.All should be impressed with the new stand arrangements in the half 
section.

BONE YARD
The tower blind at Pig stand has been relocated to the boneyard. The stand 
was placed very close to where the ground blind and tripod were originally 
located. It is well hidden and the barrel and feed pen were moved back to 
there original location. Standing at the feeder and looking back at the 
stand, all you see is from the gun window up and that blends into an oak 
motte behind the stand.

PIG STAND (new)
The ground blind was then moved from boneyard to a new location just west 
and a little north of the windmill and tank in the half section. The spot is 
very good, providing a look due west for several hundred yards into the 
heart of the draw in the half section. You can also look south a long way 
and have good view of a game trail leading to the tank.
We moved the feed pen around the corn barrel at the old pig stand and set it 
up in this new location. The protein barrel stayed put and is about 500 
yards to the south and west.

Mertz has reclaimed two of his barrels and two of his spincast motors (I 
gave him the poorest performing motors and the two barrels without varmit 
cages). As a result, we needed to pull the 30/30 barrel to locate at the new 
pig stand. We took the 10 foot tripod back to the trailer. This leaves us 
with 9 solid stand locations. 9 good feeders (assuming the Lehman feeder at 
boneyard is working well and sweeny is working). We will need to make a 
magnum conversion on the barrel at the mesquite flat for next year. IF all 
motors are working we will have two green tubes for back ups. I think we 
should invest in one more magnum motor as a back up. I will look for one on 
sale.

Keith, the new pig stand is ready to hunt with the old box blind from 
boneyard, so the construction of a new box is not necessary. HOWEVER, if you 
and the boys need a summer project, a lonestar type size box would be great, 
but it does not need a tower. A couple of cinder blocks or those concrete 
blocks at the trailer is all the height you need. Any more and it actually 
won't work. The blind location is under a big oak (like the hideout), a 
tower of any height will raise the box up too high into the branches. Also, 
Chris should have brought home the lehman feeder motor. the time was right, 
but would not test fire. Don't know if battery was completely dead (solar 
deal was hooked up) or if its motor is shot. Please check it out so we can 
have confidence in that motor next year. It gave us a bad time at the 
boneyard last season.

Next Fall's work weekend should be easy, if we have solid participation from 
lease members. It would be a good idea to look at your calendars now. Labor 
day will be out for me this year (although everyone else is welcome to 
select that and run with it). How about the 14th or 28th?? Please check your 
calendars and let me know what works best for you.

Fall TO DO
1)standard filling barrels, putting on motors, trimming shooting lanes and 
opening up blinds (killing wasps, oiling chairs).
2)switch barrels at showtime and hole to allow hole to hold more bags of 
corn. This will increase the capacity and hopefully allow it to remain full 
if we have rain that prevents us from getting down there to refill the 
feeder.
3)little bit more chainsaw work at boneyard to open up shooting lanes to 
west towards fence and south.
4)Install new box at pig stand??? If keith and boys build one.
5)Install lock on trailer door to protect valuables (kegerator and beer)
6)Install lock on gun cabinet for child saftey.
7)Hunt doves and drink draft beer, sweat and smell bad.

Erik.

"ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES","To: Enron Employees Worldwide 
From: Stephen Cooper 
Date: Friday, April 19, 2002 
I am disappointed to announce the resignation of Jeff McMahon as president and chief operating officer of Enron. Last fall, during tremendous turmoil within the organization, Jeff stepped up as a true leader. He has worked tirelessly to create value for our stakeholders and as an advocate for employees. With great enthusiasm, he has focused on the future and on structuring a viable business that can emerge from bankruptcy. 
However, Jeff has decided that it is best for Enron that he step down at this time. When I met with him earlier this week, Jeff expressed his belief that making room for new leadership before we announce the plan for the new company is best for Enron's stakeholders and for him. While I regret Jeff's decision, I respect it. 
Effective June 1, Jeff will no longer be an officer or an employee of Enron. However, he has agreed to be available to assist with the reorganization efforts, if needed. His knowledge and vision will continue to be a benefit to us as we make our way through the restructuring process. 
Looking down the road, I expect to work with senior management and the board to identify someone external to Enron to fill the top leadership position within the reorganized company. I will keep you updated on that effort. The Office of the Chief Executive will continue to be comprised of Ray Bowen and me after Jeff's departure. I want to thank you for your ongoing commitment and support of our reorganization efforts. 
To read the press release, go to <http://home.enron.com> and look under New & Notable.

"FW: Duke $","FYI

Joe Parks just completed the sale of the gas in storage at the Centana Facility.  Below you will see confirmation of our receipt of the sales price.  Joe will send to me (and I can forward to any interested party) the methodology for the sales price calculation.  Of this amount, approximately $225,000 will be escrowed (these are for pre-petition obligations under the storage agreement with Centana) subject to some future resolution.  My understanding is that Ed McMichael and his team will be evaluating what to do with the Centana Storage Agreement (accept or reject).

To all,
I have asked Louis DiCarlo and Joe Parks to contact you to arrange to meet today to review the positions in the wholesale and retail gas books.

Greg/Pat, please pull the current positions (like you have done before) but for each month from the live, ITM counterparties

Scott/Dave/Jess, please do same for the portion of the retail gas book that is designated for retention (not the OTM positions or positions that have or will be rejected and terminated).  If necessary, consider setting up a separate book for the OTM positions.  Also, if you are not currently doing so, please start marking all retail curves at the locations that we have positions.  

Please forward the position information to Louis, Joe and Elena Chilkina as soon as possible, but no later than 12:00 Noon today.  If you have issues, please let me know.  Otherwise, I want to meet with all of you at 4:00 PM today in ECN 4105 to review the positions and discuss issues.

Thanks,
Ed

Just an update. I spoke with Mike Richards and later today he will send
me the rest of his comments so that we can be ready to finalize the deal
if Greg returns and is ready to pull the trigger. 

Mike inquired of their bank and apparently they can open an escrow
account with slightly lower fees. Mike thinks the difference is about
$1500. Given the lack of control over the process and the fact that we
have an escrow account already finalized, I told him that I didn't think
ENA was interested in their opening another account, but I wanted to
check with you Joe.

Last, I checked and there is no jeopardy from a bankruptcy perspective
of finding a new buyer for the gas in the event that Centana declines to
move forward.

Joe,

Based on our discussions, the facts are as follows: Prior to 12/2/01,
ENA sold gas to One Oak.  During the period 12/4-12/31/01, Duke Field
Services inadvertently flowed gas on the MRT pipeline to ENA. ENA used
the gas received from Duke Field Services to fulfill its obligations
under the sales agreement to One Oak.  

ENA is obligated to pay Duke Field Services for the gas it received and
later delivered to One Oak because this event occurred post-petition and
benefited ENA.

He is looking for new hunters. He just kicked a guy off a 4,700 acre lease 
and he had a guy go into bankrucy on a company lease on 5,400 acres. He is 
going to put an add in the houston chronicle. If you guys know anyone 
looking for a lease of that size, might want to call mertz for more info and 
put them in touch.

He also suggested that he is still looking for a farmer to plant one field 
in milo for dove hunting and one in fall vegetation for deer hunting. If he 
does one in milo, he was thinking he could use it for a little dove hunting 
for himself and friends. I told him we would probably not have a problem 
with that arrangement in return for him getting the fields planted. I'll 
believe it when I see it.

Right now, the plant is down and gas being purchased under contract is out of the money.  Joe Parks is reselling the gas that was scheduled going into the month to TXU and isn't dealing (yet) with the imbalance that was carried forward as a result of prior months' activity.  Ideally, he would cut back scheduled gas and start working off the imbalance.  Did we ever get a read on the PPEP supply/transport contracts in terms of flexibility to meet contract mins?

Greg,

Good morning. Enron was paying for a pretty large weather package from us,
so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package. Were there just certain
products you were using? For example, our basic package, which includes the
1-15 day maps, the 16-city forecasts, the 30-day outlook, and phone access
is $450/month. The noon update would be an additional $150/month. Since you
are a smaller group, I can apply a discount as well...perhaps as much as
20%. Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put
together a package and quote for you fairly quickly. I'm attaching our
standard price sheet for your reference as well.

Take care,

was wondering what you wouyld charge for us to pick up the service.  Weare a

Can you quote me what the cost would be to continue the service.  My phone

 <<iEne042902b_0713.pdf>>

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 4/29/2002.

Over the past six months we have been very bullish on U.S. energy stocks
based upon our conviction that U.S.

natural gas supply would deteriorate sharply with the reduced drilling
activity. As publicly-traded U.S. E&P

companies have begun to announce their first quarter production results,
the supply deterioration has been shocking even to us. Specifically, with
about one-third of total U.S. gas production represented, it appears that
first quarter 2002 U.S. gas production is trending down about 3%
sequentially and more than 6% on a year-over-year basis. As we move into
the second quarter, we think we will continue to see sequential declines in
U.S. gas production and a growing year-over-year gap in U.S. gas
production. Since a supply problem is much harder to correct than a demand
problem, it appears that our optimism on U.S. gas prices has not only been
well founded, but may even prove to be too conservative. In other words,
this falling U.S. natural gas supply is an extremely bullish data point for
U.S. gas prices as we move into the summer and especially going into next
winter.

I noticed that a few of you had revised/validated several curves and that your work was not accurately reflected on the Progress Summary sheets. These sheets are an essential reporting tool for project management. Please update the progress sheets with your recent work or communicate your progress to Kathy Kelly so that she can perform the updates on your behalf if necessary. As a reminder, the sheets are located at O:\CurveValidation\Estate Reporting\Gas organized by region (Progress Summary - East, Progress Summary - Texas, etc.).

Also, when you complete a template by either revising or validating the ERMS pricing data, please remember to place an ""R"" or ""V"" in the yellow box near the top of the template. 

Thanks for your help.

"BTRC Meeting on Centana / Applied Terravision / Bridgeline","This is to confirm my understanding of the BTRC's resolutions on the presentations made on Centana, Applied Terravision and Bridgeline.

Centana - The transaction was presented and no objections were raised.  I plan to work with Chip Schneider of the RAC group to circulate the DASH and have it executed.  I will also work with the commercial counterparty to finalize a transaction that is consistent with the terms presented in the DASH.

Applied Terravision - The deal was discussed and all parties agreed that it made sense to sell the warrants prior to the anticipated closing of the AT and COG merger (expected 3/15) in order to insure that some profits accrue to the benefit of ENA's creditors.  That being said, it was determined that it wasn't worth expending any political capital with the Bankruptcy court in order to obtain the expeditious treatment that would be required.  Melanie Gray is scheduled to speak with John Frankini (sp?) of Milbank later today to determine whether this sale could be construed as an ordinary course disposition.  If they jointly conclude that it can be, we will move forward with the sale of the warrants unless the buyer insists upon a court order.  I expect to hear back from Melanie later today.  Assuming that I get the green light, Jeff Bartlett and I will get the DASH circulated and work to complete the sale of the warrants. 

Bridgeline - We discussed the need to pay bonuses and give merit increases to the Bridgeline employees.  Everyone seemed to be on-board provided that we made sure that the ENA seconded employees would not participate in any ENA retention plan but rather just be limited to the proposed Bridgeline bonuses and merit raises.  Ray Bowen has already communicated with Robert Jones to make sure that the ENA/Bridgeline employees will not be double-dipping and therefore, my understanding is that we have the necessary approval to vote in favor of paying these amounts (a bonus schedule was provided at the meeting and retention was discussed as being 3.5% of current salaries).

Please advise as soon as possible if you believe that I am in error on any of the foregoing points.

Thanks

Stuart

"RE: are you all dead?","Man, you're not supposed to ask for money on a Friday afternoon!!  Save that
for Mondays!

Anybody up for RUSH?!?!?  Coming Friday August 16th.  Could be a blast from
the past.  We can act like teenagers again, although the recovery could take
all weekend.  I'll need to try and find my old ""NUGENT"" concert shirt I wore
for my entire 8th grade year to truly replicate my teenage years.

Subject: are you all dead?


What's the deal. No traffic all week. Makes coming to work really lame.

Here's something to talk about. Karnes City!!! Like it is time to cut checks

again and mail them to the opielas before they call me and hit me up for a 
raise on our rent.

John:Last year looks like the break down was as follows: you wrote a ckedk 
to Rancho Grande Trust for 2,600 and collected from Mark and Matt. I wrote
one for 900 and collected from pig, shet, smack, hudge and senior 
saftey.

SO Brian, Chet, Chad, Hudge and Joe need to cut me a check for 150 a piece 
and mail it to my office 815 walker #1447 H/T 77002.

If you are not interested in getting back on, let me know so I can fill your

spot.

John, mail your check and I will send off with mine and contract for emerick

To all,
I have asked Louis DiCarlo and Joe Parks to contact you to arrange to meet today to review the positions in the wholesale and retail gas books.

Greg/Pat, please pull the current positions (like you have done before) but for each month from the live, ITM counterparties

Scott/Dave/Jess, please do same for the portion of the retail gas book that is designated for retention (not the OTM positions or positions that have or will be rejected and terminated).  If necessary, consider setting up a separate book for the OTM positions.  Also, if you are not currently doing so, please start marking all retail curves at the locations that we have positions.  

Please forward the position information to Louis, Joe and Elena Chilkina as soon as possible, but no later than 12:00 Noon today.  If you have issues, please let me know.  Otherwise, I want to meet with all of you at 4:00 PM today in ECN 4105 to review the positions and discuss issues.

Thanks,
Ed

Chip - please put the following transaction in front of the Cash Committee for approval.  As you will recall from your discussions with Stuart Z, this is a self funding transaction where ENA will (1) sell gas in the ground (storage); (2) pay post-petition storage demand costs; and, (3) put in (third party) escrow the pre-petition amounts until such time as a mutually agreeable arrangement can be reached and the appropriate estate approval for settling pre-petition obligations are received.
 
As more fully described in the attached Batch Funding Request, the net proceeds to the estate will be approx. $1.7 million with funding anticipated in the first week of March.  
 
Call with questions.

Attached are my comments to the Batch Funding Request for Centana.
 
By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.
 
Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.
 
Thanks in advance.

Chip - please put the following transaction in front of the Cash Committee for approval.  As you will recall from your discussions with Stuart Z, this is a self funding transaction where ENA will (1) sell gas in the ground (storage); (2) pay post-petition storage demand costs; and, (3) put in (third party) escrow the pre-petition amounts until such time as a mutually agreeable arrangement can be reached and the appropriate estate approval for settling pre-petition obligations are received.
 
As more fully described in the attached Batch Funding Request, the net proceeds to the estate will be approx. $1.7 million with funding anticipated in the first week of March.  
 
Call with questions.
 
Thanks

Chris/Joe
 
Attached are my comments to the Batch Funding Request for Centana.
 
By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.
 
Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.
 
Thanks in advance.

Stuart

>> >>6:20  Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

smoooooth 95
>> >>
>> >>10:35  Headed for San Antonio
>> >>
>> >>10:50  Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities

liquor
>> >>store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
>> >>
>> >>11:50  Arrive at the tailgate spot.  Awesome day.  Not a single cloud
in
>> >>the sky.  About 70 degrees.
>> >>
>> >>11:55  I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
>> >>
>> >>11:56  I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
>> >>
>> >>12:15  The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.  We're on the
>> >>second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred
>> >>of us).  We're hooting and hollering like wildmen.  The band doubles
back
>> >>to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes
>> >>of Texas.  AWESOME MOMENT.
>> >>
>> >>12:25  In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping
>> >>chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and
certain
>> >>of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
>> >>
>> >>1:00  The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.  Again,
we
>> >>hoot and holler like wildmen.  Again, the band doubles back and stops
right
>> >>below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight
songs.
>> >>  Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain
>> >>convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
>> >>
>> >>1:30  I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
>> >>""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
>> >>
>> >>1:47  I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans.  They are taunting me.
I
>> >>am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out
of
>> >>Nebraska.  I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to
play
>> >>what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop
Out.""
>> >>Remember flop out for a dollar?  The rules are similar.  I tell this
>> >>Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop
>> >>out"" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix
for
>> >>the Fiesta Bowl.   And then I spoke these memorable words:  ""And not
those
>> >>damn refundable tickets, either!  You request those non-refundable,
>> >>non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!""   He backs down.  He is unworthy.
I
>> >>call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable
and
>> >>non-transferrable.  Price:  $712.  He is humbled.  He lowers his head
in
>> >>shame.  I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas
>> >>fans. I am KING and these are my subjects.  I distribute the 11 beers
in my
>> >>pants to the cheering masses.  I RULE the pre-game kingdom.
>> >>
>> >>2:34  Kickoff.  Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour
my
>> >>first stiffy.
>> >>
>> >>2:45  I notice something troubling:  Nebraska is big.  Nebraska is
fast.
>> >>Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
>> >>
>> >>3:01  The first quarter mercifully ends.  9 yards total offense for
Texas.
>> >>Zero first downs for Texas.  I'm still talking shit.  I pour another
stiffy
>> >>from the Traveler.
>> >>
>> >>3:36  Four minutes to go in the first half:  the Traveler is a dead
>> >>soldier.  I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants.  While I
am
>> >>standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and
>> >>rolls out of the end zone.  Safety.
>> >>
>> >>3:56  Halftime score:  Nebraska 15, Texas 0.  I wish I had another
>> >>Traveler.
>> >>
>> >>4:11  While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at
halftime, I
>> >>attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
>> >>""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock.""  He is unamused.
>> >>
>> >>4:21  I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants.  I
share
>> >>my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me.  Surprisingly,
they
>> >>are equipped with a flask full of vodka.  I send them off to purchase
$5
>> >>Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka.  I have not lost faith.
>> >>Nebraska is a bunch of pussies.
>> >>
>> >>4:51  No more vodka.  The girls sitting behind me have fled for their
>> >>lives.  I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
>> >>
>> >>5:18  Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0.  I am beginning to lose faith.
This
>> >>normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football
field.
>> >>
>> >>5:27  I call Southwest Airlines:  ""I'm sorry, sir.  Those tickets have
been
>> >>confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
>> >>
>> >>5:37  I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession
>> >>counter.  As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be
>> >>sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock.  I am
enraged by
>> >>this policy.  I ask loudly:  ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last
call
>> >>over the fucking PA system??!!""
>> >>
>> >>5:49  Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat.  All of a
>> >>sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts.  ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
>> >>awaking from my coma, ""Iz we winnig?  Did wez scort?""  Alas, the answer
is

cheer

walking

the

zone.
>> >>I cheer wildly.  I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my
tongue in
>> >>it.  I am thirsty.
>> >>
>> >>6:16  Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck.  I
would
>> >>taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am
too
>> >>drunk to form complete sentences.  With my last cognitive thought of
the
>> >>evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
>> >>October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
>> >>
>> >>6:30  Back in the car.  On the way back to Austin for the 8:00
>> >>Texas-Arizona tip off.  We can still salvage the day!  I crack open a
beer.
>> >>  It is warm.  I don't care.
>> >>
>> >>7:12  We have stopped for gas.  I am hungry.  I go inside the store.  I
>> >>walk past the beer frig.  I notice a Zima.  I've never had a Zima.  I
>> >>wonder if it's any good.  I pull a Zima from the frig.  I twist the top
off
>> >>and drink the Zima in three swallows.  Zima sucks.  I replace the empty
>> >>bottle in the frig.
>> >>
>> >>7:17  There is a Blimpie Subs in the store.  I walk to where the
>> >>ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub.  There is no
one
>> >>there.  I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black
>> >>olives.  I eat them.  I am still hungry.  I lean further over the
counter
>> >>and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami.  I walk out of the store
>> >>grunting and eating Pastrami.  The patrons in the store fear me.  I
don't
>> >>care.
>> >>
>> >>8:01  We are in South Austin.  I have been drinking warm beer and
singing
>> >>Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour.  My truck-mate is tired of my
>> >>singing.  He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other
good
>> >>songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon""
and
>> >>that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
>> >>excessive.  Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its
own.
>> >>I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
>> >>
>> >>8:30  We arrive at the Erwin Center.  My truckmate, against my loud and
>> >>profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking
garage.
>> >>I tell him he's an idiot.  I tell him we will never get out.  I tell
him we
>> >>may as well pitch a fucking tent here.  He ignores me.  I think he's
still
>> >>pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes.  I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
>> >>
>> >>8:47  I am rallying.  I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants.  We're
going
>> >>to kick the shit out of Arizona.
>> >>
>> >>9:11  Halftime score:  Texas 31, Arizona 29.  I am pleased.  I go to
the
>> >>bathroom to pee for the 67th time today.  I giggle to myself because of
the
>> >>new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice.""  There are no Arizona fans
in
>> >>the bathroom.  I am disappointed.  I tell myself (out loud)  that I
have a
>> >>""Niiiiiice cock.""  No one is amused but me.
>> >>
>> >>9:41  I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.
>> >>Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center, much less
Bud
>> >>Light out of a can.  I am stopped by an usher:  ""Where did you get
that,
>> >>sir?""  I tell him (no shit):  ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them
up
>> >>with those little plastic footballs.  Would you mind throwing this away
for
>> >>me?""  I take the last swig and hand it to him.  He is confused.  I
pretend
>> >>I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead.  I duck
into
>> >>some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me.  I sneak into
a
>> >>large group of people and sit down.  The usher walks by harmlessly.  I
am
>> >>giggling like a little girl.  I crack open another can of Bud Light.
>> >>
>> >>9:52  I am lost.  In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lost my
bearings.
>> >>I have no ticket stub.  I cannot find my seats.  Texas is losing.
>> >>
>> >>10:09  Texas is being screwed by the refs.  I am enraged.  I have
cleared
>> >>out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
>> >>surrounding chairs with it.  A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps
I
>> >>shouldn't take it so seriously.  I tell him to fuck off.
>> >>
>> >>10:15  After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER
seen,""
>> >>I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.
>> >>However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my
left
>> >>eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye.  I am now bleeding
>> >>into my left eye and all over my shirt.  ""Perhaps,"" I think to myself,
""I'm
>> >>taking this a bit seriously.""
>> >>
>> >>10:22  I am standing in the bathroom peeing.  I'm so drunk I am swaying
and
>> >>grunting.  I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye.  My pants are
>> >>bloody.  I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist.  I
look
>> >>like I should be in an episode of Cops.
>> >>
>> >>10:43  Texas has lost.  I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and
>> >>make my way for the exits.  I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
>> >>samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
>> >>merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
>> >>
>> >>10:59  With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage.  I walk
up
>> >>six flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch
him
>> >>in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the
truck,
>> >>and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck.  I look around and
notice
>> >>that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole
flights,
>> >>and no one is moving.  I take a nap.
>> >>
>> >>11:17  I awake from my nap.  I see my friend in the driver's seat.  I
lift
>> >>my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is
lined
>> >>up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is
moving.

cocksucker.""

>> >>
>> >>11:58  I am jostled.  The truck is moving.  I lift my head to look out
the
>> >>bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the
second
>> >>floor.  I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking
facility,
>> >>and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below.  My friend looks at
me
>> >>like I just anally violated his minor sister.  I turn around and pee on
the
>> >>front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
>> >>
>> >>12:11  We are moving.  We are out of beer.  I jump from the truck and
go
>> >>from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers.  I am happy.
I
>> >>return to my vehicle.
>> >>
>> >>12:26  We have emerged from the parking facility.  We make our way to
my
>> >>apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of
>> >>Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him.  We are all going to die
>> >>tonight.
>> >>
>> >>12:59  We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet.  We

full

pieces.
>> >>We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
>> >>
>> >>1:17  The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to

laughter,

doors in
>> >>this town for almost 5 years.  And I can honestly say that I ain't
never

>> >>
>> >>1:44  We find a bar that lets us in.  We take two steps in the door and
>> >>hear ""Last call for alcohol!""  I turn to the group and mutter:  ""See,
dat
>> >>wasn't that fuckin' hard.  Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the
>> >>awaom...the alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today...""  We order
6
>> >>shots of tequila and three beers.
>> >>
>> >>2:15  Back on the street.  We need food.  We hail a cab to take us the
two

and
>> >>tell him to keep it.
>> >>
>> >>2:17  There is a 20 minute wait.  We give the hostess $50.  We are

Subject: Possible new lease member

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to 
fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head 
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they 
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and 
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot. 
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking 
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out 
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and 
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I 
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could 
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up 
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two 
spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this 
spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be 
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

"Enron Employees Talk to NPR","
Last week, several Enron employees participated in a roundtable discussion for National Public Radio's Marketplace.  The discussion, which focused on working at Enron today and the company's efforts to reorganize, was positive and upbeat.  In Houston, the segment is scheduled to run tonight, April 29 at 6:30 p.m. CST on KUHF 88.7 FM.  Employees outside of Houston should check their local NPR listing for Marketplace air times.  The segment also will be available later today on NPR's website: www.npr.org.

"Organizational Announcement","To:  Enron Employees Worldwide
From:  Steve Cooper
I am disappointed to announce the resignation of Cindy Olson as executive vice president of Human Resources and Employee Relations, effective July 15, 2002.  After nearly 25 years with Enron, Cindy has decided to leave to assist her husband in his trucking and transportation business.  Her commitment and enthusiasm, even during these difficult times, have been inspiring and will be missed.
Robert Jones, managing director in Human Resources, will assume Cindy's responsibilities and join Enron's Management Committee.  Robert joined Enron in 1980 and has held numerous managerial positions.  Prior to Enron's bankruptcy, Robert led Human Resources for Enron Wholesale Services.  Robert was instrumental in developing the retention and severance plan that was ultimately approved by the creditors' committee and the court.  His experience and leadership will be invaluable as we move forward in our restructuring efforts.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count. 
Please call Shirley Crenshaw at 3-5290 to register.

        I don't normally make the nom. & I would suggest that we follow the format that you
        have outlined.  We do need to incorporate the Recoupment Agreement now with NNG
        which has not been executed as of yet   I'm having to work through attorney's to get 
        confirmation that we can execute.  
 
        I don't believe Joe has a market to sell the gas into.  The nom needs to be made with
        NNG so that we account for and capture the gas payment whether it's to be sold or just
        used to offset some of the imbalance.

"RE: age of joe's deer","I think you are right on there...I'm just telling you that if you had seen that 10 point I shot ""on the hoof"", not dead on the ground w/ a cut out lower jaw for inspection, you would have said ""Damn, that's an old deer."" 
Compared to his Identical Offspring. Same body size, Same EXACT antler formation (9"" g-2's, with a 2 inch kicker coming out sideways from his left G-2, and crab claw) The only difference b/w these 2 deer was the young one had about 2 inches more spread, and about 15 inches more total antlers) Mass was more on my deer, indicating age. The BIG difference was standing side by side, the younger one looked like a ""thoroughbread Horse"", while mine looked like a mule...if you can understand that. That being said, if we think that we are underestimating age on the hoof and putting all the criteria together about what ""formula"" makes a old deer look old, I would have to say that My 10 point was ""Mature and on his way down"" while the young one (Same deer that Keith has seen, too) is ""Mature and on his way up"". The last thing I have to say about that was that the ""Young"" deer of the two was definitely the ""dominant"" of the two as well. He was aggressive towards my ""ol' bastard"" and the old guy didn't want any part of him...The young one was passed on harvesting by both Keith and myself and I chose to harvest the older one of the two. Put in the same arena with a bunch of does and his younger sibling, that younger sibling was gonna get the chance to ""pour the Chili"" while the old guy snuck in from the brush, got bullied away by the ""stud"", ate enough to survive, and silently sneaked away. Meanwhile the younger stud, ate and chased does around to his hearts content, no worries about anything. Which deer needed to get shot in that scenario?
My final answer...my deer..7.5 yrs or older. His son, 4.5 and about to be a Texas Big Game Award winner next season if he lives through the summer and doesn't ""disappear"" like a lot of the other bucks we never see again from year to year.

Shares of Independent Power 
Producers and Traders Fall 




By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/images/spacer.gif>

[News item from Reuters] Renewed concerns over accounting irregularities and heavy debt burdens took their toll on the power sector on Wednesday, sending shares of independent producers and traders falling. The downturn was triggered by disclosures in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of a financing arrangement used by Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) which prompted unwelcome comparisons to Enron as well as an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into energy trader and pipeline operator Williams Cos. (NYSE: WMB). 

Analysis: Just when the market conditions appeared to be stabilizing for the recently hard-hit independent power producers (IPPs), more unwanted bad news has once again plagued this sector. In addition to Dynegy and Williams, companies such as Calpine, Mirant and AES have had significant news in the past week as the companies make moves to weather the storm of business losses, lowered credit ratings, softening energy commodity prices, and questions of accounting practices. Let's take a look at the latest developments for these companies. 

Dynegy shares closed at $28.79 per share, down by about 4 percent, as the market reacted to a WSJ article concerning Dynegy's use of off-balance-sheet transactions designed to cut tax bills and address a growing gap between cash flow and net income. Project Alpha, as it was called, was blessed by Dynegy's former auditor, Andersen, and current auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers. Dynegy was quick to try and distinguish this transaction from the type of business practices that Enron engaged in. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa emphasized, ""The primary drivers of this transaction were that it provided us with a long-term source of physical gas supply and a significant tax benefit."" Sousa also pointed out that no related parties were involved, Dynegy stock was not used to back the loans, and the transaction was disclosed in Dynegy's financial reports last year. In 2000 the company reported ""unrealized gains"" of $354 million generated by valuing derivative contracts, increasing the gap between its profit and cash flow. Trading companies include the estimated value for ""derivative"" contracts they use for future buying and selling of commodities in net income as ""unrealized gains."" A special purpose entity (SPE) was formed in April of last year with a $300-million loan from Citigroup Inc. The SPE entered into gas trades with a partnership called DMT Supply LP, in which Dynegy held a stake. According to Dynegy, during the first nine months of operation, DMT bought gas from the entity at below-market prices and resold the gas at a profit. But during future years of the project scheduled to end in 2006, DMT will buy gas at above-market gas prices, generating unrealized losses. By arranging transactions in this manner, Dynegy was able to lower its 2001 tax bill by $80 million. But according to WSJ, higher values were being assigned to derivative contracts than those assigned to cash transactions which creates a ""disconnect"" between reported net income and cash flow that investors could notice. 

Williams shares also dropped by 4.5 percent on Wednesday to close at $23.08 per share on news from WSJ, which reported that the SEC is looking into the company's third-quarter results. In reaction, Williams clarified that it had received a request in early February from the SEC for additional information concerning the company's 2001 third-quarter results but was told after a review that no financial adjustments were needed. Williams' spokesperson Jim Gipson said, ""We received an informal, confidential request for information by the SEC in early February about our third-quarter 10Q. They asked a couple of questions, we responded in writing, they called back in seven days and said no amendment to the third-quarter results was required."" Gipson emphasized that, ""We are not aware of any unresolved or open issues at the SEC."" Williams reported a third-quarter net income of $221.3 million, up from $176.5 million, or 27 cents a share, earned in the same quarter one year ago. The quarter included a one-time charge of $71 million for the company's investment in former subsidiary Williams Communications Group. On March 7, Williams announced it had taken a $2.1-billion charge in the fourth quarter to account for its contingent liability on Williams Communications. Williams reported a loss of $477.7 million for the fourth quarter. 

Calpine shares were down 6.26 percent yesterday apparently in reaction to news that Moody's had downgraded Calpine's unsecured debt from Ba1 to B1, along with a negative ratings outlook. Approximately $12.4 billion of long-term debt instruments are affected. This follows a March 29 report, when the company disclosed that it will restate 2001 earnings after the company discovered that emission-reduction credits it had purchased last year were not actually available. In a press release, Calpine said 2001 earnings would be lowered by $11.5 million after tax from the $659.6 million reported on Jan. 31. The restatement will drop 2001 diluted earnings per share after extraordinary items by 3 cents a share, to $1.87. 

Moody's sited several reasons for the ratings downgrades including Calpine's high leverage, limited financial flexibility, and substantial ongoing capital expenditure requirements to complete its reduced build-out program. Calpine's debt is expected to grow over the coming year as the company continues its development of committed projects. While Calpine's total electric sales are expected to increase as it completes additional plants, it is expected to be selling into unfavorable market conditions. Moody's anticipated that lower spark spreads (the difference between electric and fuel prices) will lower in the near term. Moody's warned that the negative outlook reflects the possibility of additional downgrades should Calpine's liquidity position further deteriorate or its cash flow fall below expectations. Calpine plans to fund completion of 22 gas-fired power projects and 2 project expansions during 2002 and 2003. Moody's also assigned a Ba3 rating to Calpine's $2 billion of senior secured credit facilities. According to Moody's, the Ba3 rating reflects the benefits and limitations of Calpine's collateral package. A portion of the collateral package consists of Calpine's equity interests in Saltend and nine U.S. power plants. A principal part of the collateral package is Calpine's natural-gas properties, which may be subject to fluctuation in value based on changes in reserves and gas prices. Moody's claims a portion of these gas reserves is not proven. 

Mirant also continues to experience hard times. Its shares were down 6.21 percent to close at $13.60 per share. Although yesterday's downturn may have largely been driven by the overall downturn in the sector, Mirant has been involved in several interesting announcements this week as it continues to try to shore up its balance sheet. On April 1 it was reported that Mirant has put its Kogan Creek power station and Wilkie Creel coal mine in Queensland up for sale. Queensland's government-owned CS Energy, currently 40-percent owner of Kogan Creek, is reported to be a potential buyer, as are MIM and Macarthur Coal. In a separate transaction announced on March 27, Cleco agreed to buy Mirant's 50-percent interest in a 725-megawatt power plant the companies are building in northeastern Louisiana. The merchant power plant is owned by a joint venture between the two companies. Cleco said it would assume Mirant's $19.5-million equity commitment and pay $48 million to retire Mirant's project debt. Cleco said it would finance the buyout with a combination of new common stock and debt. 

AES has also fallen on tough times. Although the company's stock was up yesterday to close at $8.96 per share, the company continues to struggle. Early this week, AES sent a shockwave through the U.K. market when it announced its decision to put its 363 MW Fifoots Point coal-fired power plant located in Wales into receivership. The recommissioning of Fifoots in late-1999 was funded with a $214.5-million loan arranged and underwritten by Deutsche Bank. Richard Hill, joint administrative receiver at KPMG in London, who is charged with selling the asset, says Fifoots has some GBP80 million of non-recourse bank debt obligations as well as other liabilities that have yet to be fully determined. Similar to the U.S. market, wholesale prices in the U.K. reportedly have collapsed by 30 percent after the launch of last spring's new bilateral trading system. Accordingly, one report claims at least a dozen project loans are either in technical default, have broken their covenants, or are very close to not meeting their coverage ratio. 

In other AES-related news this week it was announced that GE would be purchasing AESGener's 40-percent stake in the Servicios Integrales de Generacion de Energia Electrica (Sigen) services company for an undisclosed amount. GE already owned 60 percent of the joint venture. AESGener, controlled by AES, posted losses of Pesos $5,027mil in 2001 compared to a profit of Pesos $2,275mil in 2000. Operating results were down by 12.5 percent to Pesos $70,241mil on sales declining 23.8 percent to Pesos $347,009mil. The performance of AES' Argentinean subsidiaries TermoAndes and InterAndes, and selling off the subsidiaries Central Puerto and Puerto Ventanas imposed losses. Recently appointed AESGener Chairman Roberto Morgan commented that the company will continue to divest in non-electric assets and assets not based in Chile. 

The fallout of the Enron debacle, lowered credit ratings, and weak commodity prices are providing a 1-2-3 blow that has many energy companies on the ropes struggling to make the bell. The companies are aggressively working to put up a defense by shoring up their balance sheets through asset sales, postponing or canceling projects and taking necessary write-offs. But as quickly as these companies' fortunes have nosedived, they can rise once again. Such is the fickle nature of the commodity world.

"FW: Dominion prepay for City of Tallahassee deal for March 2002","Per David Walker at Dominion - for February, his supplier said we received 104,793 dth.  Using my calculation down below, we paid Dominion (and billed Tallahassee) for 100,000 dth.  I would like to verify that Tallahassee received 104,793 dth, then bill Tallahassee for the additional 4,793 dth and pay Dominion for the same amount.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

"Possible new lease member","Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to 
fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head 
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they 
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and 
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot. 
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking 
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out 
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and 
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I 
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could 
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up 
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two 
spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this 
spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be 
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

1)  Gerald, you are a scumbag for leaving.  The Pan Canadian folks negotiate that weak kneed sissies and drink tea with milk....with their pinky extended.  Regardless, you bring down the average I.Q., but strengthen their resolve.
2)  The Batch Funding Request is done (subject to one final review by Zisman...known is business circles as crater boy, a.k.a. Bridgeline wanna-be).  We are to get this in front of the Cash Committee ASAP and presented as ordinary course of business.  Chip is waiting on us (that is embarrassing).

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.  The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.  The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas.

These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets.

Enron North America-Upstream Products
Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. 
Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu.  
Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.
ENA West Power
Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

IN THE NEWS

""To truly understand Enron's Jeffrey Skilling - the hypersmart, hyperconfident chief executive of what may now be the largest energy trading company on the planet - head to your local video store and check out that classic American cinema, Wayne's World.  At 15, Skilling helped launch a no-budget television station in Aurora, Illinois - the very thing that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey so famously spoofed on Saturday Night Live and in two movies.  The TV skit even begins with a sketch of a teenage cameraman, the role of the real-life Skilling."" --- Randall Lane, Worth Magazine. May 2001.

Calgary, Alberta -- Enron Canada has settled its lawsuit with NGX, Canadian Enerdata, OM Gruppen and Richard Zarzeczny, regarding the compilation and methodology for calculating the Alberta natural gas price indices published by the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.  By the terms of the settlement there will be a joint press release issued regarding the settlement, which is to be the only public communication regarding the matter unless agreed to by all parties. Otherwise the settlement is confidential to the parties.  Accordingly, there is to be no formal or informal discussion with media, colleagues, competitors, counterparties or otherwise.

NUGGETS & NOTES

Reminder:  Brown Bag Lunch, Thursday, May 17 at 11:30 AM in 5 C2. The speaker is Michael L. Miller discussing Principal Investments.

""Historically, Newsprint has been sold under strong relationships as a highly differentiated, branded product to ""very discriminating"" buyers at newspaper publishers. EIM believed differently.  By the end of March, EIM had succeeded in closing on its 2nd Newsprint mill, making it the 7th largest Newsprint manufacturer in North America.  Remarkably, in just 2 months, EIM's Newsprint team has succeeded in closing $100MM total notional value ""Enron commodity style"" fixed price contracts with terms of 1 to 5 years?..and they said it wasn't a commodity.""
Rodney Malcolm - Vice President, Forest Products Sales and Marketing

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron closes major coal deal in Germany
After almost six months of negotiations, Enron's coal team has signed a contract with Stadtwerke Bremen to supply this major German municipality with coal until 2006. Under the deal structure, Enron will deliver a total of 4.6 million tonnes of coal - equivalent to an overall contract volume of almost $200 million  (DM 440 million).

The agreement represents Enron's first significant long-term coal supply deal in Germany. The annual contractual volume amounts to around 3% of total German coal imports and provides us with continuous volume flow in Northern Germany, enabling us to grow our position in the market.

Parallel to this deal, Enron also entered into a separate agreement with HMS Bergbau Agentur, a company specialising in Polish exports. Under this agreement, HMS will be the handling agent and a potential supplier of Polish coal to us over the lifetime of the contract.

Congratulations to the whole team involved: Sven Becker, Manfred Ungethum, Cornelia Luptowitsch, Peter Bradley, Jez Peters and Michael Schuh.

Hi Joe, 
I am waiting to hear back from Centana's attorney. As soon as I hear

"Duke Field Services","Joe,

Based on our discussions, the facts are as follows: Prior to 12/2/01,
ENA sold gas to One Oak.  During the period 12/4-12/31/01, Duke Field
Services inadvertently flowed gas on the MRT pipeline to ENA. ENA used
the gas received from Duke Field Services to fulfill its obligations
under the sales agreement to One Oak.  

ENA is obligated to pay Duke Field Services for the gas it received and
later delivered to One Oak because this event occurred post-petition and
benefited ENA.

Subject: RE: DRAFT 2/27/02


My thoughts are as follows:

1)  Generally looks good
2)  What about Governing Law?
3)  What about a provision that makes it clear that Buyer cannot offset
this payable against any other amounts that may be owed to Duke or its
affiliates
4)  In the as-is section - my guess is that they will object to the
absence
of some title rep.  I am ok to provide a special warranty as to title to
the gas but not other reps

Please revise accordingly ASAP and forward to Duke for their
consideration.
Shemin - Joe can provide you with an email address for the commercial
contact and my guess is that you have the necessary contact info for
Duke's
counsel.

Joe - do we know what bank we are going to use.  Shemin - what about the
draft of escrow agreement?

   Here is the revised draft. I spoke with the Duke attorney and he is
   taking ""let me see it and I'll let you know"" approach so let me know
if
   you have any additional changes and I will send it over to him.

   Also, it is my understanding that we must now have a Weil Gotschal
   bankruptcy attorney sign off on the deal
   so I am trying to find out who that person is and what needs to be
done.

"RE: Cash Committee Approval for  Centana Storage Arrangement","Chip - please put the following transaction in front of the Cash Committee for approval.  As you will recall from your discussions with Stuart Z, this is a self funding transaction where ENA will (1) sell gas in the ground (storage); (2) pay post-petition storage demand costs; and, (3) put in (third party) escrow the pre-petition amounts until such time as a mutually agreeable arrangement can be reached and the appropriate estate approval for settling pre-petition obligations are received.
 
As more fully described in the attached Batch Funding Request, the net proceeds to the estate will be approx. $1.7 million with funding anticipated in the first week of March.  
 
Call with questions.

Chris/Joe
 
Attached are my comments to the Batch Funding Request for Centana.
 
By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.
 
Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.
 
Thanks in advance.

"RE: PPEP Spreadsheet","Mike,

His comment on the vintage of our transport agreement causes me to think that we'd better look pretty hard at any penalties that do come back to us that might be administered under a broader policy.  I recall seeing margin notes on a term sheet that was received by Tenaska when they asked TXU for quotes on a second unit which indicated to me that they were surprised by the proposed hourly imbalance provisions (which would be the case if the existing unit weren't subject to similar penalties).  I don't think this changes our communication with Brazos, as they need to know that if penalties are incurred, they eat 'em.  However, let's make a mental note to reveiw the Feb-Mar LS invoices to make sure they're being issued in accordance with our contract.

I understand your pain.  We are just stating what has been told to us by
the Gas Control group.

The answers to your questions are as follows:

1) The OFO will probably be in effect until sometime on Monday.

2) The Tenaska IV Texas Partners contract is very old and was written
before TXU LSP put hourly swing imbalance penalty provisions in the
Electric Generation contracts.   The main remedy for TXU LSP in the
contract is to physically resrict flow to the power plant to stay even with
gas receipt volumes or to demand that the power plant bring in receipt gas
to meet its burn.

I hope this helps.

Jeff:

The problem with all of the power plants is that somebody has to swing on
load to follow the electric profile. This may be us.

Also, how long is this OFO going to be in place??

Secondly, namely because I haven't thoroughly read the contract, what are
the imbalance penalties??

I

flat

three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired. 
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone
yard 
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other
7 
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said
his 
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease.

Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted

lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a
good 
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff
was 
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to 
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his

may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders.
we'll

"RE: Attached Files","I went through these at warp speed and (for what its worth) they appear to work.  We need to be sure that they don't get their $290k under the other arrangement before we get paid under this one.

Thanks

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 3/25/2002.

With the recent surge in U.S. natural gas prices many analysts are
scratching their heads in disbelief. Of course there will continue to be
volatility, but we believe these higher gas prices are not only
sustainable, but will likely move up through the summer (similar to what
happened in 2000). For the past two months it has become very evident that
U.S. natural gas supply/demand on a weather-adjusted basis is much tighter
than the same time last year. The market has finally begun to realize the
extent of this tightness, as more ""normal"" weather over the past several
weeks has removed a substantial amount of the natural gas storage overhang.
This shift in supply/demand should become even more evident as we move into
the early part of the injection season in April/May. Look for summer gas
injections to be down 30% to 50% from last year's numbers. This should be
the bullish driver of summer natural gas prices.

Next week, we should have even more bullish gas news, as the preliminary
numbers from our first quarter U.S. E&P production survey are likely to
surprise many on the Street. Stay tuned....

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

"PPEP Invoicing","Theresa Vos tells me that she receives invoices directly from the suppliers and also receives an estimate of where the invoices should be from Justin Fernandez.  She says the two have reconciled closely since she's been responsible for payment (she picked this up in the Jan-Feb timeframe), with actuals usually coming in below Justin's estimates.  Accordingly, she has paid the invoiced amounts directly to the supplier without further reconcilliation.

Based on the above, should I be concerned with the ""settlements"" process?

Subject: Deer Lease Report

Talked to Chris and Mertz this am.

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there

McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us.
I
pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one
flat
tire in his suburban.
three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired.
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone
yard
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other
7
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said
his
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease.

Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted

lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a
good
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff
was
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his
wife
may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders.
we'll
have to fix them up on openning weekend.

Daily Market Commentary May 10, 2001 . .

FUNDS, MANAGED ACCOUNTS BUY . . .

 Natural gas futures rallied in busy trading Thursday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Funds anticipating that a market bottom had been reached
bought aggressively to cover earlier profitable sales. Trade and commercial
accounts continue to remain on the sell side of the ledger. Tomorrow's trading
is expected to be heavily dependent on techncial parameters. . .

 At the end of the day the June contract jumped $.146 to $4.348 and July
added $.141 to $4.414 per MMBtu. . .

 ""Today was almost exclusively fund and managed account short covering.
Trade and commercial accounts made some adjustments, but they are net
short and were willing to let prices rise to $4.41,"" said Jim Duffy,
trader with GasLink, New York. . .

 ""Traders are looking at filling the gap at $4.425, and if that happens
it's a sale,"" he said. . .

 ""Locals were trying to pick tops in this upmove and got killed. When
prices rose to $4.28 to $4.30, they all got short. Buy orders came in for
500 lots and you could feel their pain. They had to sell at $4.32."" . .

 ""Below $4.30 I think the trade will try to keep prices low, but if it comes
in tomorrow at $4.35 to $4.36, look for an attempt to fill the gap at $4.425,""
he said.

Subject: No More Rollin' with Nolan



Zero graduation rate is the real cause for outrage  
Posted: Monday March 04, 2002 11:29 AM  
           
     
Sports Illustrated senior writer Phil Taylor touches on a Hot Button issue each Monday on CNNSI.com. After you read Phil's take, give us yours.  
We saw the two faces of Arkansas basketball coach Nolan Richardson last week. One was the enraged look of a man who felt he had been wronged. The other was the calm visage of a man denying that he had wronged others. Apparently, injustice only angers Richardson, who was bought out of his contract last week, when he sees himself as the victim of it, not when he's the perpetrator of it.  
By now you've probably seen the footage of Richardson's rambling tirade during a press conference in which he, among other things, complained that the media is prejudiced against him because he's African-American, and declared that he was the best thing the university had going for it. ""You can run that on every TV station in the country,"" he said when he was finished. Richardson was paranoid and pompous at the same time, a despot unraveling before our very eyes. The validity of his claim -- that he's judged more harshly than white coaches -- is open to debate, although anyone who is his school's highest-paid coach at more than $1 million per year, has a free country club membership and the use of an SUV at no charge, as Richardson did, hardly needs the NAACP to come to his aid.  
But a fact that's not in dispute is that none of the African-American athletes who entered Richardson's program from 1990 to '94 has graduated. Not a single one. That staggering truth was brought to light by last week's installment of ESPN's Outside the Lines. According to the program, Arkansas was one of 36 Division I schools with a zero percent graduation rate for African-American players during that span (which is an educational disgrace, but that's a topic for another time), but none of the other 35 had an African-American coach who was casting himself as the victim of racism at the same time.  
It was striking to see how calmly Richardson defended himself against that damning statistic on OTL, compared to the fury with which he railed against the supposed racists who have had the nerve to criticize his coaching and recruiting. His voice was even and measured as he explained that one of the main reasons his players left without diplomas is that so many of them come to school for the sole purpose of (gasp!) improving their basketball skills. Richardson made it sound as if he were the victim yet again, that kids were using his basketball program for their own selfish purposes when he thought they were just as interested in chemistry lab.  
This is hypocrisy at its most blatant. Even if everything Richardson accuses the white media of is true, nothing they have done to him has been as damaging as what his program has done to the young African-American men who have come through it. Don't tell me that he's just a basketball coach, that he can't walk every one of his kids to every one of their classes. Coaches make sure every rep their players do in the weight room is documented. They know when their backup power forward's body fat rises or falls a percentage point. They can pay just as close attention to their players' academic progress, and they can recruit only those players they think have a fighting chance to get a diploma. The coaches who really care do exactly that.  
If African-American athletes and their families can't depend on coaches of the same skin color to think about the kids as students as well as players, who can they depend on? You would think that with Richardson's obvious mistrust of many whites, he wouldn't have to be asked that question.  
I don't want to hear Nolan Richardson complain about some white columnist who says he doesn't recruit as well as he used to. I want to hear him stand up and say that whatever slights he may or may not have received during his tenure at Arkansas don't amount to a hill of beans; that his program's graduation rate for African-American players is obscene, and that as the man, as the black man, who was in charge of that program, he is ashamed of it and embarrassed by it. If he ever brings himself to utter those words, you can run that on every TV station in the country.

"Deer Lease Report","Talked to Chris and Mertz this am.

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there

McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us. I 
pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one flat 
tire in his suburban.
three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired. 
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone yard 
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other 7 
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said his 
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease. 
Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted 
lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a good 
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff was 
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to 
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his wife 
may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders. we'll 
have to fix them up on openning weekend.

"Fwd: FW: Revisions to EIA Monthly and Weekly Gas StorageEstimates","
--------- Inline attachment follows ---------

From:  <mguido@Hess.com>
Date: Thursday, June 20, 2002 4:09:52 GMT
Subject: 


Subject: FW: Revisions to EIA Monthly and Weekly Gas Storage Estimates 




Listed below is the EIA explanation that was released at the time of week's
storage data.

Revisions to EIA Monthly and Weekly Gas Storage Estimates
Measures of working gas, base gas, and total gas in storage for March 2002
based on the EIA monthly survey of all gas storage operators were released
on June 19, 2002, along with revisions for the months of November 2001
through February 2002 in the Natural Gas Monthly.

The March monthly data provided the first opportunity since the beginning of
the EIA weekly natural gas storage survey to compare the reports of monthly
and weekly surveys for weekly sample members for a comparable report period
(the end of March for the monthly survey and the weekly surveys for the
Fridays preceding and following the end of March). As a result of the
cross-survey data comparison, a number of questions were directed to the
respective respondent contacts. Many of these questions have been resolved,
resulting in new or revised submissions of data for either the monthly or
weekly surveys. Although most respondents have been prompt, a few questions
remain. Reasons for revisions in monthly and weekly data include resolution
of:
? Companies' reporting responsibilities for their field operations
? Questions about how joint operations of a field should be reported
? Questions about whether gas should be identified as base or working gas
Revisions to Derived Weekly Estimates. The recent revisions to EIA monthly
data for November 2001 through February 2002 required reestimation of the
derived estimates for the weeks in that period to conform to the methodology
for the derived estimates. The derived estimates (which are calculated to
provide comparison to prior years) are weekly stock estimates calibrated to
the EIA monthly surveys. (A description of the methodology is available at
http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/ngs/history.html.) Changes to the derived
estimates will occur whenever the EIA monthly volumes for periods prior to
March 2002 are revised. Eventually, weekly estimates based on the EIA weekly
survey (Form EIA-912) will be available for all prior period comparisons. 
The largest revision to any derived weekly stock estimate for the weeks
during November 2001-February 2002 is an increase of 50 Bcf, or 1.6 percent,
for the November 30, 2001, estimate. This adjustment is composed of
increases of 31 Bcf in the Consuming East Region and 19 Bcf in the Producing
Region. These changes represent 1.6 percent and 2.1 percent of inventories
in the respective regions. Revisions to total stocks and those stocks in the
Consuming East Region and the Producing Region in any other week are 1.6
percent or less. However, revisions to the data for the Consuming West
Region have a higher relative impact, partly owing to the smaller working
gas volumes for that region. 
Revisions to Weekly Data from the EIA-912 Survey. On June 20, 2002, the
weekly working gas stock estimates from the EIA-912 survey were revised for
all weeks from March 15, 2002, through June 7, 2002. These changes represent
an increase of 30 Bcf on average for all weeks from March 15 to June 7. As a
result of the revisions, inventories in all three regions are higher. The
average change for U.S. total inventories is less than 2 percent. The
largest average revision occurred in the East Region, where the stocks
increased by 3.2 percent. Revisions occurred in inventory levels for all
weeks and consequently had little effect on the net change estimates, which
reflect the movement in inventory estimates for two consecutive weeks. The
revisions to weekly estimates were the result of revised data reports and
the use of updated ratios for expansion of the sample reports. The use of
ratios based on monthly surveys is explained in the Methodolog

Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of
which are described below. No representation is being made that any account
will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.  In
fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical
performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any
particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical
performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of
hindsight.

In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no
hypothetical trading  record can completely account for the impact of
financial risk in actual trading.  For example, the abilities to withstand
losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading
losses are material points that can also adversely affect actual trading
results.  There are numerous other factors related to the markets in
general or to the implementation of any specific trading program that
cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical
performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading
results.

"RE: DRAFT 2/27/02","My thoughts are as follows:

1)  Generally looks good
2)  What about Governing Law?
3)  What about a provision that makes it clear that Buyer cannot offset this payable against any other amounts that may be owed to Duke or its affiliates
4)  In the as-is section - my guess is that they will object to the absence of some title rep.  I am ok to provide a special warranty as to title to the gas but not other reps

Please revise accordingly ASAP and forward to Duke for their consideration.  Shemin - Joe can provide you with an email address for the commercial contact and my guess is that you have the necessary contact info for Duke's counsel.

Joe - do we know what bank we are going to use.  Shemin - what about the draft of escrow agreement?

Here is the revised draft. I spoke with the Duke attorney and he is
taking ""let me see it and I'll let you know"" approach so let me know if
you have any additional changes and I will send it over to him.

Also, it is my understanding that we must now have a Weil Gotschal
bankruptcy attorney sign off on the deal
so I am trying to find out who that person is and what needs to be done.

Subject: Email from Adam Sieminski -- US Natural Gas Inventories Rise
Relentlessly


> Last week's 119 bcf injection into U.S. natural gas storage - the largest
> weekly injection since mid-June 1994 - leaves current storage of 1.077 tcf
> only 86 bcf below last year and 40 bcf from the middle of the 1994-1999

the

100%
> faster than the typical rate of 220 over the first six weeks of the refill
> season. If inventories rise only half that rate, at 50% faster than the
> norm, storage would pass the middle of the typical range next week and end
> October at nearly 3 tcf, or 120 bcf from the top of the range.
>
> While our projected inventory injections seem bearish, we still look for
> relatively strong price support above $4/mmBtu through the year. Even with
> inventories rising quickly, there seems to be genuine concern for the need
> to satisfy summer demand for electricity (air conditioning), especially in
> the Southwest U.S. By the end of the year, however, we expect inventory
> coverage of forward demand to be on par with normal levels.

> While we continue to feel that demand has been a major contributor to the

> Reported DOE growth of 3% in 2000, which comes with a one percentage point
> room for error due to data imperfections, comes mostly from Texas and
> Wyoming. From Canada, higher than expected production from Alberta, in
> addition to the eastern offshore, seems to have influenced the large

We have reached an agreement with JP Morgan Chase that allows us to remain in the Enron Building through March 31, 2003.  JP Morgan and other lending banks that hold the lease on this building may choose to take administrative actions to protect their rights in the bankruptcy proceedings, including foreclosing on the entity created to hold the lease.  However, this action would not impact our agreement with JP Morgan to remain in the building.  Under the agreement, we will pay taxes and rent for our office space through March of next year and make up all back taxes and rent.  We will continue to review the company's office requirements and evaluate all of our space options early next year.

"RE: Sonat Park & Loan","Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

Joe - per our discussion on Friday, any assistance you can give Mark and I in selling February TW (West Tx Pool) gas would be appreciated. We can sell more term if need be.  I will forward you, under separate email, the details.  Mark will provide the exact volume prior to the end of day.  I've already talked to Allegany Supply Development and Cook Inlet.  Neither has shown much interest.  Mark sold January's balance to Sid Richardson.  Below is a list of other potential parties that may have interest in the gas (including the contact for Sid Richardson).

Thanks

Subject: RE: Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan


The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is ""zero-rated""  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, ""Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months"".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

Attached is the information that we discussed last evening.

Please note the following -there are separate tabs for price, basis and index.
	The tabs that indicate ""OXY II Only"" are exactly that -the deals associated with the potential second bid from OXY for additional activity.
	The tabs that DO NOT indicate OXY II consolidate both the base keeper list + the OXY II activity.

If there is any doubt as to what you are looking at, check the first four lines or the worksheet.  There will be a designation of what is and is not included.

"Fishing or Golf?","Trying to determine what to slate for the weekend.  What do you think about fishing prospects?  Sat. morning?
 
If not fishing, I want to make a tee time somewhere.  Either way, I got to get on the calendar to get the ol' lady off my back about what I'm doing.
 
Thoughts, interjections, libations, deliberations?
 
Chad, the time in the ""stall"" with you last night was REAL.  Thanks.

"Centana","Just an update. I spoke with Mike Richards and later today he will send
me the rest of his comments so that we can be ready to finalize the deal
if Greg returns and is ready to pull the trigger. 

Mike inquired of their bank and apparently they can open an escrow
account with slightly lower fees. Mike thinks the difference is about
$1500. Given the lack of control over the process and the fact that we
have an escrow account already finalized, I told him that I didn't think
ENA was interested in their opening another account, but I wanted to
check with you Joe.

Last, I checked and there is no jeopardy from a bankruptcy perspective
of finding a new buyer for the gas in the event that Centana declines to
move forward.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Daily Market Commentary October 25, 2001

TRADERS SKEWER ENRON . . .

 Natural gas futures retreated in busy trading Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Much of the volatility was the result of trade and commercial accounts seeking to profit from a perception of market weakness by a prominent trade and commercial account. Other trade and commercial players bid the cash market higher with the intent of forcing liquidation of underwater short positions. Today's activity is not seen as significant in the determination of longer term price trends, and short term traders see the market working higher. . .
 
 At the end of the day, the November futures fell $.043 to $2.938 per MMBtu. The December contract eased $.068 to $3.103 per MMBtu. . .

 ""This was called the 'get Enron day'. Many customers said that Enron was short the market and at first traders ran the cash market higher. For a while the cash market was ahead of the futures by as much as 10 cents, and as soon as the gap was (partially) filled on the December charts at $3.25 to $3.30 (August 24), the bottom dropped out and when prices fell below unchanged, it got ugly,"" said a New York floor trader. . .

 ""Basically Enron was taken to the cleaners. Traders knew that Enron had to get out of positions. There was talk of funds needed to pay an SEC fine, and
traders took advantage of that."" . .

 ""There was no sympathy for Enron anywhere. Traders knew they had them on the run."" . . 

 ""I believe if prices can hold the $2.80 to $2.82 in the November, the best
plan is to come back and buy again,"" he said. . .

 ""The activity today was just a 'get Enron' tactic. Other traders were hearing the same thing from their customers.""

"RE: Deer Lease Report","Now how would you know? If that was the case, then you shouldn't have

Subject: Deer Lease Report

Talked to Chris and Mertz this am.

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there

McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us.
I 
pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one
flat 
tire in his suburban.
three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired. 
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone
yard 
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other
7 
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said
his 
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease.

Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted

lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a
good 
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff
was 
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to 
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his
wife 
may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders.
we'll 
have to fix them up on openning weekend.

Subject: CPR Texas style


Two cowboys from Texas walk
into a roadhouse to wash the
trail dust from their throats.
They stand at the bar,
drinking a beer and talking
about current cattle prices.
Suddenly, a woman at a nearby
table, who is eating a sandwich,
begins to cough.
After a minute or so, it becomes
apparent that she is in real distress.
One of the cowboys looks at her
and say, ""kin ya swaller?""
The woman shakes her head, no.
""Kin ya breathe?""
The woman begins to turn blue
and shakes her head.
The cowboy walks over to the woman,
lifts up the back of her dress,
yanks down her panties, and slowly
runs his tongue from the back
of her thigh up to the small
of her back.
The woman is so shocked, that
she has a violent spasm and the
obstruction flies out of her mouth.
As she begins to breathe again,
the cowboy walks slowly back to the
bar and takes a drink from his beer.
His partner says,
""Ya know, I'd heard of that there
""Hind Lick Maneuver, but ain't
never seen nobody do it.""

Shemin, attached below is your last draft of the letter agreement with our
additional comments.  Some of the comments we previously discussed on the
phone.  I understand my business person is having discussions with Enron
management to try and resolve a number of issues with Enron.  Therefore,
the results of those discussions may cause additional comments from us to
this Letter Agreement..  In addition, my business person is currently out
of the office, so these comments are subject to his review and additional
changes.  We are fine with the Escrow Agreement as long as it is understood
that Enron will pay all costs associated with the Escrow Agreement.

"MS150: Houston to Austin","Greetings,

I signed up for the MS150 bicycle ride from Houston to Austin on April 20-21.  One requirement is a donation of $300 to the National MS Society.  I hope to raise this minimum amount through contributions from colleagues, friends, and family; thus the purpose of this email.  With your help, you can help me raise funds to help find a cure for MS.  No donation is too small and I will provide you a receipt if necessary.

I've been training for two (2) months and it's been fun.  I've been biking off and on for a few years now but this is my first big two-day race.  And I look forward to the actual ride.

=================================================================================

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms may be mild such as numbness in the limbs or severe -- paralysis or loss of vision. 
Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are giving hope to those affected by the disease. 
The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is dedicated to ending the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis.
=================================================================================

I'll be glad to share with you my progress and any (exaggerated) road bike stories.  Thanks.

Here is the revised draft. I spoke with the Duke attorney and he is
taking ""let me see it and I'll let you know"" approach so let me know if
you have any additional changes and I will send it over to him.

Also, it is my understanding that we must now have a Weil Gotschal
bankruptcy attorney sign off on the deal
so I am trying to find out who that person is and what needs to be done.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Parking","
In yesterday's group meeting, it was noted that a number of people have been notified by their existing parking garage that their parking rights will soon be terminated.  If you are in this predicament, and alternative arrangements have not yet been provided to you, please email me back with the details including your current garage name and expected date of parking termination.  I will use this information in an effort to find alternative arrangements. 

I hope everyone found yesterday's update beneficial.  Until we get the ""peanuts back on the airplanes"" I would encourage you to bring issues to me such that we can attempt to get them resolved.

To all,
I have asked Louis DiCarlo and Joe Parks to contact you to arrange to meet today to review the positions in the wholesale and retail gas books.

Greg/Pat, please pull the current positions (like you have done before) but for each month from the live, ITM counterparties

Scott/Dave/Jess, please do same for the portion of the retail gas book that is designated for retention (not the OTM positions or positions that have or will be rejected and terminated).  If necessary, consider setting up a separate book for the OTM positions.  Also, if you are not currently doing so, please start marking all retail curves at the locations that we have positions.  

Please forward the position information to Louis, Joe and Elena Chilkina as soon as possible, but no later than 12:00 Noon today.  If you have issues, please let me know.  Otherwise, I want to meet with all of you at 4:00 PM today in ECN 4105 to review the positions and discuss issues.

Thanks,
Ed

Subject:	DEC. MRT GAS



ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). 

I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.

 I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow). Although Duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time.

"FW: DYN ($15/sh): Upcoming Bank Facility.","FYI


Randy

-----Original Message-----
From: jdietert@simmonsco-intl.com [mailto:jdietert@simmonsco-intl.com]
Sent: Monday, April 29, 2002 6:29 AM
To: Sales_Trading@simmonsco-intl.com
Subject: DYN ($15/sh): Upcoming Bank Facility.


SUMMARY:  We expect DYN to continue to decline until it hits break-up value
(we estimate low double digits) or we get a positive data point to support
the stock.  We believe potential data points that will likely move the
stock include news associated with the renegotiation of its $1.2B bank
facility (potentially out today), positive comments from DYN's 1Q02
earnings call (Tuesday morning), a response from CVX (timing uncertain),
results of the SEC inquiry (uncertain), or comments from Moodys (not likely
this week and probably not next).  We believe DYN has slightly better than
50/50% chance of being successful renegotiating its bank facility, although
the rate may be higher, and the total amount may be slightly lower.  We
expect this to stabilize the stock.  We are optimistic that the 1Q02
earnings call could provide support as well.  While we believe a decline to
the low teens is a distinct possibility, we believe long-term investors
should be buying the pain today.  We plan to tighten our break-up analysis
after the release of the 1Q02 earnings and balance sheet information.
BANK FACILITY:  DYN has a $1.2B bank facility that expires Wednesday
(5/1/02).  Bank commitments were due on Friday.  We expect commitments to
be less than the current $1.2B.  The Japanese banks, which we believe
provided $300MM originally, are not likely to participate in this round
(apparently, they have been cutting back across many sectors).  We are
expecting DYN to be successful renegotiating its bank facility, albeit at
high rates and potentially for a lower aggregate amount (maybe in the $0.8B
to $1B range).  DYN's currently has access to $1.7B in liquidity, this
could decline to $1.3B to $1.5B if the bank facility is reduced as we
expect.  In the event of a Moody's downgrade, that could trigger a
requirement of roughly $1B in collateral for existing transactions, making
liquidity tight.
COUNTER-PARTY ACTIVITY:  We believe risk-adverse counter-parties (including
producers, utilities, and utility-based marketing companies) are scaling
back business with DYN.  Generally speaking, we believe the more
established marketing & trading companies are balancing their netting
agreements, but are continuing to do business with DYN.  We believe DYN was
forced to post collateral on incremental deals earlier in the year when
Moody's placed them on negative watch.  Since Moodys has once again placed
DYN on negative watch, it is likely that they are being forced to post
collateral on incremental deals again.  However, since Moodys has not yet
downgraded DYN to below investment grade, we do not believe it has
triggered collateral requirements for existing agreements.  This
counter-party activity is similar to what Enron and MIR experienced.
However, we expect the DYN experience to be very similar to the MIR
experience.  Both MIR and DYN have substantial natural gas production
contractual commitments and equity owned power generation that helps them
meet contractual sales commitments.  MIR has proven that while a junk
rating does squeeze margins, it does not immediately shut down an
asset-backed business the way it does a pure trader (Enron).
MOODYS REVIEW:  We are expecting Moodys to sit on its current position for
a few weeks.  DYN plans to meet with Moodys later this week or next.  We do
not sense immediate urgency by Moodys to downgrade to junk.  We expect the
rating agency to perform further analysis after receiving additional
information from DYN.  Bottom line, we do not expect Moodys to provide a
positive or negative catalyst in the near-term (next week or so).
SEC INQUIRY:  We would be surprised to see the SEC find anything illegal
associated with the Alpha transaction, especially since its accounting arm
has already determined that the reclassification of cash flows was
sufficient to appropriately account for the transaction.  Perhaps the SEC
will require more discussion of the transaction, but we would be surprised
to see much more.

"golf cart","Joe, see end of message.

Pig, the cart is in fine shape and has been taken to Austin by Chris and is 
being stored at their yard. He advises that it should be retreived promptly, 
theft concerns.

Chad and I have been investigating Trailer costs. 400 to 500, unless we get 
lucky on a used one and they are scarce and we would still pay 350 for it.

Nobby Tires and lift kit can be done at Mission Equiptment for 800. to do it 
ourselves (read chad) will cost at least 500 i guess in parts.

My thoughs. If you are still uncomfortable with transporting in your truck, 
then we need to spend the money to get the trailer and drive as is and built 
a box on the back. If you think it is ok, then consider spending money to do 
tire and suspension job.
I will be in AUstin in a few weeks for depo and will be prepared to bring 
unit home in a) purchased trailer b)rented trailer c)pigs truck.
Need to make a decision here.

Joe: Any word on borrowing friends mothers trailer? Any interest in becoming 
a part owner? Any chance of being able to borrow Kim's grandfather's big ass 
trailer to be pulled by my truck???

Trailer issues per chris, pulling one axle trailer that distance is tricky. 
May wobble if load not well balanced. Probably ride better in back of truck 
or on longer two axle trailer which will track better.

Subject: Lease Update


Deer All:

Keith, great looking buck! Chris, I can't believe you passed that deer
up. 
Very generous.

Chad shot a nice 10 point. Very impressive hunt. He hunted boneyard in
the 
morning, then hopped the fence into the robertson pasture and rattled
the 
deer withing 10 yards or so and managed to connect on a running shot as
the 
deer bolted away.

I fed my Python a gobbler at LoneStar. Then shot a solid schlocho at the

Hole sunday morning.

Pictures forthcoming.

Joe's beginner's honeymoon has come to an end. He saw nothing decent 
everywhere he went.

Brian saw an impressive young 9 pt at booger. Jim videotaped it the next

morning. 21"" wide or so, short tines. Very tempting deer, but all agreed

that it was 4.5 and should go another year.

Dogs could not find Jim's deer. Dogs headed from last blood due south to

fence at highway.

Feeders are all in good shape, except Boneyard. It is running at 7 and
4:30. 
But weak. Chris indicated it needed a bigger battery. We considered
putting 
a magnum on it, but if all it needs is a new battery, we'll leave it to
you. 
We should get it running well, lots of deer in that area. One good
schlocho 
and a bladed spike that needs to be shot. I put a new battery in
Lonestar 
and we filled it up. Booger topped off with motor run time increased.
30-30 
was empty. We filled it up. Pig filled up an run time increased. We have

lots of corn, so if a feeder is not dropping lots of corn, turn up the
spin 
time and keep em full. Dropping extra corn also worked well at mesquite
and 
showtime..
Mertz will feed protien next week. I consulted with Chris and houston
boys 
openning weekend regarding mertz offer to let us buy extra protien this 
fall, since he had met the quota. We agreed to see what he would feed
but 
cap it at $500, spread across the board.

Looks like Houston boys will be retruning December 15th weekend and
closing 
weekend. I'll be bringing Henry on next trip and think it would be great
if 
Keitha nd boys would be there too.

Hope Keith and Jim can make it back as soon as possible. We winterized 
trailer on way out. Keg almost empty.

"FW: Letter re Unpaid Invoice for Post petition Deliveries","Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 (sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would ""file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA"" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.  

Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?


Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

All I need to know is if ENA received the gas as stated, and if there are any extenuating circumstances which would keep us from paying.  Otherwise I believe we need to make payments in accordance with the terms of the deal.  I'll confirm.

"FW: requested historical extract","PWC has now completed loading the Truequote data into the templates for the basis curves which we were able to cross reference.  Sorry, but it appears that they are having some issues with the index quotes, but I will keep you posted.  I will be passing out an updated list with the cross references so that you can quickly identify which curves now have Truequote in them.  These curves are now available so that you can begin shaping and revising them.  As you complete the curves, please remember to update the status report so that PWC can begin taking a look at the completed work.  The progress report has been modified to include a field for quotes entered as well as when the revisions are completed by each trader.
 
Also,  Tim has listed below the contact and phone number of the Truequote representative if you would like to contact him to see if you can more easily match up the remaining Truequote curves with the Enron curves.

The True Quote contact is Trevor Atkins.  He'd be the best person for the traders to speak with in order to clear-up curve matching issues between Enron curves and True Quote curves.

Subject: OCP Update



As of this morning, Weil  informs that the court has not yet approved the order for theordinary course professionals, so even the original list of vendors that has been before the court for upwards of a month is not approved.   Weil says that the court might approve the order today, but we just have to wait and see. Once the court issues the order, the vendors still must complete a form of affidavit to submit to the court to complete the process. We have not yet been given the form of affidavit.

I attach the following:

1.  original list of vendors that is before the court for approval (doc ""58#s02!.doc"")

2. the current supplement list of proposed vendors, which has not been submitted to the court so far as I know, but which has been approved by the internal bankruptcy management committee for submission to the court (doc ""supplement matrix 020702 marked.doc"")

3. a grid for you to complete and send back to to me if you want to get additional law firms or other professionals (engineers, accountants, appraisers, other professional persons) approved, or if you want to send additional assignments to an OCP on the existing lists, as the OCP's apparently get approved for specific limited scopes. The criteria so far on for OCP's, subject to whatever the aproved order will say, is that the OCP is limited to a monthly budgte of $50k over an average of 6 months, and no more than $500k per case.  If you  think your budget will exceed that, then we need to talk. Depending on what Weil says, I would think the work should either be given to an existing specially retained profession or, if they can't handle the job due to expertise issues, perhaps another specially retained professional filing will nbeed to ne made. 

In addition to filing out the grid, the bankruptcy management committee will require that you be able to state thenew OCP you propose is not a related party (Enron and affilaited persons/parties do not have ecomonic interests in the proposed OCP, and vice versa). You should do that in your e-mail transmitting the completed grid back to me. (doc ""OCP supplement addition grid.doc"")

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

Well, you never know...
Got back into the office today after taking two days off with Sheila and
family in Fredricksburg to find a thick envelope from Mertz Ranch Company
buried in my ""in box"". Did not know what to expect, had visions of Mertz
mailing it back with a note saying forget it.
Instead, the lease was signed and dated and had a nice note saying ""thanks"".

Go figure.

We've got a lease for four more years. Same deal, same contract as the last
three years, just 6K more a year. Price remains the same this year. next
year it is 2k a year per spot and we will need to add one spot. Still
waiting on Chet. Would like to know who McCombs would suggest if Chet does
not commit. Lease requires Mertz to spent 2k a year on protien feed. He and
I can agree in writing to reduce or increase that amount with a
corresponding reduction or increase in lease cost. Term is April 1, 2002 to
April 1 2005; exclusive right to hunt turkey and deer, spring turkey
starting the third weekend in april.

I'm pleased. Hope you are, too.

Erik.

"Performance Process for All Employees in Debtor Companies","
Many of you have asked about procedures to evaluate employee performance.  We are finalizing a performance process designed to track and provide feedback on individual accomplishments for the benefit of each employee, the company and the unsecured creditors' committee.  A very simple and straight-forward online performance assessment system (PAS) will allow us to automate parts of the process.  

PAS will open next week on Monday, May 13, and remain open through Friday, May 24, 2002.  As an employee of a debtor company, you should access the system and complete your self assessment by Friday, May 17, 2002.  Your supervisor will review and approve submitted accomplishments and schedule a face-to-face meeting to discuss your contributions, offer feedback, set priorities for the upcoming period, discuss challenges and potential development opportunities, and if applicable, confirm your quarterly retention payout and project a target for the upcoming quarter.  

PAS will be accessible through the HR Global Launch Zone.  We'll send a reminder with more details next week.  In the meantime, if you have questions about the process you can contact your HR Representative.

"RE: Retail Gas Book / Business","Gentlemen,

	Here is some information I have prepared with Scott Mills help to summarize the EES retail positions. Call me or Scott if you have any questions. We're are still reviewing the positions and the related contracts but this is a good estimate of the ""keeper"" customers and market's positions.

To all,
I have asked Louis DiCarlo and Joe Parks to contact you to arrange to meet today to review the positions in the wholesale and retail gas books.

Greg/Pat, please pull the current positions (like you have done before) but for each month from the live, ITM counterparties

Scott/Dave/Jess, please do same for the portion of the retail gas book that is designated for retention (not the OTM positions or positions that have or will be rejected and terminated).  If necessary, consider setting up a separate book for the OTM positions.  Also, if you are not currently doing so, please start marking all retail curves at the locations that we have positions.  

Please forward the position information to Louis, Joe and Elena Chilkina as soon as possible, but no later than 12:00 Noon today.  If you have issues, please let me know.  Otherwise, I want to meet with all of you at 4:00 PM today in ECN 4105 to review the positions and discuss issues.

Thanks,
Ed

Subject: Dominion gas supply Tallahassee deal on Florida

Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

"Retention & Severance Plan","
To:  All US Domestic Employees
From:  Office of the Chief Executive

Earlier this week, we reached final resolution with the Creditors' Committee on a comprehensive retention and severance plan for employees of debtor companies, or those parts of Enron in bankruptcy.  Later this morning, we will file the plan with the bankruptcy court.  It will be public and posted on the court's website, but we have posted the plan on <http://home.enron.com>.  (See link below).  Other creditors and interested parties are allowed to review and comment on the plan.  After that, the court may approve or modify it.  We have asked the court to expedite a hearing date to consider the plan and we anticipate a hearing will be scheduled as early as the middle of April.

We want you to know that this plan is the result of much negotiation and compromise between Enron and our Creditors' Committee.  To be viable for approval by the bankruptcy court, a plan has to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors.  This plan meets that criterion.

We know all of you are interested in the plan's details so you can have some degree of financial certainty and make educated decisions for your future.  To help you fully understand how the retention and severance plan will work, we should first explain some near-term restructuring goals.

As we work to secure the most value for our creditors and other stakeholders, restructuring requires us to determine which assets or businesses provide greater value by being sold, as well as which assets or businesses provide greater value by generating ongoing cash flows.  We do have businesses and assets that are capable of emerging from bankruptcy.  We intend to separate those businesses from the liabilities and litigation facing the estate so they can succeed as part of a viable reorganized entity.

This will require us to identify employees best suited to liquidate non-core assets or wind down the estate, as well as employees best suited to support an emerging business.  Given the inherent uncertainty of restructuring, the retention and severance plan offers some measure of financial assurance to all employees of debtor companies regardless of their role within the organization.

The proposed plan is retroactive to March 1, 2002, and has a maximum value up to $130 million depending on the value of asset sales and other cash collections.  It includes the following components:
Severance benefits valued up to $7 million,
Retention payments valued at $40 million, and
Liquidation incentive pool, which is a variable pool tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate, with a minimum value of $7.4 million and a maximum value of up to $90 million, one percent of the estate's cash collection target of $9 billion.

SEVERANCE BENEFITS
A primary component of the proposed retention and severance plan is a new severance program for employees of debtor companies not currently participating in another plan.  Under the proposed plan, employees will be eligible for two weeks base pay for every full or partial year of service, with a maximum of eight weeks base pay and a minimum of $4,500.  If an employee resigns voluntarily or is terminated for cause, he or she is not eligible for severance benefits.

Some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute separate severance plans for their employees.  This was possible because their plans do not require the approval of the bankruptcy court.  The details of those plans have been shared with employees of non-debtor companies.

RETENTION
Under the proposed plan, retention payments will be made to many employees in debtor companies whose skills or knowledge are required indefinitely, or for a predetermined duration of the restructuring.  Regrettably, not all employees will receive retention.

An eligible employee's retention will be a percentage of his or her quarterly base salary.  At the beginning of each quarter, or three-month period, eligible employees will be informed of their projected range of retention compensation for the period by their supervisors.  The actual quarterly payout an employee earns will be decided at the end of the quarter based on performance and achievements during the period.

An employee participating in the retention program will receive 25 percent of the earned quarterly retention at the end of each period, with payouts as soon as practical after May 31, August 31, November 30, 2002, and February 28, 2003.  The remaining 75 percent of the earned retention for a period is non-vested, deferred, and will be paid to an employee after February 28, 2003.

If involuntarily terminated without cause prior to February 28, 2003, an employee will receive all deferred retention, plus retention based on the actual earned salary for the quarter in which he or she is terminated.  Employees' earned and deferred retention payments are considered post-petition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate.

An employee involuntarily terminated without cause is eligible for the greater of severance benefits or earned retention, with the total amount of retention payments received offsetting the amount of severance received.  Depending on an employee's personal circumstances, a participant in the retention program may wish to consider setting aside some portion of retention as a financial safety net in the event he or she is involuntarily terminated.

If an employee receiving retention voluntarily resigns prior to February 28, 2003, or is terminated for cause, he or she does not earn a retention payment for that quarter and forfeits all deferred retention.  He or she would not be eligible for severance.

Any amounts not paid out are returned to the retention fund and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program.

LIQUIDATION INCENTIVE POOL
Under the proposed plan, employees identified as critical to the sale of non-core assets and businesses will be eligible to participate in the liquidation incentive pool (LIP).  The amount of money in the pool will be directly tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate.

Enron's management committee will have discretion to assign incentive payments to participants in the liquidation pool after each $500 million dollars is collected, also called a ""collection milestone"".  Fifty percent of an employee's earned liquidation incentive for a collection period will be distributed at the time a milestone is reached.  The remaining 50 percent of the earned liquidation incentive is non-vested and deferred.

If a collection milestone is not reached in a given quarter, but progress has been made, a quarterly advance may be allocated among participants of the program based on a quarterly floor amount of $1.85 million.  Fifty percent of an employee's quarterly advance will be paid as soon as practical after May 31, August 31, November 30, 2002, and February 28, 2003.  The remaining 50 percent of an earned advance will be non-vested and deferred, and will offset against future incentive payments.

All accrued and deferred liquidation will be paid at the earlier of the following events:
1.		Enron's reorganization is complete; or
2.	the employee is involuntarily terminated without cause, or
3.	upon specified dates related to incremental cash collections.

Employees' earned and deferred liquidation incentives are considered post-petition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate.

Employees participating in the liquidation incentive pool are not eligible for severance benefits.  If an employee receiving liquidation incentives voluntarily resigns prior to February 28, 2003, or is terminated for cause, he or she will forfeit any deferred liquidation incentive payment and any minimum liquidation payment for the quarter in which he or she resigns.

Any amounts not paid out are returned to the liquidation incentive pool and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program.

OTHER ITEMS
Bankruptcy law allows creditors to claim as fraudulent any significant payments made by a company in the 90-day period prior to its bankruptcy's filing.  To that end, creditors may attempt to reclaim retention payments made prior to Enron's bankruptcy filing that they perceive were inappropriate or have not returned adequate value to the estate.  The Creditors' Committee has agreed to forego its right to pursue claims against any current employee who agrees to release claims against the company, and stays with the company through August 31, 2002, or until he or she is involuntarily terminated without cause, whichever comes first.

All debtor company employees will be required to sign a general release to receive their final severance benefits, deferred quarterly retention payments, or deferred liquidation payments.

We know how long you have waited for details about this plan.  We will instruct supervisors to begin communicating projected participation to each individual employee next week.  Although the Creditors' Committee has approved it, this proposed plan is not final until approved by the bankruptcy court.  Therefore, it is possible an employee's status could change depending on the final plan approved by the court.  Supervisors will hold follow up meetings with each employee to confirm his or her individual participation after the bankruptcy court rules on the plan.

Ed, here is the document which will be forwarded to Kay Mann for approval routing.

 << File: TerminationDASH.doc >> 

Joe Parks and I talked with Rick Miles at Entex this afternoon.  He agreed to all terms.  We are waiting for them to reply with final concurrence on the $2.05 price/dth for the storage inventory.  

I stated that the early termination is subject to bankruptcy court approval.  That didn't bother Rick too much.  He acknowledged that Entex commercial-side needed their attorney's sign-off as well (but didn't think there would be an issue).

Gentlemen,
 
 
            Please access www.mertzranch.com <http://www.mertzranch.com/> and witness my photographic skills and Joe's obvious hunting skills as a picture of Joe's 9 point is being proudly displayed on Michael's web-site!!!! Methinks using Joe's deer and my photographical skills as a shameless plug for Michaels ever expanding  Outfitting Monopoly?.should grant us (hunter and photographer) certain royalties normally associated with this sort of unlicensed usage of this form of media. Basically, we need a price break for use of picture!!!! Anyway, pretty cool seeing your very own photo displayed on a website!!!!

"Enron Center Garage","The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the 777 Clay garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these spaces.

Ed, this gas was nominated on an IT contract into a pool on NGPL.  I am unable to identify the gas after that so its difficult for me to tell if the estate benefited.  Let me know what you want to do at this point.

Assuming all of what is below is all correct, it appears that TDC is
entitled to payment.  The question with administrative priority is whether
the the estate benefitted.  If we took the gas, I assume that we did.
THanks.

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice
President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the
courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and
expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday
afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell
him.  This was an ENA deal.

>     Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00
from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001
(sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would ""file a claim for
administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all
other necessary relief against ENA"" if ENA did not remit payment by the
close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it
appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.

payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?

Sorry, but once again Tim has discovered a bug in the conversion of the Truequote data and has requested us to remain out of the files while they correct the program and rerun the job.  This should be complete by 1, at which time I will spot check the data and give the ok as to whether we can use the files.  In the meantime, if you could please try to update the progress reports with any data that you may have completed, it will be greatly appreciated.

"RE: Letter re Unpaid Invoice for Post petition Deliveries","
Assuming all of what is below is all correct, it appears that TDC is
entitled to payment.  The question with administrative priority is whether
the the estate benefitted.  If we took the gas, I assume that we did.
THanks.

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice
President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the
courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and
expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday
afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell
him.  This was an ENA deal.

>     Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00
from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001
(sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would ""file a claim for
administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all
other necessary relief against ENA"" if ENA did not remit payment by the
close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it
appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.

"RE: Hello","Great to hear from you!  We've been ragging on you all week for not giving us a call!  Things are start to move a bit more.  It looks like they are getting ready to auction some live contracts and I have my first meeting regarding settling terminated contracts this afternoon.  We haven't heard about retentions, but it should be any day now since I've heard that some people in risk were told this morning.  

Troy wants to know what your title is, so give him a holler when you get the chance.  We have also been wondering why your Instant Messenger always says that you are away.  You need to get that fixed.  

Thanks for the phone number and we'll definitely keep in touch!

"Memos Discussing California Market","By now you have probably heard about three memos that discuss questionable trading strategies at Enron involving the California market. The memos were brought to the Board's attention several days ago, and the Board voted on Sunday to waive the attorney-client privilege with respect to those documents. On Monday, we turned the memos over to the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission and other appropriate agencies. There are likely to be a number of investigations into this issue, and as we have with all current investigations, we will cooperate fully with these efforts. If you should be contacted in regard to this matter, I encourage you to contact Bob Williams in our legal group at 713-345-2402. However, while these investigations continue to look into the past, our focus must be on the future and on moving this company forward. 
Thanks for your continued efforts,

Friends:

The NYMEX issued the following notice regarding the EIA report that is scheduled

BNP Paribas Commodity Futures



Notice No.  02-129
Date:  May 8, 2002

To:     All NYMEX  Division Members

From:J. Robert Collins, Jr.,  President

Re:      EIA Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report and Explanation of  Survey
Methods Compared to AGA Natural Gas Storage Survey


On May 9 at 10:30 a.m. EDT, the Energy Information  Administration (EIA) will
release its first weekly natural gas storage report.  Prior to this, the
American Gas Association (AGA) provided weekly natural gas  storage estimates.
At 4:00 p.m. EDT today, EIA will release a paper which will  compare AGA and EIA
survey methods and include estimates of natural gas storage  for the weeks
between March 15 and April 26, 2002. Additionally, EIA will  release a file
containing weekly natural gas stocks from 1994 through April 19,  2002 that will
be used for historical comparisons included in the EIA Weekly  Gas Storage
Report. A description of the methodology used to develop these  estimates will
also be included in the file. The paper and file can be accessed  at
www.eia.doe.gov/oilgas/other/natwhatsnew.html.

"Karnes City","Men:
Sending Emrick and Elaine checks and contract for 2001 today. John is
re-upping with Mark and Matt for the dove/deer stuff and sent me a check for
their 2,600 payable to Rancho Grande trust. I have cut a check for 900 for
the dove lease people at 150 a piece bringing our total lease price to
3,500.
I'm assuming Emrick will sign the lease and cash the checks as he does every
june.
Dove boys can cut their checks for 150 to me and mail or hand deliver.
thanks, e.

"PPEP - Williams Gas Supply Issues","I spoke with Rick Vicens at PPE about the gas scheduling problem we're running into as a result of JP Morgan's delay in getting back to us on the L/C amendment/agreement (I have two calls into Rob Traband) as well as the new issue that we're currently investigating with respect to the Williams gas supply invoice due in November.  In light of the fact that nominations are due tomorrow and it is unlikely that the L/C amendment/agreement will be complete (let alone the L/C itself), Rick Vicens agrees that PPEP should prepay April gas so as to buy time to get the L/C in place.  Mike/Joe, please work together with Williams to determine the amount of the payment and coordinate with Theresa/Karen to get the wire out.

With resepect to the Williams gas supply invoice due in November, Rick Vicens agrees that if we do conclude that PPEP paid ENA and ENA did not forward funds to Williams, PPEP will need to make the supplier whole (like it did Lone Star).  He'd like to hold off on making the payment until we have all of the facts, provided that this doesn't interfere with our ability to flow gas to the plant as required.  Mike, you're in the best position to feel out Williams and advise us on this one.  Please try to get them to accept the prepay as a good faith effort to resolve the outstanding requests until we can finish investigating the payment history and lining up the L/C.  Let them know that if our investigation indicates that they've been shorted, the project is committed to making them whole and has the cash to do so.  Theresa/Karen, as you're setting up the wire on the April prepay please keep in mind that if Williams pushes back, we may need to increase the amount of the wire to make them whole for the amount due in November.

Margaret, please include in your review amounts paid to ENA by PPEP (part of the estimated payment shown in the spreadsheet you received yesterday) for supply costs incurred by PPEP under its agreement with Apache ($1,488,620).  We suspect that the fact pattern will be the same and wish to be prepared when the supplier starts to take us down that road.

Lisa, Chuck, Dan, Sylvia and John, this is being sent to you as an FYI.

Thanks,

RH

Check that, James paid $3,125,227.76 to ENA in November per the attached.
 
I spoke w/Margaret Dhont in Settlements who will look further into the amount that came into vs. what was was paid out by ENA in November relating to the Cleburne facility.  She should be getting back to us tomorrow morning.

[Margaret, for your reference, the asset goes by Tensaka IV, Cornhusker, Cleburne and Ponderosa Pine Energy internally.]

Subject:	RE: Outstanding Williams Invoice

James was making estimated payments each month for current month activity and the prior month's reconciliation to actual invoices.  To that end, he paid $3,715,582.50 for November 2001, the month the amount shown below was due, directly to ENA per the attached.  That's the same month the $108,405 Lone Star Invoice was due, which we know he had to remit to Lone Star after the bankruptcy (effectively ""double paying"" the invoice).  Since this didn't come up before he left, I think we can be reasonably certain that he didn't pay the amount shown to Williams.  The question is did Enron remit the payment to Williams?  Like you, I'm afraid to get the answer.  Is there a way to determine if we have a similar problem on Apache???

I think I found another unpaid invoice. Trey Skelton called me and said according to their records, this invoice has not been paid. This is not good. Theresa Vos is out today and Karen Herrmann is diligently looking to see if this was paid directly to Enron. Like it would matter anyway...

I've scoured the bank statements for Tenaska and Ponderosa Pine and don't see where this amount was ever paid.  We do have the invoice, though.

Theresa or Karen:

Can you look into this invoice for Williams:

	Williams Energy
	Gas for Ponderosa Pine Energy
	$2,226,962.50
	Due Date:	November 26, 2001
	October 2001 - Gas Deliveries?

A FED ID number is really what I'm looking for.

Thanks,

"Internet E-mail","
In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

"RE: Letter re Unpaid Invoice for Post petition Deliveries","If is was an ENA deal, the Dec. 3 is correct post-petition date.

I don't have anything on my list from TDC.  Won't hurt to call them anyway.

Subject:	FW: Letter re Unpaid Invoice for Post petition Deliveries

Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 (sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would ""file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA"" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.  

Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?


Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

All I need to know is if ENA received the gas as stated, and if there are any extenuating circumstances which would keep us from paying.  Otherwise I believe we need to make payments in accordance with the terms of the deal.  I'll confirm.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"","Here are the details from my conversation with Lonestar...

They will not burn off large imbalances in the winter due to pressure constraints.

As for selling off some off the imbalance base load, they have no problem with base loading 5 or 10, as long as we are capable of purchasing gas from spot suppliers if a cold front comes through and the plant begins to burn full capacity.  They will ask us to get on rate if that happens, if Tenaska burns the full 44,500, then we need to be putting that into the pipe, it cannot come from our length.  

Looks like they want us to stay on rate with the plant.  From looking at the plant's burns to this point, I think it would be safe to base load 5, and try to sell more each day to stay flat with the plant.  For the rest of January, you can try and sell some of that gas on the spot market.  The purchaser would need to buy it directly at the supply point and transport it away themselves.  

Let me know what you all need from me.  I am about to get supply points for February.

"Frio River Weekend  August 8-11","Dear All:
Sheila and I spent a weekend on the Frio River in August last summer and 
really enjoyed it. The place we stayed was run down. We have upgraded this 
year. The place we have chosen has 100 plus acres and four new and neat 
cabins. 140 a night for three night minumum. we have rented one of the four 
cabins for the weekend August 8 (thursday) to 11 (sunday). The other 3 
cabins are available.

Go check out their web site at www.friobluffcabins.com

Anyone interested? Might be alot of fun if we booked up the place to cool 
off in August.
FYI lots of fun tubing and shooting whitewings with your finger gun while 
anticipating opening dove season around the corner.

"Draft of Centana Letter Agreement","Joe, Here's the Letter Agreement. Remember that the Letter Agreement was
drafted with February 28,2002 Purchase Date so we need a dollar figure
for the post-bankruptcy storage fees.  For now I have left it blank. Any
chance that Centana will accept the $308,000 fee due for 2/28 because
they were the ones dragging their feet on the deal?

Not defined yet, but they are building an asset based trading organization,
and I'm certain it would be trading related.
My concern is that the timing won't fit your needs.

Greg,

Dreyfus said they are interested in you but not for the lead role for this
situation. Since you have something that is close, you might not be
available when Dreyfus is ready.
Please keep me posted on your situation and thanks for your interest in my
search.

Randy,

Sounds interesting, I wonder if they have been in contact with Enron, or
anyone here. I would be interested, but within a week or so I may be
elsewhere, so let me know. If they can move quicky,I am not interested in
moving to Conn but have an interest in Houston.

Let me know, the type of person they are looking for fits well timing isnt
great but sounds like they have a bigger plan.


You can email me here or home.

Thanks

Greg,

Here is the basic information on Dreyfus. Tim Stuart is the President of
Louis Dreyfus Energy Services, which is primarily the liquids trading
business at present. (go to: http://www.louisdreyfus.com/, click ""energy"",
and ""petrochemicals"".
Here is the generic recruiting email I sent out:

I request your assistance in gathering names of candidates for an ENERGY
EXECUTIVE search.

My Client: An $18 billion GLOBAL COMMODITY TRADING organization.

The Opportunity: Through acquisitions and joint ventures, to BUILD AN ASSET
BASED ENERGY TRADING COMPANY with the objective of monetizing the
optionality around those assets.

The Candidate: A STRATEGIC VISIONARY, capable of building a value oriented
organization, and capitalizing upon financial and physical trade arbitrage
opportunities.

Bottom line is they want back in to the physical business and they are
looking for the lead person to do it. The preference is to base them in
Wilton, CT but they will also consider Houston.
Besides experience trading a ""physical gas book"", this person must have
strong entrepeurnial and strategic instincts. Which assets should they buy?
Why? Which joint venture relationships make sense and why? These issues
require someone with a big picture understanding and vision of the energy
industry and an understanding of how to evaluate and monetize the
optionality of assets.
Some people may be great traders, but they don't have the aggressiveness and
vision to direct the business side of this venture. Some people may have
strong ""asset"" background but they don't understand how to manage a trade
group to squeeze the most value from assets through sophisticated and
creative trading strategies. This position requires both.
I would like to put your resume in front of them. Your recent experience
trading around the Bridgeline system would be of interest.
Please let me know what you think?

Randy

   Thursday 2/21/02
   Raymond James Energy Daily Update

   FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY

   Energy Price Summary (Close Wednesday 2/20/02):
   Oil (WTI) - $20.29, down $0.59
   12-Month Oil Futures Strip - $20.63, down $0.52
   Natural Gas (HHUB) -$2.39, down $0.01
   12-Month Natural Gas Futures Strip - $2.75, unchanged
   1% Residual Oil (on a Mcf basis) - $2.55, up $0.03
   London Crude Oil - $20.20, up $0.34 (so far this morning)

   1) AGA reports in-line injection, gas prices surge show strength on cold
   weather forecast/short covering
      Last week, 112 Bcf was withdrawn from storage, compared to 81 Bcf
      last year and expectations for a 115-120 Bcf withdrawal.
      Total storage is now 1,944 Bcf, which is 960 above last year.
      This week's report showed 4-5 Bcf/d less gas available for storage
      relative to last year on a weather-adjusted basis.
      The near-month (March) futures contract showed some strength this
      week, after the National Weather Service (NWS) forecasted
      colder-than-normal weather in several key consuming regions during
      the next 2 weeks.  Additionally, short covering by traders probably
      added to the positive momentum.  The contract traded as high as
      $2.46/MMBtu this week, before slipping to $2.40/MMBtu after the AGA's
      report.
      To reach 1,500 Bcf of gas in storage by the end of the traditional
      withdrawal season, approximately 74 Bcf/week would have to be pulled
      from storage on average over the last six weeks.  This compares to
      approximately 56 Bcf/week withdrawn during the same period last year
      under normal temperatures.  As a result, of the NWS's forecast is
      accurate, we could still hit the 1,500 Bcf mark.  However, if weather
      remains 15-20% warmer than normal, the probability of withdrawing
      that much gas decreases substantially.
      Longer-term, we continue to believe that natural gas fundamentals
      will be a supply driven equation.  Based on fourth quarter production
      volumes reported so far, it appears that U.S. natural gas production
      will, in fact, show both sequential and year-to-year declines.
      Despite the potential for near-term weakness in prices, we remain
      bullish on the intermediate and longer-term fundamentals for natural
      gas.


   2) The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported that total petroleum
   inventories decreased 5.5 MMBbls to 673.6 MMBbls for the week ended
   February 15, 2002.

   ?       The consensus range called for a 0.7 MMBbl build to a 2.4 MMBbl
   build.  This is a bullish report for the oil market.  Total petroleum
   inventories are currently 73.5 MMBbls (~12%) above levels one year ago.

   ?       Crude oil inventories decreased 4.5 MMBbls to 316.2 MMBbls last
   week.  Crude oil inventories are 37.5 MMBbls above last year at this
   time.  Based on our current U.S. crude oil demand estimate, there are
   approximately 17 days of crude oil inventory.
      Motor gasoline inventories increased 0.6 MMBbl to 218.2 MMBbls last
      week.  Motor gasoline inventories are 13.0 MMBbls above last year at
      this time.

   ?       Distillate fuel inventories decreased 1.6 MMBbls to 139.2 MMBbls
   last week.  Distillate inventories are 23.0 MMBbls above last year at
   this time.

   ?       U.S. refinery operations were at a 88.5% utilization rate, which
   was 0.7% higher than last week's 87.8% rate.  Total Petroleum imports
   decreased to 10.4 MMBbls/day.
      Despite last week's larger than anticipated draw in total petroleum
      inventories, the slowdown in U.S. economic growth that was
      exacerbated by the September 11 terrorist attacks has continued to
      weigh on demand and contribute to inventory levels that remain well
      above our 5-year average.


   OILSERVICE

   3) BJ Services Announces Another Strategic Acquisition.
   ?       Yesterday, BJ Services (NYSE:BJS/$30.03/Strong Buy) announced
   that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with OSCA, Inc.
   (NASDAQ:OSCA/$27.65) for $28 per share (a 27% premium to the
   pre-announcement stock price).  This all-cash deal equates to a total
   purchase price of roughly $420 million and is expected to close by the
   end of the second calendar quarter.

   ?       OSCA provides a full array of completion-related products and
   services, including completion fluids, completion tools and completion
   services.  BJ should ultimately be able to leverage the incremental
   products, services and markets across its existing asset and customer
   base to yield significant pull-through revenue opportunities down the
   road.  While it appears that BJ paid a full price for OSCA, the
   combination makes a lot of strategic sense.

   ?       Following the announced acquisition, we are making slight
   modifications to our near-term estimates.  Specifically, we are shaving
   a nickel from our existing FY2002 estimate, bringing it down to $1.25
   per share.  This is primarily due to the closing of the acquisition
   without significant near-term cost savings or pull through benefits.  As
   management indicated on its conference call, it expects the deal to be
   accretive to the FY2003 consensus of $1.85 per share by $0.06 to $0.07
   per share.  Since we are already in print at $2.00, we are leaving our
   FY2003 estimates unchanged in order to be conservative.  Given the
   expected slight accretion to FY2003 earnings, combined with potential
   longer-term upside and an improving market outlook, we are maintaining
   our Strong Buy rating and 12-month target price of $37 per share.

   4) Tetra Technologies beats consensus by a penny and appears extremely
   undervalued relative to its peers!
      Following yesterday's acquisition of OSCA by BJ Services, it is even
      more clear now that Tetra Technologies (NYSE:TTI/$23.62/Strong Buy)
      is cheap.
      Specifically, OSCA was purchased for between 30-35x 2003 EPS, or
      12-14x 2003 EBITDA.
      If we apply those multiples to TTI, we come up with a value of $45 to
      $55 per share, as opposed to the current price of $23.62 per share.
      The TTI story is very similar to that of OSCA, only perhaps not as
      well known.
      Following OSCA's acquisition, there remains a chance that TTI could
      be taken out at some point in time (although we have no reason to
      believe it will be soon).
      Furthermore, TTI stands a chance of gaining business as a result of
      this transaction.
      Finally, the company reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.35 per share,
      a penny above consensus.  It will host a conference call today at
      10:30am ET.  The dial in number is 800-860-2442.

   5) Unit Corp. handily beats fourth quarter earnings expectations
   ?       Unit Corp. (NYSE:UNT/$12.60/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter
   earnings of $0.27 per share, compared to $0.43 per share in the fourth
   quarter of 2000.  This result was $0.04 ahead of the consensus estimate
   of $0.23 per share.

   ?       Revenues for the quarter came in at $49.3 million, down
   approximately 25% from last year and down 28% from the third quarter.
   Likewise, overall operating margins were down over 530 basis points
   year-to-year to about 50%, while they were also down a like amount on a
   sequential basis.

   ?       The strong quarterly results were largely a result of
   stronger-than-expected dayrates, utilization and margins during the
   quarter.  In fact, average dayrates were down by only about $800 to just
   under $10,200 per day.  Meanwhile, average realized oil and natural gas
   prices reflected the current softer commodity price environment with
   declines on a year-to-year basis of 41% for oil and 61% for gas.
   Production volumes also decreased from last year by 2% for oil and 15%
   for natural gas.

   ?       Despite the generally strong results, drilling activity has
   fallen dramatically over the past couple months.  This drop in overall
   rig activity has had a significant impact on Unit's utilization,
   dropping from a quarterly average of nearly 71% rigs in Q4 to the
   current run-rate of 60%, pulling dayrates down another 10-15% currently.

   ?       Due to declines in the near-term outlook for drilling and
   production, combined with Unit's current activity indicators (dayrates,
   utilization, production and commodity prices), we are adjusting our
   quarterly estimates but keeping our annual estimates.  Accordingly, we
   are maintaining our 2002 estimate of $0.80 per share and our 2003
   estimate of $1.40 per share.  Despite the lack of near-term visibility,
   the improving long-term outlook causes us to maintain our Strong Buy
   rating with a 12-month target price of $18 per share (based on a blended
   average of three valuation techniques).

   6) Conrad Reports Very Disappointing Quarterly Loss
      Conrad Industries (NASDAQ:CNRD/$4.10/Strong Buy) reported its fourth
      quarter of a loss of $0.02 per share, compared to a profit of $0.10
      per share in the fourth quarter of 2000.  This results missed the
      consensus estimate by $0.14 per share.
      Revenues for the quarter came in at $9.9 million, which was down 11%
      from this same quarter last year and down 23% from last quarter.  The
      gross margin for the quarter was 13.8%, which was down over 800 basis
      points from the year ago period and down almost 800 basis points
      sequentially.
      The backlog at quarter-end stood at $10.4 million, down 49% from the
      fourth quarter of 2000 but up 4% from last quarter.
      The Company blamed the poor quarterly performance on weakness in the
      economy and offshore oil and gas industry.
      The Company will host a conference call at 10:30am ET this morning.
      You may access the call by dialing 800-966-6502.  A replay will be
      available by dialing 800-677-6200 and using access code 2280.

   E&P

   7) AEC Beats 4Q Expectations, EnCana Merger On Track
      AEC (NYSE:AOG/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter 2001 EPS of C$0.55
      per share, which was ahead of our estimate of C$0.40 per share.
      AEC achieved record sales averaging 356,000 Boe/d, up 20% from 2000.
      Each of the three growth platforms - Canada, the U.S. Rockies and
      Ecuador - set new records.
      In 2001, AEC's established conventional reserves rose by 15% to
      nearly 6 Tcf of gas and more than 600 million Bbls of oil and natural
      gas liquids. The Company replaced 276% of 2001 conventional sales,
      with 89% of the reserve additions coming through the drill bit. The
      largest reserve additions were in the U.S. Rockies and northeast
      British Columbia.
      The merger with PanCanadian remains on track with shareholder's
      meetings scheduled for early April and closing expected shortly
      thereafter.
      Alberta Energy's merger with PanCanadian Energy to form EnCana will
      create the largest and fastest growing super independent producer in
      the industry with a C$27 billion enterprise value and visible
      production growth in excess of 14% annually for at least the next
      five years. The combined company will have a dominant position in
      North America with interests in western Canada, the U.S. Rockies,
      offshore Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as 23 million
      undeveloped acres along the Rocky Mountain Fairway from southern
      Colorado to Alaska.  EnCana will also have large international growth
      engines in Ecuador and the North Sea.
      Our target price of C$80 (US$52) is based on a 6.1x multiple of 2002
      cash flow, a valuation comparable to that of its super independent
      peers.  We reiterate our Strong Buy rating.

   8) Pure Posts Stronger Than Expected 4Q Results, Reduces Capital Budget
   for '02.
      Pure Resources (NYSE:PRS/$19.90/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of
      $0.00 per share, which was significantly higher than our estimate of
      a loss of ($0.17) and the consensus estimate of ($0.13).
      PRS's production during 4Q:01 totaled 390 Mmcfe/d, up 70% from the
      same period last year, including acquisitions made during 2001,  and
      up 85% for the full year.  However, the company lowered 2002 volume
      guidance from 12% growth to 9% growth based on a reduced capital
      spending program.  As a result, we have lowered our 2002 earnings
      estimate from $0.32 to $0.31 per share to reflect the reduced
      expectations.
      Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of $1.12
      and $6.30, respectively, based on 11% production growth from 2002 to
      2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl
      of oil.
      The Company replaced 385% of its production from all sources at a
      cost of $1.82/Mcfe, and increased its total reserves by 34% to 1,469
      Bcfe.
      We are maintaining our Strong Buy rating on shares of Pure.  Through
      experience, operational focus and the application of newer
      technology, Pure has the opportunity to create significant value in
      the ""mature"" Permian Basin.  Our target price of $24 is based on a
      5.3x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified by the
      Company's geographical focus and operating leverage in the Permian
      Basin.

   9) XTO 4Q Results In-Line With Expectations.
   ?       XTO Energy (NYSE:XTO/$17.10/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of
   $0.42, which was in-line with our estimate of $0.41 and consensus of
   $0.40.

   ?       XTO's production during 4Q:01 totaled 565 Mmcfe/d, up 20% from
   the same period last year and up 17% for the full year.

   ?       Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of
   $2.19 and $5.27, respectively, based on 12% production growth from 2002
   to 2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl
   of oil.

   ?       During the conference call, XTO mentioned that it may make an
   acquisition in lieu of a portion of its organic production growth
   through the drillbit.  More specifically, XTO may forego a portion of
   its East Texas drilling budget and use $100-150 million towards an
   acquisition.  Either way, XTO is expected to achieve its 17-20%
   production growth target.

   ?       XTO has a multi-year inventory of development opportunities in
   the low-F&D cost Arkoma and San Juan Basins, as well as the East Texas
   Freestone and Bossier Trends.  For an E&P company, XTO has a
   large/diverse asset base, substantial project inventory, and multiple
   productive zones in its core producing areas.  We are maintaining our
   Strong Buy rating on shares of XTO based on the company's ability to
   generate consistent double-digit production growth.  Our target price of
   $24 is based on a 6.5x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified
   by the company's consistent and visible growth.

   The natural gas non-commercial net SHORT position increased
   significantly to 6,151 from 1,056 contracts.  This large increase in the
   net short position was primarily due to the 20% increase in the
   non-commercial short position to 27,103 from 22,655 contracts the
   previous week.
   The natural gas commercial net short position decreased to 8,434 from
   14,947 contracts.  The cumulative natural gas net short position
   decreased to 14,585 from 16,003 contracts.
   The non-commercial crude net short position decreased significantly to
   214 from 12,742 contracts the previous week.  The large change in the
   non-commercial crude net long position was due to the 16% decrease in
   the non-commercial long and the 25% increase in the non-commercial short
   position.
   The commercial crude net position became net long for the first time
   since the week of 2/26/2002.  The cumulative crude oil net position also
   became net long.  The cumulative crude net position has not been net
   long since the week of 2/26/2002 as well.

"WorldCom Conferencing Training Announcement","As previously announced, Enron has chosen WorldCom Conferencing as its preferred conferencing service provider. WorldCom can help us achieve our cost-saving objectives in conferencing, but your involvement is required. 
To Make a Reservation for Your Next Conference: 
Call 800-475-5000 
Provide your authorization code: 6160358 
Reserve on-line by using the Online Reservation System at <<http://e-meetings.wcom.com/>>. You can also modify, change, or cancel your conference by using this convenient tool.
Audio Conferencing - Whether you need to collaborate, exchange information or give a presentation, WorldCom's multi-featured audio conferencing service can help ensure that you meet and exceed your daily business goals. One of the quickest and most cost-effective ways to place a conference call is through a product called Instant Meeting. 
Instant Meeting is designed for small staff meetings, spontaneous events such as crisis management or to pull teams together for rapid decision-making. Many people use Instant Meeting for regularly recurring business meetings that don't require the intervention of a conference coordinator. 
Why use Instant Meeting? 
It's available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. 
You will save the administrative time spent setting up a reservation and distributing call information. 
WorldCom provides the same dial-in number (toll or toll-free) and pass codes for all meetings. 
There is secure password access and added security of separate leader and participant pass codes. 
You pay only for usage on Instant Meeting accounts of fewer than 20 ports. Larger port subscriptions carry a monthly fee in addition to usage (up to 100 ports available). 
For more sophisticated reservations, you can also use these other service levels: 
1)	Premier Service - Designed for high-visibility meetings, focus groups, press conferences, investor relations calls, presentations to large groups, or other events that require a dedicated meeting manager to handle your call from start to finish. 
2)	Standard Service - Designed for meetings with medium-sized groups, such as trainings or project management meetings. 
3)	Unattended Service - Designed for small internal meetings, such as staff or team meetings. 
Other services available from WorldCom Conferencing: 
1)	Video Conferencing - Video Conferencing provides businesses with all the advantages of face-to-face interaction and saves money on travel expenses. 
2)	Net Conferencing - Net Conferencing takes your meetings to the Internet and enhances your audio-only calls by adding a visual element to your meetings. With this Internet-based service, you can bring people to an environment that allows them to share and review information. 
To help you learn more about WorldCom's services, a WorldCom Conferencing Field Specialist, Torri Rhodes, has arranged a training seminar. Please RSVP for this seminar by replying to torri.rhodes@wcom.com <mailto:torri.rhodes@wcom.com>.

ON-SITE TRAINING  DATE:                     Tuesday, May 14, 2002  TIME: 10:00 - 11:00 LOCATION: ECN5C2

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Is this a brokered transaction because I don't see any contracts for transport for that pipeline?  Also, is someone expecting for payment to be made as you referenced in your last statement.  We have not made any payments other than ones requested by Commercial and approved by the Cash Committee since Nov. 2001 production.

Trying to determine what to slate for the weekend.  What do you think about

If not fishing, I want to make a tee time somewhere.  Either way, I got to
get on the calendar to get the ol' lady off my back about what I'm doing.

Thoughts, interjections, libations, deliberations?

Chad, the time in the ""stall"" with you last night was REAL.  Thanks.

"FW: PPEP - Williams Gas Supply Issues","So that we're all on the same page, Mike was successful with Williams.  We have an invoice in hand for a $2,290,500 that covers the prepayment on April volumes.  This has bought us some time on the November payment and L/C issues.  At Rob Traband's request, information that JP Morgan needs to get comfortable with the L/C waiver amendment/agreement was sent over this afternoon (i.e., arbitration pleadings and ""default"" correspondence between PPEP and Brazos, all of which has already been provided to JP Morgan, New York).

Subject:	PPEP - Williams Gas Supply Issues

I spoke with Rick Vicens at PPE about the gas scheduling problem we're running into as a result of JP Morgan's delay in getting back to us on the L/C amendment/agreement (I have two calls into Rob Traband) as well as the new issue that we're currently investigating with respect to the Williams gas supply invoice due in November.  In light of the fact that nominations are due tomorrow and it is unlikely that the L/C amendment/agreement will be complete (let alone the L/C itself), Rick Vicens agrees that PPEP should prepay April gas so as to buy time to get the L/C in place.  Mike/Joe, please work together with Williams to determine the amount of the payment and coordinate with Theresa/Karen to get the wire out.

With resepect to the Williams gas supply invoice due in November, Rick Vicens agrees that if we do conclude that PPEP paid ENA and ENA did not forward funds to Williams, PPEP will need to make the supplier whole (like it did Lone Star).  He'd like to hold off on making the payment until we have all of the facts, provided that this doesn't interfere with our ability to flow gas to the plant as required.  Mike, you're in the best position to feel out Williams and advise us on this one.  Please try to get them to accept the prepay as a good faith effort to resolve the outstanding requests until we can finish investigating the payment history and lining up the L/C.  Let them know that if our investigation indicates that they've been shorted, the project is committed to making them whole and has the cash to do so.  Theresa/Karen, as you're setting up the wire on the April prepay please keep in mind that if Williams pushes back, we may need to increase the amount of the wire to make them whole for the amount due in November.

Margaret, please include in your review amounts paid to ENA by PPEP (part of the estimated payment shown in the spreadsheet you received yesterday) for supply costs incurred by PPEP under its agreement with Apache ($1,488,620).  We suspect that the fact pattern will be the same and wish to be prepared when the supplier starts to take us down that road.

Lisa, Chuck, Dan, Sylvia and John, this is being sent to you as an FYI.

Thanks,

RH

Check that, James paid $3,125,227.76 to ENA in November per the attached.
 
I spoke w/Margaret Dhont in Settlements who will look further into the amount that came into vs. what was was paid out by ENA in November relating to the Cleburne facility.  She should be getting back to us tomorrow morning.

[Margaret, for your reference, the asset goes by Tensaka IV, Cornhusker, Cleburne and Ponderosa Pine Energy internally.]

Subject:	RE: Outstanding Williams Invoice

James was making estimated payments each month for current month activity and the prior month's reconciliation to actual invoices.  To that end, he paid $3,715,582.50 for November 2001, the month the amount shown below was due, directly to ENA per the attached.  That's the same month the $108,405 Lone Star Invoice was due, which we know he had to remit to Lone Star after the bankruptcy (effectively ""double paying"" the invoice).  Since this didn't come up before he left, I think we can be reasonably certain that he didn't pay the amount shown to Williams.  The question is did Enron remit the payment to Williams?  Like you, I'm afraid to get the answer.  Is there a way to determine if we have a similar problem on Apache???

I think I found another unpaid invoice. Trey Skelton called me and said according to their records, this invoice has not been paid. This is not good. Theresa Vos is out today and Karen Herrmann is diligently looking to see if this was paid directly to Enron. Like it would matter anyway...

I've scoured the bank statements for Tenaska and Ponderosa Pine and don't see where this amount was ever paid.  We do have the invoice, though.

Theresa or Karen:

Can you look into this invoice for Williams:

	Williams Energy
	Gas for Ponderosa Pine Energy
	$2,226,962.50
	Due Date:	November 26, 2001
	October 2001 - Gas Deliveries?

A FED ID number is really what I'm looking for.

Thanks,

Mike

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.

If not fishing, I want to make a tee time somewhere.  Either way, I got to get on the calendar to get the ol' lady off my back about what I'm doing.

 

Thoughts, interjections, libations, deliberations?

No, I can set you up on the web this afternoon and we can call this next
week your free trial!

I'll send info to our web support right now. It should be up late this
afternoon or tomorrow morning.

Let's do this:

login: bridge
password: cajun

Please use all lower case, since it will be cap-sensitive.

I'll be out of the office tomorrow, but I'll have someone checking my e-mail
if you have any problems with the website.

The webmaster is Darren Prager (dprager@earthsat.com).

Thanks again!!

Matt

Matt,

The contract looks fine, my only question is do we have to wait till the
20th to get web access?  Just explain to me when we can begin receiving the
service.

Thanks again,

Greg Schockling

Greg,

Good afternoon. I'm attaching a contract agreement, which includes a
discount for the smaller number of users. Please let me know if you have any
questions or concerns regarding the contract.  Otherwise, please sign and
fax back to (301)231-5246 or 5020 at your earliest convenience.

Thanks again!

Greg,

Unfortunately not. That service is a hybrid that we offer to both our
clients and theirs. The cost for the service is $6600/year. You may want to
check with PIRA on your arrangement with them, but typically this is sold
separately.

I'll put a contract together for you with the basic, noon, and an applied
discount to account for your group's smaller size.

Thanks!

Matt

Matt,

Heres what I think we need here at Bridgeline, the basic service plus the
noon update, 1 page.  I also had a question, does this package include the
forecast on storage from pira?  We are a Pira client already so I just need
clarification on that.


Let me know then we'll finalize.

Thanks very much.

No problem. I'm attaching this morning's basic for you. If you want, we can
keep those products coming to you regularly this week as a free trial until
you've decided.

Greg,

Good morning. Enron was paying for a pretty large weather package from us,
so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package. Were there just certain
products you were using? For example, our basic package, which includes the
1-15 day maps, the 16-city forecasts, the 30-day outlook, and phone access
is $450/month. The noon update would be an additional $150/month. Since you
are a smaller group, I can apply a discount as well...perhaps as much as
20%. Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put
together a package and quote for you fairly quickly. I'm attaching our
standard price sheet for your reference as well.

Take care,

Matt,


My name is Greg Schockling and I work for Bridgeline Gas Marketing, a
parternship between Chevron/Texaco and Enron.  We previously received your
energy weather via Enron and effective the 5th we stopped receiving it.  I
was wondering what you wouyld charge for us to pick up the service.  Weare a
small shop of 5 traders, we operate a pipeline in Louisiana and want to
continue the service.


Can you quote me what the cost would be to continue the service.  My phone
nummber is 832-851-2806.


Thanks


Greg Schockling

"$ Disbursement Process"," 

Attached is an example of a Cash Payment Request.  Tweak it to your needs.

To get wire payments approved from a DIP account, you need to submit this CPR to the cash committee (Doug Sewell is our representative) along with an invoice, if available, and a Wire Transfer Request.

The WTR must be signed by Susan Helton.  

Finally, the amount of the disbursement must be communicated to Lindsay Long who prepares the 5 Day Forecast.  The cash committee will not consider your request until it is on the 5DF.

It's important to make sure the cash is actually distributed.  The money does not always go out as I've recently experienced.

"Naming the New Company","Since our OpCo proposal became public, some in the media and others have assumed Enron's new name will be OpCo.  That's a mistake -- OpCo is only a temporary name.  As I've said before, employees should have an opportunity to participate in naming a new company.  And now, here's your chance.

We are just beginning the process to name a corporation that would essentially be an energy asset holding company.  The individual assets within this proposed holding company would not adopt the new name, but continue to use their existing names -- Transwestern Pipeline, Northern Border Partners, Portland General Electric, Elektro, and others.  These names are familiar and reputible within their respective markets.

To submit a name or names for consideration, send an email with your ideas to me at Office of the Chief Executive anytime between now and the end of June.  Over the next few months, we'll be narrowing a list and making a selection.  We will announce the chosen name later in the year once we know the outcome of the OpCo auction process.

I hope you have fun with this and I look forward to seeing your ideas,
Steve Cooper

"FW: Retail Gas Book / Business","To all,
I have asked Louis DiCarlo and Joe Parks to contact you to arrange to meet today to review the positions in the wholesale and retail gas books.

Greg/Pat, please pull the current positions (like you have done before) but for each month from the live, ITM counterparties

Scott/Dave/Jess, please do same for the portion of the retail gas book that is designated for retention (not the OTM positions or positions that have or will be rejected and terminated).  If necessary, consider setting up a separate book for the OTM positions.  Also, if you are not currently doing so, please start marking all retail curves at the locations that we have positions.  

Please forward the position information to Louis, Joe and Elena Chilkina as soon as possible, but no later than 12:00 Noon today.  If you have issues, please let me know.  Otherwise, I want to meet with all of you at 4:00 PM today in ECN 4105 to review the positions and discuss issues.

Thanks,
Ed

"Good News, Lease Signed","Well, you never know...
Got back into the office today after taking two days off with Sheila and
family in Fredricksburg to find a thick envelope from Mertz Ranch Company
buried in my ""in box"". Did not know what to expect, had visions of Mertz
mailing it back with a note saying forget it.
Instead, the lease was signed and dated and had a nice note saying ""thanks"".

Go figure.

We've got a lease for four more years. Same deal, same contract as the last
three years, just 6K more a year. Price remains the same this year. next
year it is 2k a year per spot and we will need to add one spot. Still
waiting on Chet. Would like to know who McCombs would suggest if Chet does
not commit. Lease requires Mertz to spent 2k a year on protien feed. He and
I can agree in writing to reduce or increase that amount with a
corresponding reduction or increase in lease cost. Term is April 1, 2002 to
April 1 2005; exclusive right to hunt turkey and deer, spring turkey
starting the third weekend in april.

I'm pleased. Hope you are, too.

Erik.

"Monster US Trade Deficit, FX World June 20, 2002","Thought you would find this guy's FX write-up interesting today...

 

From: Michael F McGuinness on 06/20/2002 10:09 AM

 

 

Simple thoughts.....

 

US assets get sold... (mostly equities).... and then the USD is sold.....

 

It's not the other way around.

 

The world is losing confidence.  Everyday we get more terrorist activity around

the world. (sorry Reuters.... it's terrorism....)

 

 Uncertainty is higher...... Risk is higher...... People around the world want

their money close to home. So off they go to sell their investments here in the

States, sell the USD and buy their home currency.

 

US April trade deficit came in at $35.94 bln..... a record. Here's the part

that's amazing..... the trade imbalance in goods.... US deficit in goods

only.... $39.92 bln..... $40 bln goods imbalance in just one month....

 

And where are we importing from.....

 

China.... $7.55 bln and this is a natural phenomena since about any product

sold these days under $100 in the US these days is made in China......

compliments from Mark....  China has a competitive advantage, and trade rules

will dictate that goods will originate from China until the cost structure

adjusts...... say in 25 years......

 

Western Europe...... $7.244 bln..... yeah the standard of living in Europe must

be the same as China....... with higher short term rates in Europe..... growth

in many industries in Europe is from the US. How can anybody in Brussels think

that a trade surplus with the US almost equal to China's (and one that is

larger than Japan's...) is a proper economic condition.......   As I said on

Tuesday.... I believe that the purchasing power parity level for the EUR is up

over $1.0800. (this is based on some long term thoughts.... that the old DEM

for PPP was 1.80 against the USD....)

 

The EUR is undervalued by 12.5%. That's why I think it's funny that European

politicians and the press feel that the EUR is strong up here the .9500 - .9600

area.

 

If a few people in the Bush administration start thinking that the US trade

picture needs to change...... you may have heard the last utterance of anyone

saying they want a strong USD.......

 

The US current account deficit in Q1 2002 was $112.5 bln....  So the US has to

attract $37.50 bln per month to keep this in balance......   to do so either

asset prices need to go lower or the USD has to go lower......  both is

happening.....

 

Well, the US trade deficit is getting closer to 4.5%  of GDP.  Just the

deficit.... and just extrapolate that for the CA deficit.......

 

So the EUR just popped up over .9600 and a boatload of stops were just done

into the .9625-30.  And now will have settled in at .9610. There are no

retracements in the EUR, just quiet periods of consolidation.

 

Until we get a screaming need to own US equities..... there appears to be no

need to own USD, and no retracement of the EUR.

 

Japan's trade surplus with the US..... $6.8 bln.  The game continues.....

USD/YEN 123.50 and no Bank of Japan...... I think, it would not be in the best

interest for the Japanese to be seen intervening right after this monster of a

trade deficit.

 

Japan overnight announced that their May trade surplus rose 715% y/y.......

Anything that climbs over 700 % is not normal...... most of Japan's trade

surplus with the rest of Asia rose 626%......

 

But every month,  Japanese authorities will need to vacuum up about $7 bln USD

just to keep the YEN stable against the USD,  as the current imbalance in trade

creates pressures for a firmer YEN.......  Who knows, maybe  a few voices in

Asia could clamor....  that the YEN is too weak.....

 

Bank of Japan foreign reserves in USD is over $400 bln these days and climbing,

(I think $406 bln in April and $419 bln in May)........ Maybe Japan will

someday dollarize........

 

Canada's trade surplus with the world is up 11.0% to $5.2 bln. Automotive

exports... the key.  The CAD trade surplus with the US was $8.2 bln and a

deficit with the rest of the world at $3.0 bln. (The US commerce department has

the CAD surplus at $4.1 bln....)

 

SGD at 1.7775.... firmest level since last October. It's moving on it's own, no

sympathy move with the YEN.... so either the YEN has to play catch-up or the

YEN is going to weaken against the rest of Asia....

 

Thai baht is also firm at 42.00 against the USD.  Korean won still at 1210.

Asia definitely looks better with the US trade deficit.

 

Venezuelan bolivar a record low at 1305 to the USD, since May 1 the VEB has

devalued 52%.   Not much more to say.....

 

Everyone have a great day....... the above thoughts are for your reading

pleasure. Any questions call me. All the best.

I propose to add the following language to the Purchase Price paragraph
and otherwise both agreements are fine with me:
""The Purchase Price shall be paid to ENA by wire transfer of available
funds to the following account: Enron North America Corp., Citibank New
York, ABA 021 000 089, Acct# 40781075.""

In addition, the contact information for Lloyd Don Miller is

Mike, Please call me if you have any questions.

CIPCO is now an LLC so we have reflected it that way in the agreement.
We
also filled in information for the blanks.  Otherwise, everything looks
great.  Also, for your information, Brian S. Frederick, Vice President,

Subject: Recent Power Price Spike


An early heat wave in the Midwest, Mid Atlantic  and the Northeast has
caused electricity demand, power prices, spark spreads, and implied heat
rates to spike over the last few days in those regions as follows:

(Embedded image moved to file: pic31185.pcx)

Based on these spark spreads and implied heat rates, we suspect that the
increased electricity demand has likely caused a temporary increase in
electricity-driven gas demand (difficult to quantify, but likely to show up
in next week's gas storage numbers).  Implied heat rates and spark spreads
have been high enough to bring simple cycle peaking units as well as
combined cycle units into the market.  Furthermore, many lower marginal
cost coal and nuclear units are currently offline for traditional
maintenance, and the biggest beneficiary from a generation standpoint are
gas-fired units.
Temperatures in the Midwest are expected to drop today and Thursday along
the East Coast, so the spike should be short-lived and gas-fired
electricity production should come back down somewhat as a result (based on
power prices so far today, it already appears that prices are beginning to
come down).

"Allen Center Garage","
Central Parking is currently working on the gated access system of the Allen Center Garage to improve its operation.  Over the next four to six weeks, the existing system will be replaced with new, improved technology.  In the meantime, Enron Property Services is working with Central Parking to develop a short term solution to improve access in and out of the garage.

If you experience a problem entering or exiting the garage with your access card, call Martin Katz at extension 59322.  Indicate where the problem occurred (Gold, Green or Blue Garage), whether it was upon entering or exiting, and the time of day the malfunction occurred.  This will enable Property Services to help Central Parking pinpoint the problem areas that should be addressed first.

If you currently use a transponder for entering or exiting the Allen Center Garage, please contact the Parking & Transportation desk at extension 37060.  Arrangements will be made to immediately replace your transponder with a new access card.  The transponder system is experiencing the majority of problems and will be taken out of service in the future.

Chris and Kieth: Thought cam to me after I talked to you guys regarding
BOOGER motor. Chris, was that spincast the one with the bent up aluminum
housing on the inside??? If it is, that is the one that I sent to get
repaired. I have a feeling that it is not. I think it might be the motor
that was at the mesquite flat last year. If it is, that motor has a week
spin motor and occationally would get stuck by slight resistance from corn,
but the clock would still work fine. If that is the one that is now at
booger, pulling the guts and replacing it will do nothing. It is the spin
motor that needs to be replaced. If it is the one that is all muddy, it is
the one that was at gray box last year and got trashed by the coons at the
end of last year. It looked like it was working, but apparently is not.

Talk to each other and see if you can figure out which one it is.

Doing a count of feeders, I think there is still one Magnum black photo box
in the trailer and I know there are two green tubes. I think our best option
may be to put a magunum on booger with a conversion (free) and shelf the
spincast or confirm what is wrong with it before we dump more $ into another
one of those piece of shit motors.

Please advise on your thoughts. e.

"RE:","Joe - talked w/ Zisman about Centana this p.m.  He agrees that so long as the party ENA shorted is different from the counter party on the implied storage agreement, then they are on shaky ground....and run the risk of blowing up the entire deal.  My sense is that should they desire to hold in escrow additional amounts (without the estate agreement)  they are exercising set off rights w/ affiliated ownership under an implied storage lease agreement.  That is some seriously bad ju ju (translated...they better think again).

I am going to push for cash committee approval tomorrow or Thursday as discussed yesterday.  Shemin should have her revised doc this p.m. or tomorrow a.m.

They are moving both Power and Gas, so I am not sure what time the building will be open on Sunday or if it will be open at all.  I will get back to you with that information by Thursday.

Here is an answer for you vis a vis load growth.

Hope it helps,

Subject:	ERCOT load comparison

Please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from May 2000 and May 2001.  There are two tabs, one tab contains the days May 16-18, 2000 and the other tab contains the days May 14-18, 2001.  Each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question.  The days most directly comparable are May 17, 2001 (Thursday) and May 18, 2000 (Thursday), although the two days preceding May 18, 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding May 17, 2001.  The peak on 5/17/2001, 44,923 MW, is 2.78% higher than the peak on 5/18/2000, 43,709 MW.  With similarly warm days before 5/17/2001 as there were before 5/18/2000, the peak would obviously have been even higher.  This would put the year-over-year growth in excess of 3%.  I believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year-over-year from an earlier analysis, somewhere in the range of 3.5% to 4%.  

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

"Cell Phones, Pagers & Telephony Services","
Effective immediately Enron will begin moving all wireless devise accounts to individual employees for payment.  With all the changes currently taking place within Enron, this change will allow each user to experience uninterrupted service and keep communication flowing while at the same time allow the individual user greater accountability for these controllable expenses.  

Cell Phones and Pagers
Over the next few weeks Enron will be changing the employee payment method of cell phones and pagers, regardless of the vendor.  Optimum base rates and terms of service will be negotiated with pager and cell phone providers for the Houston area.  

All Cingular and non-Cingular accounts will be rolled under one agreement (see below for Nextel users).  (Field locations are excluded from this change and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as appropriate.)  For billing purposes, this action will require all cell phone users to have the device and service put in their name.  While the phone will be in the employee's name it will be backed by Enron, therefore a personal credit check will not be required and you will not be required to sign a contract.  This change will allow each user to verify their bill for accuracy and to ensure that the bill is paid on time.  

All monthly charges for cell phone and/or pagers are to be submitted for reimbursement via XMS.  Direct billing and/or group billings will be phased out over the next few weeks.  XMS training and class schedules will be forthcoming.  

Please follow the steps below to make the necessary changes to your account:
?	Contact your service provider and make arrangements to have your bill paid monthly either by credit card or personal check.  The Cingular contact is Charlotte McGowan, (972) 706-1968.  If you need information regarding contacts for other providers, please contact Darin Lee Carlisle @ Global Strategic Sourcing ext - 5-3808.  
?	Submit the expense item to your supervisor for reimbursement through XMS.
?	Do not sign a contract, as you will become personally liable for the account for the life of the contract.
?	Change the address on your bill to either your home address or your current office address to ensure timely receipt of the invoice in the future.

Nextel Phone/Two-Way Radios
We are currently working with Nextel to restructure billing to individual employees.  All monthly charges for Nextel services will be submitted for reimbursement via XMS.  Pre-approval by Business Unit CAO will be required for all Nextel phone/two-way radios.

Long Distance
An individual code will be assigned to each Houston based employee for use when dialing long distance calls.  These codes will create individual accounts for each employee so that they can identify their long distance usage and reimburse the company for personal calls they may make. (Field locations are excluded at this time.)  

Conferencing
WorldCom will provide all audio conferencing services.  Monthly conferencing charges will be reviewed and approved by Department heads.  Training will follow under separate cover.

Training / Questions
Training sessions and additional communications regarding these changes will follow in the next few days.  Please contact Darin Carlisle at (713) 345-3808 or Peter Goebel at (713) 345-3325 with any questions regarding the above changes.  Questions regarding XMS training should be directed to Tammy Hopkins at (713) 345-3631.

The joy of going to college in Texas....
UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS I live in a town where you stand out if you don't have a
purple Mohawk, facial piercing chained to nipple piercing, a homosexual
lover, or hang out at the Magnolia Cafe. More people go to my school than
live in Australia. I honestly believe that Ricky Williams is a god. I am
open-minded and spiritually in tune - except towards people who are
closed-minded and spiritually out of tune. You can see my dorm from Chicago
for it is as tall as Florida would be if it stood up. I protest everything
-except protests. I am a gold card carrying member of Amnesty International.
I am openly bi-curious. I am a Longhorn.

TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY I live in a town the size of a piece of
bacteria on a fly's ass. I spend Friday nights practicing my yells. 
I can whoop better than anyone can in my battalion. I beat up faggots for
fun. If
I'm not yelling, drinking with my battalion, or beating up faggots 
for fun, I am at the Dixie Chicken. My father went to school here, just as
his father
did before him, and his father before him. My brother went to tu. They never
found his body after he came home that first Christmas in college. I won't
walk on the grass. I look forward to the day I, too, will do the elephant
walk. I believe it is cool to do something because they tell me it is
tradition. If something is not a tradition and we accidentally do it, we
then make it one. I can call UT ""tu"" if I want. I am an Aggie. BAYLOR
UNIVERSITY I live by homeless vagrants, whom I turn my
nose up I look just like everyone else at my school. The NoZe Brothers are
the coolest things since khakis and sandals. I have an Abercrombie and Fitch
everything. I can co-ordinate outfits and ensembles better than anyone in my
upscale apartment complex. I have radar that lets me know where the closest
ATM is. If I can't find one it's okay. I have ten credit cards all of which
to my parents. My town is so conservative that anyone who kisses on the
mouth
before three years of marriage is drug through the town. I like me. I should
be an underwear model. I am a Bear.

TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY I live on a piece of dirt so flat that we call the
four degree incline at the intersection of 19th and Brownfield the big hill.
I get dirt in my eyes, hair, and teeth when I walk to class. I can out drink
anyone from any other school because that is what we do. If I'm not drunk by
4:30pm, I'm high. I can't buy beer within 50 miles of where I>live - so I
trek to the strip, which my friends and I
all consider a true paradise on Earth. I don't go to many football games. I
don't go to any organizational meetings. I don't really go to anything. Not
even class. I like the fact that Will Rogers' horse's ass points to College
Station. I fry cow balls. I know where Buddy Holly used to live. I am
desperately trying to find a rival within our conference to make fun of. Our
football players get caught by the NCAA. If I'm not drunk by 4:30pm, I'm
high. But I'm usually drunk by 4:30pm. Or I'm high. I am 
a Red Raider.

THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS (UNT) I am either a film geek or a musician.
If I am neither then you will find me hanging out on Fry Street dressed in
my punk garb. I think my school sucks yet I still attend school here. I wear
t-shirts and hats from either A&M or UT because I wish I could've gotten in
there. On Thursdays you will find me shaking my thang at the Groovey Mule or
down in Deep Ellum. I think Denton is the scuzziest town ever and I bitch
about all the pot holes in the roads when I am driving anywhere in the city.
Most of the people here are weird. Noone
stays on the weekends. Noone has ever even heard of my school. On Sundays,
the whole town goes to church at Denton Bible. Damn, I really wish I
could've gotten into one of the other Texas colleges. I am a mean green
Eagle. Cawwww!
TEXAS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY (TCU) I am in a frat or sorority of course. I
drive a Lexus or Mercedes, and if I pass all my classes then Daddy said he
would buy me that little condo on Hulen next semester. I wear my diamonds
and heels for football games and get dressed for bed and  THEN go to the
basketball games. Anyone and everyone goes to the Pub or Scooners, or to
Longhorns and dance with old Mexican cowboys. We are having a J.Crew built
in the bookstore next year and our send home credit cards apply at ALL times
and locations. Where the girls' hair is as fake as their tans. The freshman
15 means nothing more to me than a new wardrobe. Where the girl to guy ratio
is four to one and the only one getting any action is the rapist. Where the
girls are girls, and so are the guys. I'm a Frog.

SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY (SMU) See the listing for Texas Christian
University above...change 'Hulen' to 'Mockingbird'. I'm aMustang.

SFA STATE UNIVERSITY I am drunk or having sex right now. I went to class
once. That about sums it up. I am a Lumberjack.

THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON I work all day or all night. I attend school
part-time. I'm trying to get a degree, any degree, to help get a decent job.
I live with my parents, and spend as little time on campus as possible.
Football games?? You mean we have a football team??? When say my school is
in an urban setting, I'm serious. In the shadows of the fourth largest city
in the U.S., right in one of the most crime-ridden areas I go to school. I
wish I could go to A&M, or any other big school and get a real degree. I
wish I hadn't flunked out when I was attending a real
school. I'm a Cougar.

SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITY (SWT) I tried to get into a real school,
but couldn't. I spend most weekends tubing down the river in New Braunsfels
drunk and/or high and naked, or getting drunk and acting stupid. I'm a
Bobcat.

SAM HOUSTON STATE UNIVERSITY (SHSU) I am a big time band nerd.
My favorite hobby is playing with my instrument. There are no attractive
people at my school because we're all band geeks. At night, my flute is my
best friend. I'm studying music so that I can become a licensed band geek
leader and warp the minds of future generations. What the hell is a Bearkat,
anyway?

TARLETON STATE UNIVERSITY I am a roper (""kicker""). My life revolves around
bovines and sheep, and I like studying ""animal husbandry"", if you know what
I mean. I either wear Wranglers that cut the circulation off to my unit, or
Rockies that give me a major camel toe. I have a belt buckle the size of a
dinner plate. My favorite beer is Coors Lite. I have a gun rack in the back
of my pickup, which is a diesel with dual wheels. I am a Texan.

EAST TEXAS STATE Who cares? Does anybody go there? Isn't that
like a community college?

"All-Employee Meeting - Thursday, April 11, 8:30 a.m. (CST)","As Steve Cooper has mentioned in his voicemail messages, there will be an All-Employee Meeting this Thursday, April 11.  The meeting will be held at 8:30 a.m. (CST) in the Imperial Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  Unfortunately, the full ballroom was not available until late May, but we did not want to put off the meeting until then.
Capacity at the Hyatt will be limited to 1,400 people seated, with additional room for approximately 200 people standing.  As an alternative to attending the meeting, employees in Houston will be able to listen to a live audio stream and view the slide presentation on their computers at http://home.enron.com/employeemeeting/.  The question and answer portion of the meeting will not be broadcasted.  Shortly after the meeting, the audio broadcast and the slide presentation will be available for all employees at home.enron.com.
Given the current environment and continuing media interest surrounding Enron, we will take extra security precautions at the Hyatt.  Employees attending the meeting will be required to show their current photo employee badge and each badge will be crosschecked with a current employee list.  No one will be permitted into the meeting without their badge.  Due to space constraints, contract workers will not be permitted to attend the meeting.  We recognize that this security process will take time, so check-in will begin at 7:45 a.m. We apologize for any inconvenience this process creates and appreciate your understanding and patience.
We encourage you to submit questions for the meeting in advance.  Please send them via email to ""Office of the Chief Executive"".

My thoughts are as follows:

1)  Generally looks good
2)  What about Governing Law?
3)  What about a provision that makes it clear that Buyer cannot offset
this payable against any other amounts that may be owed to Duke or its
affiliates
4)  In the as-is section - my guess is that they will object to the
absence
of some title rep.  I am ok to provide a special warranty as to title to
the gas but not other reps

Please revise accordingly ASAP and forward to Duke for their
consideration.
Shemin - Joe can provide you with an email address for the commercial
contact and my guess is that you have the necessary contact info for
Duke's
counsel.

Joe - do we know what bank we are going to use.  Shemin - what about the
draft of escrow agreement?

   Here is the revised draft. I spoke with the Duke attorney and he is
   taking ""let me see it and I'll let you know"" approach so let me know
if
   you have any additional changes and I will send it over to him.

   Also, it is my understanding that we must now have a Weil Gotschal

   so I am trying to find out who that person is and what needs to be
done.

The risk of loss in trading commodities can be substantial.  You should
therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in
light of your financial condition.  Information contained in this report is
not to be considered as an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy
commodities, nor do we make guarantees.  Kase will not be responsible for
any typographical errors.  Expressions of opinion are subject to change
without notice.

Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of
which are described below. No representation is being made that any account
will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.  In
fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical
performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any
particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical
performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of
hindsight.

In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no
hypothetical trading  record can completely account for the impact of
financial risk in actual trading.  For example, the abilities to withstand
losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading
losses are material points that can also adversely affect actual trading
results.  There are numerous other factors related to the markets in
general or to the implementation of any specific trading program that
cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical
performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading
results.

You have any suggestions as to which point(s) we could use as a primary curve?  Two would be helpful for each

Subject:	Broadcast Message - Trading Floor Stentofons
Importance:	High

With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Fish products(incl. eye): Yummy
Red fish dip: agreed on the thick V-8, of course we gringos have always been accused of over-doing Mex. fair, hence Tex-Mex, Pappasitos has made millions over doing Mex food.
Beer(XX): abundant
Service: attentive!! ""Uno mas Cervesa por favor senorita!""  ..and she did.
The others:  perfect entertainment despite the ""partner's"" everpresent nervous grimace.

Glad to see Chompers out!  I say lets invite one other individual every time that we can disturb--kinda like a deer lease interview.

All in all, good venture, I think I have put most of the fish back in the water by now.

Subject: RE: RESULTS OF MAN NIGHT

Ok...I thought the addition of ""life partners"" to the table simply intensified the revelry normally associated with ""Man Night""...                 it was like the testosterone crescendoed to its normal Deer-lease range once the ""other side"" joined our fray. Up until that point, I thought everyone's mini-meetings regarding isolated work-related gibberish was very non Man-like, almost to the point of boredom. Thank God ""They"" arrived b/c they brought out the best in the ""Men"".

It was either that or the $190.00 worth of alcoholic beverages that did it.

RE: The food...

Salsa was uninspired...but had good bite.
Queso is queso when doctored with proper amounts of capsicum, thus pushing the Scoville Units up to an acceptable level.
Mexican Seafood Cocktail...Good effort at the traditional version, albeit the least adventuresome. They make one that has shrimp,crab, octopus, squid, fish, etc. that would have gone over even better with the organ meat eaters. Does not compare to Goode Co.'s version, which is Tex-Mex'ized. Must be why Joe thought it was Ketchup....This version,  which I have eaten in Mexico is nothing more than Ceviche'ized random seafood, Pico, and the Mexican equivalent of V8 juice. Served with lime wedges and saltine crackers, like the natives do it.

Fish and Shrimp Main Course....Thought the fish was exceptionally fresh and tasty. Enjoyed the ""Diablo"" version the best w/ the corn tortillas and Guacamole. Very unique item seldom seen on menus. Would go back just for that. The shrimp suffered from too long in the fryer disease. It needs to be started in the fryer, cooked 1/4 of the way to render the bacon fat away, then finished over a char-grill to give it a smoky flavor. That step seemed to have been left out...fryer the whole time. They probably don't even have a char-grill.

Ritas- ""Rocas"" were good, Frozen was non-descript. Dos XX reliable as always. Perhaps we will get Michaladas next time, as discussed.
Overall...I'd go back, like I said, just for that fish!!!!

OUT

Subject: RESULTS OF MAN NIGHT

Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander,  
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how  
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat,  
bowel distress and ""grapes"" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN  
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn  
down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for  
being most ""in"" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

"Vacation Policy Information","

EA Estate Group:

Please see the below reference of Enron's vacation eligibility, allowance, and scheduling policy:

Vacation Eligibility:
All regular full-time employees are eligible for vacation based on continuous service.  Regular part-time employees receive 40 hours per year of paid vacation per year.  Temporary employees are not eligible for vacation.

Vacation Allowance:
Vacation allowance is based on an employee's continuous service according to the following schedule.  Employees must be on the payroll and actively at work as of the first business day of the calendar month to accrue vacation for that month.  If the first day of the month falls on a holiday or weekend, causing the employee to have a hire date other than the first, the vacation accrual date will be dated the first of the month so that the employee will accrue vacation for the month.  (For example, an employee with a hire date of January 5, 1998 will have a vacation accrual date of January 1, 1998.  The intent of this change is only to affect the vacation accrual date as explained; it is not to affect any other term, condition, privilege, or benefit of employment.)

Length of Continuous Service--Vacation Allowed
From hire date to the end of the calendar year in which the employee was hired -- Prorated accrual of 10 hours per month for each full calendar month completed.
For an employee hired in a prior calendar year who has less than 10 years of service -- 3 weeks (120 hours) per year
For an employee with at least 10 but less than 20 years of service -- 4 weeks (160 hours) per year
For an employee with at least 20 years of service -- 5 weeks (200 hours) per year
Vacation may be taken any time in the calendar year in which the employee will complete required service for 3 weeks, 4 weeks, or 5 weeks of vacation, per the schedule above, except for the hire year.

Vacation Scheduling and Approval:
Supervisors- The supervisor will develop a vacation schedule that ensures all essential operations are maintained effectively.  All vacation requests are subject to Supervisor approval.  

Tthe Estate will continue to implement its current policy with respect to the payment of unused vacation under most circumstances.  Any questions regarding this policy should be addressed to Khymberly Booth @ X52532.

Thanks-
ENA Human Resources

Subject: Good News, Lease Signed


Well, you never know...
Got back into the office today after taking two days off with Sheila and
family in Fredricksburg to find a thick envelope from Mertz Ranch Company
buried in my ""in box"". Did not know what to expect, had visions of Mertz
mailing it back with a note saying forget it.
Instead, the lease was signed and dated and had a nice note saying ""thanks"".

Go figure.

We've got a lease for four more years. Same deal, same contract as the last
three years, just 6K more a year. Price remains the same this year. next
year it is 2k a year per spot and we will need to add one spot. Still
waiting on Chet. Would like to know who McCombs would suggest if Chet does
not commit. Lease requires Mertz to spent 2k a year on protien feed. He and
I can agree in writing to reduce or increase that amount with a
corresponding reduction or increase in lease cost. Term is April 1, 2002 to
April 1 2005; exclusive right to hunt turkey and deer, spring turkey
starting the third weekend in april.

I'm pleased. Hope you are, too.

Erik.

"RE: Williams invoices for Tenaska","I believe James' contact at Williams is Shelly O'Brian 918-573-5403.  We will try and get the wire out today - but that depends on Rick signing it and the bank cooperating.  There was a misunderstanding that the $2.3MM needed to be paid regardless of if the November payment was made or not.

Karen - please prepare the funding request for today.

Subject:	RE: Williams invoices for Tenaska

Good news on the November payment.  However, we still need to execute the wire for $2,290,500 to prepay April supply costs inasmuch as the issue here relates more to our inability to get an L/C in place prior to the end of this month.  We're working on the L/C matter with JP Morgan, and will have it resolved in April.  In the meantime, we've agreed to make the prepayment prior to Williams accepting April nominations (due yesterday per Joe Parks).

Mike needs to follow through with Williams on the November payment based on our findings.  Any idea who James may have spoke with at Williams?  It would be helpful to Mike to have this information when he calls the credit analyst that brought the issue to his attention.  Also, in response to Margaret's comment below, I think James made the December payment to Williams directly as a result of the Lone Star problem and our own cash management issues.

Thanks,

RH

Subject:	FW: Williams invoices for Tenaska

Please see the attached spreadsheet showing payments for Williams.  We are getting more detail on these payments (ie dates, Fed reference numbers), but you can see that Enron has pretty much paid all the invoices for Tenaska.  Theresa spoke with James on this matter and he said he spoke with Apache and Williams when the snafu with Lone Star was realized, and both said that Tenaska was paid up to date.  This being the situation, we did not prepare a funding request for the prepayment to Williams for April.

Margaret is working on getting the payment info for Apache.  I expect to have it soon.  

Thanks, 
Karen

Karen

I have added columns for the actual amount of the supply verification that I have, the amount of the payment that was sent and the date the payment was sent.  I can't see what happened in December either, I can't even find a file for December.

I will go ahead and check the Apache payments now.

Subject:	Williams invoices for Tenaska

Margaret, attached is a spreadsheet that shows 1) the payments Tenaska IV made to ENA.  2) the Williams and Apaches invoice amounts and numbers that should have been paid.  I don't have statement numbers for all the Williams invoices, but I put the contract number on there.  For the payment that Tenaska made to ENA in January, I'm not sure how much went to Williams and how much went to Apache.  The invoices for those vendors for that month total to more than the money that Tenaska sent to Enron.  So whatever you can find out will be helpful.  

If you would look into the Williams stuff first and let us know what you find as quickly as possible, we would appreciate it.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks a bunch!

"FW: Letter to TXU","Theresa,

Can you take the lead on this as well?

Per Weil Gotshal, ENA also needs to invoice PPEP for agency fees since last collected (December through February?).  Although we do not have an executed agreement relating to agency services and the payment of the fees, the attorneys feel that the course of performance and the substantially completed agreement for gas agency services (dated November 2000) that was followed are sufficient to constitute a verbal agreement.  I'm not sure who previously generated the invoices, but I'll go out on a limb and say that they're not longer here.  Fees for the month of December are $0.0400 per MMBtu and $0.0406 per MMBtu for January, February and the remainder of 2002 (Mike, please check me on the 2002 figure by looking at the CPI-U data and confirm it with Theresa).

Thanks,

RH

Rick:

See the attached letter and the spreadsheet (created by Joe) for these volumes. I'm going to have Theresa Vos create a PPEP invoice for this amount.

I need additional contact info from Ken and left him a message. Edit or laugh at will.

"My New Position","Dear friends and colleagues,
 
I wanted to inform you that I am leaving Hart Publications shortly to take a position as the Majority Staff Director of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. The Subcommittee is part of the House Committee on Resources and has jurisdiction over oil and gas development, coal and hard rock mining and geothermal energy development on federal lands including the offshore Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountains and Alaska. My last day at Hart is May 10 and I start at the Subcommittee on May 13.

I am looking forward to this new opportunity though I have had a great experience at Hart Publications and Hart Downstream Energy Services and I am really going to miss the people I work with here. Hart is really like a family - in the Washington office and in Houston. I can't speak highly enough about the organization and the professional people I have worked with for over eight years.  

If you want to reach me at the Subcommittee, the number is (202) 225-9297. I believe that my email will be jack.belcher@mail.house.gov <mailto:jack.belcher@mail.house.gov>

I look foward to staying in touch.

Sincerely,

"Document Retention","As stated in my earlier email, the Company is under an obligation to retain, among other documents identified in the Bankruptcy Court's February 15, 2002 Order, a copy of which you all have received by email, all documents that relate to a pending or threatened investigation or lawsuit. As I am sure you are aware from reading the newspapers and watching television, because of the number of investigations and lawsuits the universe of relevant documents in just this one category covered by the Order is very large. You must retain all relevant company-related documents until these actual or threatened lawsuits and investigations are over. No one can then second-guess whether you destroyed a relevant document. However, many of you have requested guidance on what must be retained in this category of documents. To that end, attached are the various subject matters of subpoenas and document requests that we have received. While you should be sure to take the time to review the subpoenas and document requests themselves, some of the topics covered are the following:
1.  All special purpose entities (including, but not limited to, Whitewing, Marlin, Atlantic, Osprey, Braveheart, Yosemite, MEGS, Margaux, Backbone, Nahanni, Moose, Fishtail, and Blackhawk)
2. All LJM entities
3. Chewco
4. JEDI I and II
5. The Raptor structures
6. Related party transactions
7. Portland General acquisition
8. Elektro acquisition
9. Cuiaba project
10. Nowa Sarzyna project
11. Dabhol project
12. The Dynegy merger
13. All accounting records
14. All structured finance documents
15. Audit records
16. All records relating to purchases or sales of Enron stock
17. All records relating to Enron stock options
18. All records relating to the Enron Savings Plan, Cash Balance Plan, ESOP, and any other employee benefit plans 
19. Communications with analysts
20. Communications with investors
21. Communications with credit rating agencies
22. All documents relating to California
23. All documents relating to Rio Piedras
24. All documents relating to pipeline safety
25. All corporate tax documents
26. All structured finance documents
27. ENA collateralized loan obligations
28. All periodic reports to management (including, but not limited to, VAR Reports, Daily Position Reports, Capital Portfolio Statements, Merchant Portfolio Statements, and Earnings Flash Reports)
29. All press releases and records of public statements
30. All DASHs
31. All policy manuals
32. All records relating to political contributions
33. All documents relating to or reflecting communications with the SEC, CFTC, FERC, or DOL
34. All documents relating to Enron's dark fiber optic cable 
35. Mariner
36. Matrix
37. ECT Securities
38. Enron Online
39. All documents relating to the Enron PAC
40. All documents reflecting any communication with any federal agency, Congress, or the Executive Office of the President
41. All documents relating to Enron Broadband
42. Drafts and non-identical duplicates relating to any of the foregoing.
Though lengthy, this list is not inclusive. Please review the subpoenas and document requests for the precise topics covered. If you have any questions please contact Bob Williams, the Company's Litigation Manager, at (713) 345-2402 or email him at Robert.C.Williams@enron.com.
As always, thank you for your patience during this challenging time.

"Update on Retention & Severance Plan","
We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

"FW: EES Price, Basis and Index Positions (as of 03.22.01)","Joe, the EES book data is getting closer to what we need but not there yet.

Please discuss w/ EES Risk (Scott Mills?):
1) The Price (NG) positions are expressed in PV'd quantity.  We need this data in nominal form in order to place the appropriate number of contract hedges through our NYMEX broker.  
2) We need the NYMEX equivalent positions for basis so we can place NYMEX hedges as proxy for basis.

Maria has a call into Pat Ryder to determine whether the ENA Price positions are PV'd or nominal.  We may need those adjusted as well.

Please set up a meeting w/ Risk to discuss the concept of NYMEX equivalent basis contracts.  Include ENA and EES risk folks as well as me, Maria Garza, and Yuan Tian.  (Yuan is out today.)  As you commented, we need to determine that we agree with the methodology and conversion factor prior to including basis in the hedge quantity.

Thanks

Please note the following -there are separate tabs for price, basis and index.
	The tabs that indicate ""OXY II Only"" are exactly that -the deals associated with the potential second bid from OXY for additional activity.
	The tabs that DO NOT indicate OXY II consolidate both the base keeper list + the OXY II activity.

If there is any doubt as to what you are looking at, check the first four lines or the worksheet.  There will be a designation of what is and is not included.

"FW: FW: Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services","Joe,
I spoke with Centana's attorney. According to him, they are not opposed
to the escrow account, just the hassle of paper work, but he is checking
with his commercial person and will get back to me today. I told him ENA
wants to do the deal, ENA is willing to open the escrow account, but
that's the deal. So I expect to hear from him shortly.

Attached is the email from Centana's attorney. At the very beginning of

Kay,  Mark is aware of this transaction.  The following is his response
to Centana's counsel email.  I did discuss with Mark this morning, the
current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made
sense.  

As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they
would net out post-petition fees.  Our business people feel that we have
used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees
would be an administrative expense.  An amount equivalent to the
pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court
resolved the pre-petition amounts.   All remaining amounts would be
delivered to Enron North America.

Dan Leff floor presentation on Friday March 22nd, 10:00 AM
came here 5 years ago, Mechanical enigeer, sold his business FMES in 1997 to EES and been with EES every since.

we have about 1,000 people left in wholesale and retail
about 800 people in support groups
we've lost about 7,000 people since Dec 2nd.

3 things
1.  where is the business now
we know where we are, where we are going, retention\
pooled wholesale and retail resources
figure out how to get the people together

we've completly revamped the sr management team
target recovery of $6 billion dollars for the estate team, this is not a book value or firesell value.
$3 bill in ENA, $1.4 EES  $600 mill enron canada.....so forth.
stan hortin   mike mcconnel looking at packaging deal and assets together to develope a new reorganized company.

2.
we are important, the people that is
all the difficult times are behind us
he understands our urge to leave
take a deep breath, think about how what you do will enhance career.

retention plan should be presented next week, will be filed next week with the bankruptcy court.
creditor's committee has approved the retention plan

plan brings substantial amount of money to bear 
jobs may change
email will go out next week detailing plan
management will talk to people before next friday about how the overall retention plan will impact us and our coworkers


Liquidation bucket - people settleing terminated positions, assets, primarily commercial oriented.  Commision type environment.
Retention Pool - cetain amount of money is paid on a qtrly basis.
Severeance plan - safety net for people not in retention or liguidation bucket.
anyone in severance plan will have their monies offset by any monies they recieve  on one of the other plans.

3.
personal message 
be positive
have some fun
get a bounce back in your walk
you can be part of fixing it
take next year or 2 years to learn and develope.

queston:  what is the goal of the company
we are selling books of business, assets, and substantial amount of backoffice work needs to be done to do the settlements.
we are not going to try and develope new business.

question:  org chart?
We should be developing one over the next few weeks.

Can we get this reversed out of the system.  I think that a buy from Williams and a sale to Tenaska IV are all wrapped up in this together.  I think that Jan production onward should probably all get reversed out.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is ""zero-rated""  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, ""Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months"".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

Just an update. I spoke with Mike Richards and later today he will send
me the rest of his comments so that we can be ready to finalize the deal
if Greg returns and is ready to pull the trigger. 

Mike inquired of their bank and apparently they can open an escrow
account with slightly lower fees. Mike thinks the difference is about
$1500. Given the lack of control over the process and the fact that we
have an escrow account already finalized, I told him that I didn't think
ENA was interested in their opening another account, but I wanted to
check with you Joe.

Last, I checked and there is no jeopardy from a bankruptcy perspective
of finding a new buyer for the gas in the event that Centana declines to
move forward.

"2002 bp MS150","I finished the ride!  I again want to say again to all of you for supporting my ride.  Your donation is for a good cause.  Finally, your cancelled check to the National MS Society will serve as your tax receipt.  Please send me an email if you have any questions.

Below is my story if you wish to read more.
=======================================

Prologue

Should I do it or not?  This was a question that had to be answered.....and soon.  This question had been lurking in the back of my mind since I'd already seen some gnarly bike crashes before and I've heard all the nasty stories about them.  So I was basically reluctant to do so, but I was obviously curious about it and so I had mixed feeling altogether.  I jumped on the internet for some perspective and discovered the pros and cons.  I figured, if I did happen to be involved in a pile-up, then I'd be sorry.  In the end, I did it.  In the tradition of cycling, I decided to shave my legs!

Day One - 100 miles

My alarm sounded off at 4:30 and I jumped out of bed, quickly dressed, and threw my gear into my Jeep and hit the road. The MS150 ride started at 7am.  And with 10,000 riders participating, my goal was to avoid as much traffic as possible.  Thankfully, the team I rode with (Sun & Ski Sport) started in the number two position.  bp, the corporate sponsor, started off the race.  It should be noted that my ride started at Tully Stadium (Dairy Ashford/I-10) as opposed to Rhodes Stadium (located in Katy) and so an extra 15 miles were immediately tacked on.

From my POV, this day's ride was no different from any other I did in the preceding weeks other than the fact that it was longer by about 40 miles.  After the start and once the crowd thinned out, I got into my groove (after pulling over for a quick relief stop) and stayed within my own and kept a moderate speed with a high cadence.  The sun was above the clouds, but while en route a large, dark menacing cloud seemed to head my direction, but thankfully it amounted to nothing and the cloud cover remained most of the day.

I admit, my goal was to get to LaGrange as soon as possible without exerting too much energy early on.  In order to do this, I avoided the official rest-stops as much as possible.  When I did pull in for a snack or to refill my CamelBack with water, it was a long wait as there were a few hundred people at each stop.  At my first stop, I misplaced my cyclometer.  I removed it from my bike so that no one would steal it.  I got off my bike, stretched my legs, and loaded up on liquids and oranges.  On my way back to my bike, I noticed my cyclometer was neither in my hand nor in my jersey.  ****!  So I went back to the food table and asked the volunteers if they'd seen it (they had not), and I looked in the nearby trashcans.  No luck.  Now I was disappointed but I put it behind me.  On my way back to my bike, I SAW IT ON THE GROUND.  Whew!  So back on the road.

After a few more rest stops (to stretch and liquid-load) and even more roadside relief stops, I arrived in Bellville for lunch.  With my goal in mind, I quickly ate and hit the road again.  The ride became more scenic but my body began to get restless, namely my back, neck and rear end.  The sun broke the through the clouds and I began to sweat profusely.  To wipe away the sweat I used my ""pedal partner"" bandana.  My partner is someone named Kathryn who has MS.  The point of the program is to get to know this person and let them know that I was able to do what they could not because of the disease.

There were lots of spectators in LaGrange, and the campsite was not far the from city limits' edge.  The crowds lined the road for 1/2 a mile.  After I arrived at 2:40, I checked in my bike, went to the Sun & Ski team tent, got my clothes, took a cool shower (this was awesome), ate lunch, and waited for a massage.  I was obviously tired and tried to get a nap in but, with the sun up, it was difficult to do.  Eventually, I pulled The Sun Also Rises from my bag and began to read randomly (it's one of my favorite books).  I woke up an hour later feeling much better.  

By this time, it's around 7 o'clock and the sun is still up, so I wandered the campgrounds, ate some more, and visited friends on other teams.  Once the DJ closed shop and the staff began to make room for people to sleep, I setup camp in a quiet corner of the tent, stretched as much as possible and went to sleep.

My times on this day:  3'18"" from Houston to Bellville, 23"" for lunch, 3'52"" from Bellville to LaGrange.  Total time = 7'34""

Day Two - 80 miles

No alarm was necessary on this day because the portable generators all seemed to fire up around the same time - 4:30.  It was hard to get out of bed but I eventually did.  I had to load my gear, fill my CamelBack, stretch, and wait in line for the start.  By 6:30 I was at the back of the pack and I did not like this.  From this vantage, I would not leave Bellville until after 8 o'clock.  I followed a misfit gang that tried to go another route to exit the campgrounds, but while doing so a ""pppsssttt"" sound came from my rear tire. That sounds means only one thing - a flat tire.  ****!  I went to the repair tent and found that the tire was sliced...either the tire was damaged or I walked over some glass.  The repair line was short and $29 was the damage for a new tube and tire.  On the bright side, I was closer to the start and got out on the road much earlier than I anticipated.

Overall, my body wasn't too tired and my legs felt okay.  The night before I stretched frequently, took gobs of Advil, and rested as much as possible.  I feared day two the most because word was out that the route had lots of hills and 80 miles is no easy task.  I deliberately started off slow just to get the blood flowing and to loosen up the muscles.  10 miles had past and I was fine.  I had to decide by mile 25 whether to go the hilly route (Bastrop State Park) or bypass it entirely.  

I talked to a few riders about it and chose to do the hills.  At mile 25 was the entrance to the park and a rest area.  I loaded up on liquids and decided to get a quick massage at the medical tent.  A rider told me he did this the day before and felt much better afterwards.  And so I was on the park course and the hills were short and steep.  The reward for climbing these hill was a well-deserved coast on the other side.  Then another hill.  And another...et cetera.  This was the case for about 10 miles.  The last hill was the most difficult.  The burn in my thighs and rear was more evident but I kept going.  My goal for this segment was to not stop.  Many others did but I went to my lowest gear and grinded it out.  After the last hill was the home stretch.  Lunch was minutes away at Bastrop H.S.

I was psychologically confident at this point since I only had 40 miles left and the hard part was behind me.  Upon immediate (and post-race reflection, I determined that the ride through the state park was the best part of the ride.  It had everything - shade, cooler air, no wind, hills, and a thinner road in which to maneuver.  It required me to focus, relax, and strategize on how to approach each hill.  Although I consider myself a beginner biker, I think I graduated to the intermediate level after than experience.

I still felt okay after the hills since I stretched quite well during lunch.  But I was back on the road because Austin was not going to get any closer with me staying in LaGrange.  I stopped at one rest area and pulled over another time.  Soon afterward, the ""Austin 24"" was in sight.  Only 24 more miles!  I was at my own pace when a rather large peloton passed by.  I decided to get on-board and kept with it for about 8 miles.  They were pedaling faster than I could keep up and I admit it took a lot out of me.  I knew the finish was near but my legs began to falter.

The final 5 miles was made up of more hills but it was the final stretch.  Many bikers were in their lowest gear including myself.  The path narrowed to about 8' since we were in the city and this made for dangerous conditions on the hills.  There is always a reckless biker who is interested in speed only and, unfortunately there was one such person near me who would pass me on the downhill at high speed, but I would pass him on the uphill.  Because of him, I nearly had a spill.  He came a little too close on a downhill.  We exchanged a few words and I deliberately slowed to let him pass.  Jerk!

And the crowds were there in Austin cheering us on.  One more dip and hill and the finish line was near.  Could this be the end?  It was.  I took my final picture of the finish line and was thankful that I finished.  I rarely go to Austin but when I do, it's on a bike.  Funny, huh?

Now I'm hungry, very hungry but I need to check in at the Sun & Ski tent, claim my luggage, shower and then finally eat.  To do this took about 1.5 hours because of the many other people wanting to do the same thing.  I probably ate too many cookies but my appetite was very strong and I didn't care what I ate at this point.  The Hooter's chicken sandwich was not enough to satisfy my hunger, but the two Shiners I had satisfied my thirst.

It was time to go home, so I claimed my bus ticket, loaded my bags and boarded the bus with my pillow.  The people on board had lots of enthusiasm as we exchanged stories and experiences.  This lasted for about an hour and we all seemed to fall asleep at the same time.  I woke up with lots of drool on my pillow and felt a little better.  Food was on my mind again and, by this point, I just wanted to be at home in my bed.  We pulled into Tully Stadium, I claimed my bike, drove home, and went to sleep.

My times on this day:  3'25"" from LaGrange to Bastrop, 44"" for lunch, 2'42"" from LaGrange to Austin.  Total time = 6'51""

TOTAL BIKING TIME (including lunches) = 14'26""

"feeder motors","Chris and Kieth: Thought cam to me after I talked to you guys regarding 
BOOGER motor. Chris, was that spincast the one with the bent up aluminum 
housing on the inside??? If it is, that is the one that I sent to get 
repaired. I have a feeling that it is not. I think it might be the motor 
that was at the mesquite flat last year. If it is, that motor has a week 
spin motor and occationally would get stuck by slight resistance from corn, 
but the clock would still work fine. If that is the one that is now at 
booger, pulling the guts and replacing it will do nothing. It is the spin 
motor that needs to be replaced. If it is the one that is all muddy, it is 
the one that was at gray box last year and got trashed by the coons at the 
end of last year. It looked like it was working, but apparently is not.

Talk to each other and see if you can figure out which one it is.

Doing a count of feeders, I think there is still one Magnum black photo box 
in the trailer and I know there are two green tubes. I think our best option 
may be to put a magunum on booger with a conversion (free) and shelf the 
spincast or confirm what is wrong with it before we dump more $ into another 
one of those piece of shit motors.

Please advise on your thoughts. e.

"Plans for New Energy Company","

To:  Enron Employees Worldwide
From:  Stephen Cooper
Date:  Thursday, May 2, 2002

As I mentioned at the employee meeting in April, this Friday, May 3, we will present to the Creditors' Committee a plan to separate our core energy assets from the estate and the issues surrounding our bankruptcy through a process called a ""363 Sale.""  These assets are viable businesses that represent Enron's roots.  If we are able to move quickly, we believe this 363 Sale process will allow us to maximize the value of these assets.

We intended to rollout our plan to employees early next week following the presentation to the Creditors' Committee.  However, the Wall Street Journal got a relatively final draft of our plan and were prepared to run a story today.  To ensure accuracy, we decided to work with the Journal on their story and I participated in an interview late yesterday afternoon.

I certainly regret that you have to learn about our plans from the media rather than directly from me or other members of the management team.  Yet until we present to the Creditors' Committee, we are still not at liberty to share the full details of the plan with employees.  We look forward to proceeding with our rollout early next week.  In the meantime, we've attached below the article from the Wall Street Journal.


Enron Plans Return to Its Roots --- Draft Proposal to Creditors Envisions a Smaller Firm Focused on Hard Assets
By Rebecca Smith and Mitchell Pacelle
The Wall Street Journal

	Enron Corp. plans to reorganize as a small company under a new name, according to a draft copy of the firm's plans -- returning to its roots of a decade ago, before the aggressive strategy that led to its spectacular expansion and then collapse. 
	Under plans scheduled to be presented to creditors Friday, Enron would carve out a small integrated energy company with assets of about $10 billion in North and South America. The new entity would likely take a new name in order to escape the taint of Enron's fall and the baggage of numerous investigations into its finances.
	It would then be put on the block in bankruptcy court, quickly giving Enron's creditors the choice to retain a stake in the new company -- or sell it off, whole or in parts, if more attractive bids emerge. 
	Enron lost the confidence of creditors and investors as revelations emerged last fall that the Houston-based company had hid debt and pumped up profit through a series of off-balance-sheet ventures that in some cases enriched a handful of senior executives. After failing to merge with rival Dynegy Corp., the company sought bankruptcy-court protection in December, the largest such filing in U.S. history. 
	The new plan calls for a small operating company -- for now dubbed ""OpCO Energy Co."" -- to own power plants, electric utilities, natural-gas pipelines and liquefied-natural-gas facilities, but little else. The biggest properties would be the Portland General Electric utility in Oregon; Elektro, a Sao Paulo-based Brazilian utility and about 15,000 miles of pipeline assets on both continents -- less than half the amount of pipes that Enron once possessed. 
	The plan would essentially make the Enron successor little different from other U.S. energy companies that provide electricity and natural gas, giving it few advantages over competitors. It would also make the new company more reliant than ever on volatile South American operations at a time when its U.S. rivals are scaling back their commitments in the region. 
	Nevertheless, Enron's new management team, headed since January by restructuring specialist Stephen Cooper, hopes that the creation of a new company will protect the assets it needs from a long bankruptcy-reorganization process that could hurt their value. Under the company's plan, all of Enron's other assets would be liquidated in that process. The number of employees would drop steeply -- from about 23,000 today (already down from a peak of 31,000 before the bankruptcy) to around 12,000. 
	""In my view, we're going to be in bankruptcy for a number of years, because of the difficulty we're going to have resolving all of the claims,"" Mr. Cooper said in an interview yesterday afternoon, after Enron's board had met to go over the plan. 
	A spinoff, he said, also could protect the new business from problems stemming from the bankruptcy such as customers wary of entering into new contracts and a welter of litigation and competing claims. Customers who otherwise might shun Enron could embrace the new company, Mr. Cooper predicted: ""Once we're out from under, what they will see is a company with great assets and great cash flow that can stand on its own two legs."" 
	Enron's creditors wield enormous influence over how the bankruptcy reorganization will unfold. Mr. Cooper and his advisers will have to convince these unsecured creditors -- who have asserted billions of dollars in claims -- that they stand to recover more of their money by turning Enron's core assets into a new company than selling them off in a fire sale. Because Enron now owes a fiduciary obligation to them, these creditors have the power to press the company to alter the plan considerably, or to proceed directly to a liquidation. 
	""The [creditors'] committee has a bunch of bright, reasonable businesspeople on it,"" said Mr. Cooper. ""Their goal, to maximize value, is consistent with ours. I'm confident that we will be able to make a case for value maximization by adopting this approach."" 
	Luc Despins, a lawyer for the creditors' committee, said he hadn't yet seen the plan and couldn't comment. 
	Protracted negotiations are likely to follow the Friday meeting. If and when Enron reaches an accord with creditors, Enron will file the plan with the bankruptcy court, which must then approve it. 
	The proposed reorganization would sweep away a decade of rapid growth, returning the company to its size in 1992, when former Chairman Kenneth Lay and then-President Richard Kinder were running the company. Four years later, Mr. Kinder left Enron and was replaced by Jeffrey Skilling, under whose leadership the company began to disparage hard assets and emphasize the energy-trading business that eventually turned Enron into a far larger concern. 
	Whether the new company can escape the taint of Enron is far from certain. ""The success of OpCo as a going concern will depend on its ability to separate reputationally from Enron,"" the draft business plan says. In addition to winning support from creditors, Enron must disentangle itself from many complicated financial arrangements and an existing agreement to sell Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas Co., a deal which hasn't yet closed. 
	In recent months, new managers have devoted considerable energy to trying to understand Enron's complicated financial arrangements. They are also trying to unravel the contents of a plethora of ""SPEs"" or special-purpose entities. They were created, beginning in the mid-1990s, as a way to pump up profits, hide debt and raise money from outside investors. 
	The draft plan contains a list of assets Enron wishes to retain for the new company, some of which may be entangled in these special-purpose entities. For example, Centragas, a pipeline company in Colombia, is a proposed asset of the new company. But separate, internal spreadsheets reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show that controlling interest of that pipeline already had been pledged to two investment vehicles, Rawhide LP and Whitewing LP. They, in turn, may have passed along interests to other Enron entities, Tombstone Assets LLC and Ponderosa Assets LP. 
	The company said it is trying to ""unwind"" many of the investment vehicles to gain clear title to the assets for the new company, but it cautioned that ""the unwind and resolution of these structures may affect the financial results presented"" for the new company. 
	If the new company is created as outlined, its pro forma net income -- based on past performance of the units it hopes to retain -- is projected to be $243 million this year, $352 million next year, $450 million in 2004 and $503 million by 2005. That is based on assets of $10.1 billion currently, rising to $11 billion by 2003. 
	That's a far cry from what Enron claimed at its peak. In 2000, the last year that full financial records were posted by the company, Enron said its net income was $979 million on $100.8 billion in revenue. Those numbers -- as well as financial statements in the previous three years -- were eventually retracted as Enron came under increasing scrutiny from investors and regulators. 
	The plan said the company wants to keep enough assets to form the basis of a new company because the market is ""already overloaded with properties for sale"" and prices aren't very good. Enron's collapse is partly to blame for that market glut, because credit standards have been tightening, forcing many energy firms to shed assets and pare debt.

Joe, the EES book data is getting closer to what we need but not there yet.

Please discuss w/ EES Risk (Scott Mills?):
1) The Price (NG) positions are expressed in PV'd quantity.  We need this data in nominal form in order to place the appropriate number of contract hedges through our NYMEX broker.  
2) We need the NYMEX equivalent positions for basis so we can place NYMEX hedges as proxy for basis.

Maria has a call into Pat Ryder to determine whether the ENA Price positions are PV'd or nominal.  We may need those adjusted as well.

Please set up a meeting w/ Risk to discuss the concept of NYMEX equivalent basis contracts.  Include ENA and EES risk folks as well as me, Maria Garza, and Yuan Tian.  (Yuan is out today.)  As you commented, we need to determine that we agree with the methodology and conversion factor prior to including basis in the hedge quantity.

Please note the following -there are separate tabs for price, basis and index.
	The tabs that indicate ""OXY II Only"" are exactly that -the deals associated with the potential second bid from OXY for additional activity.
	The tabs that DO NOT indicate OXY II consolidate both the base keeper list + the OXY II activity.

If there is any doubt as to what you are looking at, check the first four lines or the worksheet.  There will be a designation of what is and is not included.

   Thursday 2/21/02
   Raymond James Energy Daily Update

   FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY

   Energy Price Summary (Close Wednesday 2/20/02):
   Oil (WTI) - $20.29, down $0.59
   12-Month Oil Futures Strip - $20.63, down $0.52
   Natural Gas (HHUB) -$2.39, down $0.01
   12-Month Natural Gas Futures Strip - $2.75, unchanged
   1% Residual Oil (on a Mcf basis) - $2.55, up $0.03
   London Crude Oil - $20.20, up $0.34 (so far this morning)

   1) AGA reports in-line injection, gas prices surge show strength on cold
   weather forecast/short covering
      Last week, 112 Bcf was withdrawn from storage, compared to 81 Bcf
      last year and expectations for a 115-120 Bcf withdrawal.
      Total storage is now 1,944 Bcf, which is 960 above last year.
      This week's report showed 4-5 Bcf/d less gas available for storage
      relative to last year on a weather-adjusted basis.
      The near-month (March) futures contract showed some strength this
      week, after the National Weather Service (NWS) forecasted
      colder-than-normal weather in several key consuming regions during
      the next 2 weeks.? Additionally, short covering by traders probably
      added to the positive momentum.? The contract traded as high as
      $2.46/MMBtu this week, before slipping to $2.40/MMBtu after the AGA's
      report.
      To reach 1,500 Bcf of gas in storage by the end of the traditional
      withdrawal season, approximately 74 Bcf/week would have to be pulled
      from storage on average over the last six weeks.? This compares to
      approximately 56 Bcf/week withdrawn during the same period last year
      under normal temperatures.? As a result, of the NWS's forecast is
      accurate, we could still hit the 1,500 Bcf mark.? However, if weather
      remains 15-20% warmer than normal, the probability of withdrawing
      that much gas decreases substantially.
      Longer-term, we continue to believe that natural gas fundamentals
      will be a supply driven equation.? Based on fourth quarter production
      volumes reported so far, it appears that U.S. natural gas production
      will, in fact, show both sequential and year-to-year declines.
      Despite the potential for near-term weakness in prices, we remain
      bullish on the intermediate and longer-term fundamentals for natural
      gas.


   2) The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported that total petroleum
   inventories decreased 5.5 MMBbls to 673.6 MMBbls for the week ended
   February 15, 2002.

   ??????? The consensus range called for a 0.7 MMBbl build to a 2.4 MMBbl
   build.? This is a bullish report for the oil market.? Total petroleum
   inventories are currently 73.5 MMBbls (~12%) above levels one year ago.

   ??????? Crude oil inventories decreased 4.5 MMBbls to 316.2 MMBbls last
   week.? Crude oil inventories are 37.5 MMBbls above last year at this
   time.? Based on our current U.S. crude oil demand estimate, there are
   approximately 17 days of crude oil inventory.
      Motor gasoline inventories increased 0.6 MMBbl to 218.2 MMBbls last
      week.? Motor gasoline inventories are 13.0 MMBbls above last year at
      this time.

   ??????? Distillate fuel inventories decreased 1.6 MMBbls to 139.2 MMBbls
   last week.? Distillate inventories are 23.0 MMBbls above last year at
   this time.

   ??????? U.S. refinery operations were at a 88.5% utilization rate, which
   was 0.7% higher than last week's 87.8% rate.? Total Petroleum imports
   decreased to 10.4 MMBbls/day.
      Despite last week's larger than anticipated draw in total petroleum
      inventories, the slowdown in U.S. economic growth that was
      exacerbated by the September 11 terrorist attacks has continued to
      weigh on demand and contribute to inventory levels that remain well
      above our 5-year average.


   OILSERVICE

   3) BJ Services Announces Another Strategic Acquisition.
   ??????? Yesterday, BJ Services (NYSE:BJS/$30.03/Strong Buy) announced
   that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with OSCA, Inc.
   (NASDAQ:OSCA/$27.65) for $28 per share (a 27% premium to the
   pre-announcement stock price).? This all-cash deal equates to a total
   purchase price of roughly $420 million and is expected to close by the
   end of the second calendar quarter.

   ??????? OSCA provides a full array of completion-related products and
   services, including completion fluids, completion tools and completion
   services.? BJ should ultimately be able to leverage the incremental
   products, services and markets across its existing asset and customer
   base to yield significant pull-through revenue opportunities down the
   road.? While it appears that BJ paid a full price for OSCA, the
   combination makes a lot of strategic sense.

   ??????? Following the announced acquisition, we are making slight
   modifications to our near-term estimates.? Specifically, we are shaving
   a nickel from our existing FY2002 estimate, bringing it down to $1.25
   per share.? This is primarily due to the closing of the acquisition
   without significant near-term cost savings or pull through benefits.? As
   management indicated on its conference call, it expects the deal to be
   accretive to the FY2003 consensus of $1.85 per share by $0.06 to $0.07
   per share.? Since we are already in print at $2.00, we are leaving our
   FY2003 estimates unchanged in order to be conservative.? Given the
   expected slight accretion to FY2003 earnings, combined with potential
   longer-term upside and an improving market outlook, we are maintaining
   our Strong Buy rating and 12-month target price of $37 per share.

   4) Tetra Technologies beats consensus by a penny and appears extremely
   undervalued relative to its peers!
      Following yesterday's acquisition of OSCA by BJ Services, it is even
      more clear now that Tetra Technologies (NYSE:TTI/$23.62/Strong Buy)
      is cheap.
      Specifically, OSCA was purchased for between 30-35x 2003 EPS, or
      12-14x 2003 EBITDA.
      If we apply those multiples to TTI, we come up with a value of $45 to
      $55 per share, as opposed to the current price of $23.62 per share.
      The TTI story is very similar to that of OSCA, only perhaps not as
      well known.
      Following OSCA's acquisition, there remains a chance that TTI could
      be taken out at some point in time (although we have no reason to
      believe it will be soon).
      Furthermore, TTI stands a chance of gaining business as a result of
      this transaction.
      Finally, the company reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.35 per share,
      a penny above consensus.? It will host a conference call today at
      10:30am ET.? The dial in number is 800-860-2442.

   5) Unit Corp. handily beats fourth quarter earnings expectations
   ??????? Unit Corp. (NYSE:UNT/$12.60/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter
   earnings of $0.27 per share, compared to $0.43 per share in the fourth
   quarter of 2000.? This result was $0.04 ahead of the consensus estimate
   of $0.23 per share.

   ??????? Revenues for the quarter came in at $49.3 million, down
   approximately 25% from last year and down 28% from the third quarter.
   Likewise, overall operating margins were down over 530 basis points
   year-to-year to about 50%, while they were also down a like amount on a
   sequential basis.

   ??????? The strong quarterly results were largely a result of
   stronger-than-expected dayrates, utilization and margins during the
   quarter.? In fact, average dayrates were down by only about $800 to just
   under $10,200 per day.? Meanwhile, average realized oil and natural gas
   prices reflected the current softer commodity price environment with
   declines on a year-to-year basis of 41% for oil and 61% for gas.
   Production volumes also decreased from last year by 2% for oil and 15%
   for natural gas.

   ??????? Despite the generally strong results, drilling activity has
   fallen dramatically over the past couple months.? This drop in overall
   rig activity has had a significant impact on Unit's utilization,
   dropping from a quarterly average of nearly 71% rigs in Q4 to the
   current run-rate of 60%, pulling dayrates down another 10-15% currently.

   ??????? Due to declines in the near-term outlook for drilling and
   production, combined with Unit's current activity indicators (dayrates,
   utilization, production and commodity prices), we are adjusting our
   quarterly estimates but keeping our annual estimates.? Accordingly, we
   are maintaining our 2002 estimate of $0.80 per share and our 2003
   estimate of $1.40 per share.? Despite the lack of near-term visibility,
   the improving long-term outlook causes us to maintain our Strong Buy
   rating with a 12-month target price of $18 per share (based on a blended
   average of three valuation techniques).

   6) Conrad Reports Very Disappointing Quarterly Loss
      Conrad Industries (NASDAQ:CNRD/$4.10/Strong Buy) reported its fourth
      quarter of a loss of $0.02 per share, compared to a profit of $0.10
      per share in the fourth quarter of 2000.? This results missed the
      consensus estimate by $0.14 per share.
      Revenues for the quarter came in at $9.9 million, which was down 11%
      from this same quarter last year and down 23% from last quarter.? The
      gross margin for the quarter was 13.8%, which was down over 800 basis
      points from the year ago period and down almost 800 basis points
      sequentially.
      The backlog at quarter-end stood at $10.4 million, down 49% from the
      fourth quarter of 2000 but up 4% from last quarter.
      The Company blamed the poor quarterly performance on weakness in the
      economy and offshore oil and gas industry.
      The Company will host a conference call at 10:30am ET this morning.
      You may access the call by dialing 800-966-6502.? A replay will be
      available by dialing 800-677-6200 and using access code 2280.

   E&P

   7) AEC Beats 4Q Expectations, EnCana Merger On Track
      AEC (NYSE:AOG/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter 2001 EPS of C$0.55
      per share, which was ahead of our estimate of C$0.40 per share.
      AEC achieved record sales averaging 356,000 Boe/d, up 20% from 2000.
      Each of the three growth platforms - Canada, the U.S. Rockies and
      Ecuador - set new records.
      In 2001, AEC's established conventional reserves rose by 15% to
      nearly 6 Tcf of gas and more than 600 million Bbls of oil and natural
      gas liquids. The Company replaced 276% of 2001 conventional sales,
      with 89% of the reserve additions coming through the drill bit. The
      largest reserve additions were in the U.S. Rockies and northeast
      British Columbia.
      The merger with PanCanadian remains on track with shareholder's
      meetings scheduled for early April and closing expected shortly
      thereafter.
      Alberta Energy's merger with PanCanadian Energy to form EnCana will
      create the largest and fastest growing super independent producer in
      the industry with a C$27 billion enterprise value and visible
      production growth in excess of 14% annually for at least the next
      five years. The combined company will have a dominant position in
      North America with interests in western Canada, the U.S. Rockies,
      offshore Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as 23 million
      undeveloped acres along the Rocky Mountain Fairway from southern
      Colorado to Alaska.? EnCana will also have large international growth
      engines in Ecuador and the North Sea.
      Our target price of C$80 (US$52) is based on a 6.1x multiple of 2002
      cash flow, a valuation comparable to that of its super independent
      peers.? We reiterate our Strong Buy rating.

   8) Pure Posts Stronger Than Expected 4Q Results, Reduces Capital Budget
   for '02.
      Pure Resources (NYSE:PRS/$19.90/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of
      $0.00 per share, which was significantly higher than our estimate of
      a loss of ($0.17) and the consensus estimate of ($0.13).
      PRS's production during 4Q:01 totaled 390 Mmcfe/d, up 70% from the
      same period last year, including acquisitions made during 2001,? and
      up 85% for the full year.? However, the company lowered 2002 volume
      guidance from 12% growth to 9% growth based on a reduced capital
      spending program.? As a result, we have lowered our 2002 earnings
      estimate from $0.32 to $0.31 per share to reflect the reduced
      expectations.
      Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of $1.12
      and $6.30, respectively, based on 11% production growth from 2002 to
      2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl
      of oil.
      The Company replaced 385% of its production from all sources at a
      cost of $1.82/Mcfe, and increased its total reserves by 34% to 1,469
      Bcfe.
      We are maintaining our Strong Buy rating on shares of Pure.? Through
      experience, operational focus and the application of newer
      technology, Pure has the opportunity to create significant value in
      the ""mature"" Permian Basin.? Our target price of $24 is based on a
      5.3x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified by the
      Company's geographical focus and operating leverage in the Permian
      Basin.

   9) XTO 4Q Results In-Line With Expectations.
   ??????? XTO Energy (NYSE:XTO/$17.10/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of
   $0.42, which was in-line with our estimate of $0.41 and consensus of
   $0.40.

   ??????? XTO's production during 4Q:01 totaled 565 Mmcfe/d, up 20% from
   the same period last year and up 17% for the full year.

   ??????? Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of
   $2.19 and $5.27, respectively, based on 12% production growth from 2002
   to 2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl
   of oil.

   ??????? During the conference call, XTO mentioned that it may make an
   acquisition in lieu of a portion of its organic production growth
   through the drillbit.? More specifically, XTO may forego a portion of
   its East Texas drilling budget and use $100-150 million towards an
   acquisition.? Either way, XTO is expected to achieve its 17-20%
   production growth target.

   ??????? XTO has a multi-year inventory of development opportunities in
   the low-F&D cost Arkoma and San Juan Basins, as well as the East Texas
   Freestone and Bossier Trends.? For an E&P company, XTO has a
   large/diverse asset base, substantial project inventory, and multiple
   productive zones in its core producing areas.? We are maintaining our
   Strong Buy rating on shares of XTO based on the company's ability to
   generate consistent double-digit production growth.? Our target price of
   $24 is based on a 6.5x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified
   by the company's consistent and visible growth.

I understand your pain.  We are just stating what has been told to us by
the Gas Control group.

The answers to your questions are as follows:

1) The OFO will probably be in effect until sometime on Monday.

2) The Tenaska IV Texas Partners contract is very old and was written
before TXU LSP put hourly swing imbalance penalty provisions in the
Electric Generation contracts.   The main remedy for TXU LSP in the
contract is to physically resrict flow to the power plant to stay even with
gas receipt volumes or to demand that the power plant bring in receipt gas
to meet its burn.

I hope this helps.

Jeff:

The problem with all of the power plants is that somebody has to swing on
load to follow the electric profile. This may be us.

Also, how long is this OFO going to be in place??

Secondly, namely because I haven't thoroughly read the contract, what are
the imbalance penalties??

Thanks for the load profile.  The official word is still that TXU LSP is
requesting that all power plants stay as even as possible on their hourly
pulls with respect to their nominations.
