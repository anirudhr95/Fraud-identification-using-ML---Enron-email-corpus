12. THE MYTH OF LOWER--AND HIGHER--AIRFARES
    by Christopher Elliott

In the past several days, a number of would-be air travelers have
complained that airfares were on the upswing since terrorists felled
the World Trade Center towers and decimated the Pentagon. Truth is,
fares are likely to ease this month. But don't take my word for it.

    by Anita Dunham-Potter, Contributing Travel Editor

in the U.S. will permanently change. And they're probably right.

15. WHEN PICKING OUT SOUVENIRS, CONSIDER THE ORDINARY THINGS
    by Eoin O'Carroll

If the purpose of a souvenir is to serve as a token of remembrance of
a particular place, it's the ordinary things, not the touristy garbage,


that really count. By taking a few of these bits and pieces with you,
you might also take with you some happy memories.

"the scoop","Here's the scoop on people doing unethical broker trades:

 

Frank and Matt are the only others that have done Socal broker trades since 09/01 (I quereied from 09/01 to current).  As for Janie, she hasn't done any Socal brokered deals since July, but she has done a few at other points.

Sorry if you were hoping for more, but this is it... from Sept.1 to Oct. 11.

I'll be in Kansas on Fri.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Here are a few opportunities to celebrate Thanksgiving with the Second 
Baptist family and make the holiday brighter for those less fortunate in 
our community.

Thanksgiving Services
""It's a Time to Give Thanks!"" - Join the Second Baptist Family as we celebrate 
Thanksgiving with a special worship service filled with music, testimonies 
and a tribute to some of our hometown heroes. Plan to attend one of these 
special services: 

West Campus -Sunday, November 18th at 6 p.m. 

Woodway Campus - Tuesday, November 20th at 6:30 p.m. 

Angels of Light
This is the final weekend (Saturday and Sunday- November 17th & 18th) to 
bring your non-perishable food, wrapped toys or used clothing for Angels 
of Light. 
Don't miss this opportunity to make the holiday season a little brighter 
for someone special. Donations may be dropped off at either campus of Second 
Baptist Church.

Subject: FW: I have learned



I've Learned...... 
I've learned that, no matter what happens, how bad it seems today, life does 
go on and it will be better tomorrow. 

I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she 
handles three things: 
 1. A rainy day, 
 2. Lost luggage, 
 3. Tangled Christmas tree lights. 

I've learned that, regardless of your relationship with your parents, you'll 
miss them when they're gone from your life. 

I've learned that making a ""living"" is not the same thing as making a 
""life."" 

I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance. 

I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on 
both hands. You need to be able to throw something back. 

I've learned that if you pursue happiness, it will elude you. But, if you 
focus on your family, your friends, the needs of others, your work and doing 
the very best you can, happiness will find you. 

 I've learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart, I usually 
make the right decision. 

I've learned that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one. 

I've learned that every day, you should reach out and touch someone. People 
love that human touch - holding hands, a warm hug, or just a friendly pat on 
the back. 

People will forget what you said ... people will forget what you did, but 
people will never forget how you made them feel. 

I've learned that I still have a lot to learn. 

I've learned that you should pass this on to everyone you care about. 

I just did. 

Sometimes they just need a little something to make them smile.

"","Hey Everybody!!!

Justin Zachary Lyons was born on November 5, 2001.  8 lbs 12.5 oz.  He
had his first check up yesterday and is now 9lbs.  ( A chubby buddy just
like his daddy!)

He is a great baby and Hannah is ""adjusting"" to not having moms full
attention every day.

Take Care

Jeff

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Outage:  Telephony Apps IP Switch Replacement
Environments Impacted:  All
Purpose: Replace old 2924 switch (Token Ring config) with 2 new 2948s to minimize the exposure to critical telephony applications in the event of IP switch failure.  New switches can also be added to the Paging System.  Critical telephony applications currently sharing 1 switch include all voice mail.  Loss of network connectivity would prevent anyone from accessing their messages. 
Backout: Revert to old switches.

NEWS RELEASE
FROM THE
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION

Summer 2002 Electricity Forecast Calls Upon
Continued Conservation and New Power Plants
To Get California through Next Summer


The California Energy Commission forecasts that the State
would have adequate supplies of electricity to meet next
summer's electricity demand as long as planned power plants
are built and current levels of conservation continue. The
2002 Monthly Electricity Forecast projected electricity
supplies and demand over the next nine months. While the
report assumes that the market will function normally, price
spikes continue to be a concern if electricity supplies are
tight.

Energy conservation efforts by consumers and businesses
played a critical role in helping the State avoid blackouts
this past summer. Clearly the State's $800 million
investment in energy efficiency including the voluntary
conservation efforts achieved through the Governor's Flex
Your Power public awareness campaign and 20/20 utility
rebate program were key contributors to reducing electricity
demand last summer. An important question in forecasting
electricity demand is how much of last summer's conservation
efforts will continue next summer? If summer 2002
conservation efforts stay the same or decline only
moderately, the State should have adequate electricity
supplies to meet demand.

July may present the most challenging month for the State's
supply and demand balance next summer. The Energy Commission
projects a supply surplus of approximately 340 megawatts
including new generation of 4,000 megawatts expected on line
by July 2002. In an emergency declared by the Independent
System Operator, there are also an additional 1,700
megawatts of electricity that could be available from large
users participating in interruptible/emergency demand
responsive programs.

A key concern continues to be whether there are adequate
electricity supplies for all regions of the State. This
overall statewide supply and demand electricity balance does
not, however, focus on the problem of local area reliability
issues. Problems with transmission line congestion and
generation in a specific region could result in constrained
supplies and local distribution problems.

To meet California's electricity crisis, the Governor
established Emergency Executive Orders that streamlined the
licensing of new power plants and encouraged new generation
from a variety of sources to meet Summer 2001 electricity
demand. Twelve Energy Commission licensed power plants,
including ten simple cycle units, added 2,100 megawatts of
new generation to the State's electricity system this year.
There also was an additional 1,400 megawatts of new
generation available from restarting and/or boosting
generation from existing power plants, adding new renewable
energy facilities, and new power plants that were licensed
by local jurisdictions.

The Joint Legislative Audit Committee requested the
Commission's electricity supply and demand analysis for the
summers of 2002 through 2004. The 2002 Monthly Electricity
Forecast: California Supply/Demand Capacity Balances for
January ? September 2002 and the California Summer
Electricity Outlook for 2002-2004 provide the analysis and
assumptions used in responding to the Committee's request.
The reports will be presented at the Joint Legislative Audit
Committee hearing at 9 a.m. on November 26, 2001.

Both reports are available at the Energy Commission's web
site:

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

"Work Hours","Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

"AOPA ePilot - Class B Advisory","----------------------------------------------------------------------
AOPA ePilot            Special Edition            October 14, 2001
----------------------------------------------------------------------

==> MOST VFR FLIGHTS TO RESUME IN 15 OF 30 ENHANCED CLASS B AREAS <==

Late Saturday night the FAA issued a notam permitting most VFR flight
operations in 15 of 30 enhanced Class B (ECB) airspace areas. The full
text of the notam is provided below. It is less restrictive than
originally thought, and permits VFR operations subject to the
following conditions:

--Aircraft flying inside ECB airspace must have an operating
transponder and squawk VFR code (1200).

--Aircraft without a transponder must obtain a waiver for each
flight from the air traffic control facility responsible for the
ECB airspace.

--Aircraft must monitor the ""guard"" frequency of 121.5 MHz
(if equipped) while flying within ECB airspace.

The notam will become effective at 1100Z (7 a.m. Eastern time) on
Monday, October 15, for Houston, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri;
Memphis, Tennessee; New Orleans, Louisiana; and St. Louis, Missouri.

On Tuesday, October 16, the following ECB airspaces will be opened
at 1100Z (7 a.m. Eastern time): Cleveland, Ohio; Dallas-Ft. Worth,
Texas; Honolulu, Hawaii; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Phoenix, Arizona.

And on Wednesday, October 17, at 1100Z (7 a.m. Eastern time) the
following airspace will be opened to VFR operations: Charlotte,
North Carolina; Cincinnati, Ohio/Covington, Kentucky; Salt Lake City,
Utah; Seattle, Washington; and Tampa, Florida.

The notam will also ask pilots to operate their aircraft in a ""normal""
manner, avoiding circling or loitering. The FAA continues to prohibit
news and traffic reporting flights, sightseeing operations, banner
towing, and airship/blimp operations inside enhanced Class B airspace.
AOPA is continuing to push for the restoration of these flight
operations.

Plans to open the remaining 15 ECB areas are under way, but no
timelines have been established yet. AOPA understands that security
at the airports inside these ECB areas will be key to the return of
VFR operations. Friday afternoon, senior AOPA staff attended a
meeting on groundside security that may eventually play a role in
the release of the second group of ECB areas. Andrew V. Cebula, AOPA
senior vice president of Government and Technical Affairs, discussed
with FAA security officials possible changes that would enable VFR
operations in those areas.

""We won't rest until the last VFR aircraft is flying,"" said AOPA
President Phil Boyer. ""We know some things will change, but our goal
is to restore all general aviation operations to where we were before
the attack while maintaining reasonable levels of security.""

The full text of Saturday night's notam is below. While this is an
official FDC notam, AOPA reminds pilots to check the latest notams
prior to any flight operations. In recent weeks, some notams have
been modified repeatedly or rescinded. AOPA will continue to post
updates promptly on AOPA Online ( http://www.aopa.org/ ).

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"jeep","Hey there!  I went to jeep at lunch.  The guy is giving me a good price on
the car.  However, he is trying to screw me on the price of my car.

He is telling me that the price of the car purchased from the dealership is
as follows...

 Manuf price        $23,668
+sun roof-          $704.00
+destination charge $600.00
+ a few addl charges$364.00
Total price          $25,336


That is pretty consistent with what I show for the price.  Possibly taking
off a few of those fees but that is pretty minimal...

I am thinking that I should sell my car myself...  What do you think.
Please see the attached file.  This is how the guy is trying to screw me.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Neither Mike nor I have interviewed Scott before.  Our connection to Scott came through a very strong recommendation from our West-Power trading desk in Portland.  We are interested in Scott because his west power experience is directly related to the west gas market that Mike and I trade.

I don't mean to be a pain.  If this is unconventional, Mike and I will make seperate arrangements for Scott to meet with us.

Thanks
Keith

Karen,

Mike Grigsby and I would really appreciate being two of the interviewers of Scott on the 29th if that's not to difficult to arrange.

Thanks

X-Mailer: Internet Mail Service (5.5.2653.19)

Here is a message I received from Buddy this morning. I copied it and
deleted all the addresses at top, it was so long. It was sent to him by his
daughter-in-law who works for a law firm in Houston. 

[Sinclair, Nancy] I received this email - thought it was worth passing on 
just in case. 


FYI - I was very skeptical of this e-mail so I called the telephone number 
and it really was Laura Katsis at work.  She said that she did 
write and  send the e-mail in reaction to what her girlfriend told her. 
This could still be a hoax, but I am taking it a little more seriously 
knowing that Laura is a real person who admits writing the e-mail and who
stands behind what she wrote. 
  
Hi All - 
  
I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the 
reactionary thing and send out anything that crosses my path. 
This one, however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough 
credibility in  my mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of 
you.    My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a 
month ago.  She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up.  She was
understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied.  On
9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished he
could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like that.
The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any commercial
airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween.  As soon as
everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since turned
over the letter. 


This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on. This came 
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last 
night.  I may be wrong, and I hope I am.  However, with one of his warnings
being correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the
second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same
information that I did.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

 -----Original Message-----

Subject:	Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage


To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.

By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.

"Confirmation Process","We will be implementing an additional confirm process going forward.  All broker deals will be booked by Risk and placed in TAGG to generate a confirmation.  Before the confirmation is sent to the counterparty, the Enron trader will sign off on the confirm.  All broker deals will be handled this way.

Please generate a new daily summary report of all broker deals by trader in the west region.  This will allow me to verify if the new process is being handled properly.

Anne, please communicate this to your group.

Thanks,
Mike

  <http://a616.g.akamai.net/f/616/94/4h/www.cooking.com/images/newsletters/tg1/transp.gif>	In keeping with the deep-felt sentiments and renewed patriotism of the country, our tribute to Thanksgiving follows a traditional theme this year. Home, family and togetherness - and, most certainly, a holiday feast!

As you begin your preparation, let us help with our suggestions for cooking your turkey and dressing, our finest carving essentials, and our very best tools to simplify tasks.	   <http://a616.g.akamai.net/f/616/94/4h/www.cooking.com/images/newsletters/tg1/transp.gif>

  <http://a616.g.akamai.net/f/616/94/4h/www.cooking.com/images/newsletters/tg1/transp.gif>	Like the diversity of Americans, so, too, are the ways in which families prepare Thanksgiving turkeys. While some stick to the tried-and-true Roast Turkey, some prefer the adventurous route - Wood-Smoked Grilled or Deep-Fried. Here are our suggestions for preparing your bird:	   <http://a616.g.akamai.net/f/616/94/4h/www.cooking.com/images/newsletters/tg1/transp.gif>

Roasting Pan with Rack <http://www.cooking.com/bin/a.asp?a=nwsl1825aa&s=h2>This large Roasting Pan (which accommodates a 25-lb. turkey) offers superior heat conductivity so your bird cooks evenly. Sturdy handles make lifting easier, and the nonstick interior allows for quick cleanup. And with the roasting rack, your turkey won't stew in its drippings.

With its shiny, mahogany skin color, a turkey that's been slowly smoked is something to behold. Once carved, you'll notice that the meat is pinkish in color and the taste - rich and smoky. We highly suggest saving extra slices for making sandwiches the next day!	   <http://a616.g.akamai.net/f/616/94/4h/www.cooking.com/images/newsletters/tg1/transp.gif>

One of the hottest trends, deep-frying your turkey produces a bird that's crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside and not at all greasy! It's a quick alternative - about three minutes of cooking time per pound. Plus, it frees up the oven for pies and sides - a big bonus on this day of oven gridlock!	   <http://a616.g.akamai.net/f/616/94/4h/www.cooking.com/images/newsletters/tg1/transp.gif>

And then there's the choice of stuffing the bird or baking the dressing separately. Cooking it separately saves time. Alternatively, those who stuff the bird say their dressing comes out moister.

See our Must-Have List <http://www.cooking.com/bin/a.asp?a=nwsl1825f&s=h2> to prepare your stuffing.	   <http://a616.g.akamai.net/f/616/94/4h/www.cooking.com/images/newsletters/tg1/transp.gif>

"West New Gen file in dropbox","Keith,

I noticed that a bunch of files have been placed in the folder O:_Dropbox/West New Gen.  They appear to have been created by you. This is the folder that I designated as a dropbox and the entire westpower trading organization uses that folder to look up this report.  If you would like me to move my folder, I will, but it would involve a great number of people and I hope it would be much simpler if I could move your files to a different folder.  Thanks,

Subject: RE: Clarifying my point of view for you......


Point well taken.  I do agree with you that it would have been beneficial
had Keith been able to use Miguel's services for this particular purchase.
However, unfortunately this was not an option.  I do see your point in the
example below.  Although things don't always work out as cut and dry or
quite the way we hope.  Again you are faced with the decision to buy a home
that meets your criteria and you feel is a fair price or keep looking.
Keith has owned a home before in Canada so he is familiar with the process.
However, you are right he is a first time home buyer in the US and I am sure
there are differences between the processes of the two countries not to
mention the changing market, as you pointed out.  Keith did some reasearch
on his own (which would have undoubtedly been more thorough if he were using
the resources and knowledge that is available to a realtor) before making
the decision that this was not only a home that we wanted but also a sound
business investment.  Both of the homes I grew up in were purchased and sold
as private sales and neither turned out to be bad investments for them.  Not
to mention, DeNae and Ricky who have just sold their home and have turned
quite a nice profit on a home they purchased as a private sale.  I agree
that it would ideally be better to use the knowledge and resources of
someone in the real estate industry in the decision making process.
However, I guess my point is that I think that it is possible to make a
sound decision on a home that is sold privately.  I respect your opinion and
I also agree with what you said yesterday that people tend to think
differently about things in life.  Maybe this is one area that we will have
to agree to disagree.  I do appreciate your words though.

Tracy & Keith:

The purchase of your friend's Townhouse in Montrose is perhaps a wonderful
opportunity.  But, my point that I would like to make to you is that I still
feel that you would have benefited from having a professional agent like
Miguel represent you, given that Keith is a first time homebuyer and that
current local market home sales conditions are changing rapidly. If either
one of you were actively engaged in the residential market as a broker,
builder or investor and had experience in buying homes, I would feel very
different about the situation. Having said this, I respect of course your
decision to make whatever choice that you have made even if I disagree. I'm
writing this more for you to understand a very non-emotional business point
of view about the situation.  Also for the two of you to gain a better
understanding of how I feel about the situation.

Let's me use a hypothetical situation.  One that I feel drives home the
point that I'm trying to make:
For example, if Joe wants to sell John his business at a great price, but
says Joe I will only sell you my business, but I will not allow you to hire
your accountant to look review the books, or for you to investigate whether
or not the industry of which that the business is part of is stable, or for
your attorney to do anything but provide form documents for us to fill in
the blanks.

John has a great attorney, great accountant and industry analyst.  He says
to them I want you to help me on buying this business, but Joe here will
only sell the business to me if I don't engage any of you, but to ""just fill
out some forms"".  Will you fill out some forms for me to close the deal.

Reply:  Thanks, but no thanks, I am a professional.

A) I represent people with the best of my ability, and I don't just fill in
the blanks to accommodate someone who is not my client to save him money,
and avoid perhaps other negotiations that should be consider in the
transaction if I'm to represent my client to the best of my ability.
and
B) As a professional, it makes no sense whatsoever to accept the potential
personal liability for such a small payment, under the conditions that
you've placed me to assist you with the transaction.

Friend or not, just because the seller states that he does not want a broker
involved in the transaction does not mean that it is in your best interest.
It could be, but in the end, you are the one that is taking on the most of
the risk, if problems should arise down the road that someone more
experienced could have pointed out for you. In short, the deal closes, the
seller has their money and the transaction is history.

As a business person, I can think of any number of other ways that you guys
might have proceeded with buying his friends house. Make no mistake - I care
about both of you as always, but I was also offended by your approach with
Miguel, in the context of the hypothetical situation that I gave to you
above.  I hope this helps explain things for you as how I feel about the
situation.

After you get settled in, I would love to see the TH.   I know that you are
very excited to finally find a place that both of you like.  I respect that
you have made your choice, and I wish you the very best on a smooth closing
of the house, and many great years together making it a great place to live.



Love,

Elaine

Thanks I appreciate your e mail.  I was not seeking an aplogy from you nor
Miguel and I did not ask for that.  I was only expressing my feelings to
you.  I was under the impression from our previous conversation that you
were upset with the situation and I was looking for us to move forward and
for that process to begin I needed to understand what it was that was
upsetting you.  Maybe I misunderstood our conversation and you were not
upset.  If that is the case then I apologize for misreading your comments to
me on the phone.  You are right life does present choices and I agree that
family is more important then the material and that is why I was bothered
that we would possibly be having problems regarding this issue.

I am always here for you too.  I hope that we can move beyond all of this.

Tracy -  Thanks for writing.  If you are happy that's all that matters. I
can see how you would perhaps make a connection between Keith purchasing a
house, and how it might relate to your relationship and future together.
However, I don't feel an apology is in order from Miguel or me.   After all,
my comments to you were really meant to be taken with the best of intentions
to help Keith, as a first time home buyer, who for months had previously
sought Miguel's advice and assistance.  I think if you reflect on the type
of person that I am, you will understand what I'm saying.  Also, if you
truly believe that a lost commission means more to us than our relationship
with you, I'm truly sorry for that.  Life presents many choices.  I will
always choose to love my family over material things. We are human beings
and people often see things differently . I also accept that as a fact of
life.

As always, if you need me, you can count on me to be there for you.  Life is
too short.  Learn, Grow and Move On.

Love,

Elaine

Subject:	hello

Elaine-

I am very bothered by our earlier conversation and your follow-up e-mail
about Keith's home purchase.  However, I have taken this time to gather my
thoughts before responding.  I feel the best way to convey my feelings are
through this note.  It seems the old adage of not mixing business with
family is becoming an important lesson out of all of this.

First of all, I am very sorry for the way things have worked out.  Keith had
full intentions of finding a home on the MLS that suited his needs and would
have benefited Miguel.  However, we had no way of knowing his friend would
be transferred to London and that he would be selling a home which met our
criteria.  Unfortunately, the seller listed the home privately and was not
willing to use realtors.  Therefore, Keith was faced with a difficult
decision: Pass up a great house at a fair price, or keep looking!

Our conversation has left me feeling that you believe Keith wrongfully
shorted Miguel out of a commission that he had already earned.  I feel this
is an unfair attitude.  Keith did not go behind Miguel's back to negotiate
with someone who was selling a listed home nor did he break an agreement
with Miguel.  Keith truly appreciates the time Miguel spent with us on
several occasions, but he simply found a privately listed house.  It is my
understanding that this is a risk in real estate.  It is not uncommon for a
realtor to spend time with a client who decides either to not buy at all or
finds a privately listed home.  Unfortunately, this is the nature of real
estate and I do not see why Keith should be held to a different standard
because he is like family.

Secondly, I was not only upset by the content of our conversation, but also
the manner in which you acted.  You insisted that Miguel needed to represent
Keith to determine the FMV and then went on to say that it was up to us if
we decide to pay more than the house is worth.  I was bothered by your
insinuation that we are unable to, ""act in an orderly and professional
manner"", and that we are incapable of making a sound investment decision.

I have milled this over in my head a million times trying to understand
where you might be coming from.  While I understand some disappointment at
the loss of a commission, I cannot appreciate the reasons I've imagined you
might have for being upset.  Keith appreciates Miguel's efforts and wishes
things had worked out more favorably for him.  Keith acted in good faith by
offering Miguel the opportunity to facilitate the closing.  He did
understand Miguel's decision to not take part.  However, it came down to the
fact that he had to go with the home that was best for him.

Elaine, I am so sorry if all of this has in any way damaged our
relationships but let me reiterate the fact that Keith and I made this
decision together.  He is someone who is very important to me and in the not
so distant future when we ultimately tie the knot this will be our home
together.  I thought that it was the best decision at the time and I still
feel that it was a good move for him to buy the place.  However, I am
concerned and saddened by what has occurred between all of us.

I hope you know how important both you and Lauren are to me.  You have been
like a big sister. Living in Houston the past five years and getting to be a
part of your lives has been so important to me.  I have treasured getting to
share in your joy of meeting Miguel and having the opportunity for Keith to
get to know all of you as well.  I hope that you know that I would be there
for you and Lauren in a heartbeat.  I just want you to know how I feel about
all that has happened in the past few weeks and I feel that if I call you I
will not get the chance to say all that I am thinking.  I am sorry if you
are upset with the situation and I hope that all four of us will be able to
move on and repair any damage done to our relationship.  I do love you and
Lauren very much.

Vince,

We are searching for an individual to join the west gas trading desk on a temporary basis to lead the development of a comprehensive energy demand model.  Mike Roberts suggested that a member from your research team might be a good fit.

Our vision is to develop a consumption model for the western states (WSCC) which merges factors from natural gas and electricity markets.  This model would consider but may not be limited to: weather, electricity loads, a generation stack and commodity prices (hyrdo, coal, nuclear, oil, etc...), electricity transmission across regions, and predictable non-economic behavior patterns.  This individual would receive extensive exposure to our commercial environment and would have significant support from team members on our desk.

Two members of our team have started this project and I am very excited by the scope and depth that can be achieved with your help.  Please let me know if you are interested.

Sincerely,
Keith Holst

"RE: Rotation on west gas desk","Keith,

I hope that you had a good time in London... Scotland was fantastic. I'm really glad that I got to go before I leave. Speaking of which, I received word from Karen Buckley that I'll be joining West Gas. I must admit, I'm pretty excited about it. I think that my start date will be December 5, although I haven't received any confirmation of that...

See you soon,

-Brent

Going to Scotland for the weekend....Why the hell are you moving back to Houston?  In 2 months you'll be going to Galveston for the weekend.  Anyway, I'm arriving early Friday morning and plan on reaching Enron around 1:00 PM.  If it works for you, lets plan on meeting around 1:30 PM.

Let's do it. The only time requirement I have on Friday is in the afternoon. I'm going to have to blow out of here around 4:00pm to catch a flight to Scotland for the weekend. The rest of day is open.

Looking forward to seeing you.

Brent:

Phillip Allen passed your resume to me.  I would like to discuss the possibilty of you spending your first rotation in Houston with Mike Grigsby and myself on the west natural gas trading desk.  I understand that you are a trading candidate and a rotation on the west desk would fulfill one of the program requirements.  I will be in London November 9th, please let me know if you can spare a few minutes.

Thanks

Subject:	Competitive Analysis Update #26- US Response to Terrorism
Importance:	High


See below for update on situation in Afghanistan as well as fiscal stimulus plans in Congress.

RJ

1. 	The War on the Ground

For the most part, the military action in Afghanistan is likely to be the special forces ""inserted"" into Afghanistan to locate bin Laden. The special forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use the collected intelligence from various sources to ""snatch"" bin Laden and others, or to find other targets, identify them, and then call in attack aircraft.  Such attacks are by now well-priced in and would appear to be unlikely to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets.

Over the weekend, the press picked up on our reports from last week that currently the US has Delta Force, Green Beret, and Army Ranger units on the ground and some special operation forces ""in-country.""  Also,  British Special Air Service units, the French Regiment de Parachutistes d'Infanterie de Marine, and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role. Advance groups of the US 101st and 82nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a week ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan, which is just west of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan, a pass into Afghanistan and to Kandahar. Allied ground troops, backed by helicopter gunships and armored AC-130 armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases near Tashkent in Uzbekistan. 

The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower, ranging from nearly 150 US Air Force B-1 and B-52 bombers and F-16s and F-14s, as well as the nearly 400 aircraft in the four battle carrier groups the US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the USS Carl Vinson, and the USS Kitty Hawk. In addition the British have some 20,000 troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron around the HMS Invincible.

Allied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alliance, the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban.  

Due to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pakistan, the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and the actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a minimum.  Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their intelligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden.

2.	Fiscal Stimulus Outlook
By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus measures totaling somewhere between $100 and $180 billion, if you count the $55 billion in airplane and reconstruction/defense spending already passed. 
Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that tax-cutting gets preference over spending, but that there will have to be some direct spending to anesthetize the center-left crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves are beginning to go raw over corporate ""bailouts"" that have not yet included anything directly for the employees. So for now, here is a brief list of the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospects:
?	Payroll tax cut/suspension -- This has emerged as the most likely item to be on any final list agreed to. As a stimulus item the economics are probably better on this than almost anything else, since it puts money directly in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it can be implemented very quickly. Although it could add up to a very big number if suspended ($700 bn per year), because this is the money that goes into Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be careful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this. Still, both the White House and congressional Dems are big on this. Some version is likely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around $30 bn. 
?	Accelerate the Bush tax cut -- If the original Bush tax cut was the right medicine, then why not have some more? The thinking here is that you have already agreed to do these things, and you no longer are watching the budget flip from black to red, why not put more money in the hands of those who pay the most taxes? The White House has been putting this idea forward, but not too aggressively, and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear that they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than ""the rich."" Chances low, but if there is a broad package, this could get in. 
?	Capital gains tax cut -- This came on fast and has essentially died. It is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities for anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like. Take this one off your list. 
?	Unemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining programs -- These are very big among Democrats and the White House is sympathetic, but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic. There are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way, but the totals being batted around (over $30 billion for the retraining and health care components alone) send the Texas components of House leaders into shock, complaining of socialism. Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promised them support for some serious version of these programs in return for bailing out the airlines without clogging the debate with ""airline worker assistance"" packages (worth about $4 billion). Hastert is saying he will still try to deliver, but his second and third in command are leading an in-house rebellion. 
?	Cut in corporate taxes -- A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be virtually impossible to wrangle through, but a temporary corporate tax cut is something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to achieve. This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about, but if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worker assistance package, they have to swallow hard for something. This was an early favorite of the administration's. As with most of the proposals that seemed so promising when they were first announced, this one has been running into some tough reality. There are a few problems with lower marginal corporate tax rates that have emerged. For one, many large corporations pay on something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule (that's the Alternative Minimum Tax), so they would get no break at all. Even more disturbing is that companies with large tax-loss carryforwards sitting on the books as assets would take a massive hit on the value of these assets, since the calculated benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once. For some weakened companies this alone could be fatal, since their attractiveness to acquirers depends on their loss-carry forwards. Finally, many employee expenses that companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and the value of those deductions would obviously drop. 
?	Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules -- The vast assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by the same problem: just talking about them gives businesses another reason to delay making investments. Even if the administration were to announce that all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed, investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and on which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure. There is no way to propose these without delaying investment. On the plus side, the accelerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation, and can be done for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC. Also, given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward, there may be less concern about the investment postponement issue. This item is likely in some form to make it into a final package, but the details don't exist yet, and its in the details that the significance of it lies. 
?	Specific sectoral tax breaks -- From the steel industry to the restaurant and hotel industry, every trade association has a specific tax break in mind that would help them recover. This is going to be the hardest to handicap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on personal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to make a macro difference. Cumulatively, though, these could easily top $10 billion before the special pleading is done.  Programs like high-speed rail, additional defense money, additional unemployment insurance for hard hit sectors could be shoved into this catch-all rubric. Some of these will make the cut others will not, but they can add up fast. 
?	Fast Track Trade Authority -- USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional leaders that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism, the President would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade deals as necessary. But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democrats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism. If he can recover from the politics of that maneuver, this one actually has some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response -- and it doesn't cost anything.

We will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week since the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in the next. Again, with an end-October deadline, there isn't a lot of time to waste and members of Congress are well aware of that fact.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will ""water out"" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

Subject:	Shut - In costs

I am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for western Canada.  We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shut-ins at a dollar.  I am going to put Steve South and Paul Lucci in charge of presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.  What do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.  Is it as simple as gathering and processing?  

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Grigsby

Subject:	Competitive Analysis Update- US Attacks Afghanistan #2
Importance:	High

Update below on ground campaign strategy & timing, as well as mounting pressures on Saudi and Pakistani governments. Two reports suggest the ground campaign is underway.   There are also press reports about an anthrax case in NYC--we are investigating and will update as soon as possible.

Call with questions.

1.	Afghanistan Ground War Set to Escalate

With a target list thinner than for Kosovo, results from the Afghanistan air campaign five days on have been limited.   But with Taleban fixed defences now softened up, the next phase of search and destroy ground raids, carried out by US and UK special forces and light assault forces, could be imminent.   Insertion will be difficult but various sightings made in recent days suggest to us that the process may have begun.   All our indications are that the US will commit a light division (up to 10,000 troops) and the UK a brigade (about 3,500).   This is a bigger commitment than previously advertised.  More stories along this line may become public over the weekend, even if the Pentagon does not explicitly confirm the action.

Word from Kabul is that Taleban morale is still high and that nightly bombings have prompted some commanders in the Northern Alliance to switch sides, joining the Taleban against the foreign invader.   But outlying Taleban commanders have defected the other way.   There is no clear pattern yet to these changes of allegiance and they may cancel each other out.  And as long as the air strikes remain accurate and clearly targeted against Taleban and bin Laden objectives - which they have been so far - the potential for the Taleban to rally more popular support in Afghanistan seems limited.

When the ground assault starts, from three or four strong points inside Afghanistan, the immediate aim will be to flush out Taleban forces and get them moving so they can be struck from the air.   Such action will be fast and high risk, without much media coverage (with the attendant risk that public support in the US diminishes if the real action is unseen).   If the Taleban can be thus loosened, special forces will then look for Afghans who can take them to the inner core of the Al Qaeda, led by bin Laden and Aymar al Zarawahi.  Depending on how long this takes, there is hope among allied planners that ""reasonable elements"" in the Taleban regime can be detached to form part of a broad-based coalition to run Afghanistan under supervision.   The Northern Alliance on its own is definitely not the answer.

2.	Saudis Feeling Increased Pressure

Refusal by Crown Prince Abdullah to allow Tony Blair to visit Saudi was only one manifestation of current nervousness in the Kingdom.   The tally of small, isolated violent incidents and attacks on Westerners in the interior is beginning to mount.   We have specific information moreover that leading Saudis who have not in the past paid money into Al Qaeda's coffers are now being 'advised' to do so, on grounds that they will not wish to incur Osama bin Laden's future displeasure.

Washington and London say the motivation for Abdullah's decision was well understood but both believe it was a mistake.  The points which Blair would have raised in public have been made by the British Ambassador in Riyadh to his Saudi hosts privately but it was the symbolism of the Prime Minister meeting with the King and the Crown Prince which London and Washington wanted to see.   Blair was particularly galled by Abdullah's blunt refusal to accept the visit when the two men spoke on the phone, particularly as it was the one blot on his most recent schedule of achievement.

3.	Pakistan Holding Steady- For Now

Popular unrest in Pakistan is real but amplified by media coverage.   Even in Peshawar we are told that 'playing to the cameras' has become a distinct element of the protest.   Musharraf meanwhile, having reshuffled top military and intelligence appointees, maintains both his grip and a wary eye on any signs of a split within his own ranks.  Our assessment is that he is controlling the situation - just.

4.	Key Issue for U.S. and Arab allies- Wider War?

There is also a distinct sense in Washington that major decisions are approaching.   This is not just the imminence of ground troops being deployed in Afghanistan, but the much wider question of the stability of Pakistan, the Gulf including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey being put in some jeopardy.   Those who have thought through these issues say they are prepared to risk it.   As long as action against terrorism concentrates on Afghanistan, the leaderships of most of these countries believe the situation will remain manageable.   But if it were to spill over, there could be difficulties for these regimes.

"[NEWSRELEASES-LIST] Energy Commission Begins Review Process for Three ProposedPower Plants","       For immediate release: October 18, 2001
       Media Contact: MaryAnn Costamagna - 916-654-4989 

                     Energy Commission Begins Review
               Process for Three Proposed Power Plants 


       Sacramento - At a business meeting last night, the California Energy Commission accepted into the licensing
       process applications for three new power plants. These projects will now begin a comprehensive staff review.

       Roseville Energy Facility
       A 900-megawatt power plant in the Sacramento area is being proposed by Roseville Energy Facility, LLC, a
       wholly owned subsidiary of Enron North America Corporation. The combined cycle, natural gas-fired facility
       is planned for a site five miles north of downtown Roseville and one-tenth of a mile north of the Pleasant Grove
       Wastewater Treatment Plant.

       The Roseville Energy Facility will be considered under the Energy Commission's 12-month review process
       following last night's 4 to 0 vote by Energy Commissioners. The Committee that will oversee that review is
       comprised of Energy Commissioner Robert Laurie as Presiding Member, and Commission Chairman William
       Keese as Associate Member.

       More information on the Roseville Energy Facility is available on the Energy Commission web site at:

                                   www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/roseville

       Tracy Peaker Project
       As proposed by GWF Energy, LLC, this 169-megawatt, simple cycle power plant would be built in an
       unincorporated part of San Joaquin County, adjacent to the Delta-Mendota Canal on the southwest and the
       Union Pacific railroad to the north.

       Energy Commissioners voted 5 to 0 that the Tracy Peaker Project could begin review under the Energy
       Commission's four-month process. The facility will not be converted to a combined-cycle facility later, due to
       the requirements of a 10-year contract to sell electricity to the California Department of Water Resources
       (DWR).

       Energy Commissioner Robert Pernell was named Presiding Member of the committee reviewing the Tracy
       Peaker Project. Commissioner Robert Laurie will serve as Associate Member.

       More information on the Tracy Peaker Project is available on the Energy Commission web site at:

                                 www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/tracypeaker 

       Henrietta Peaker Project
       GWF Energy, LLC, is also applying for a license to build and operate the Henrietta Peaker Project. The project
       site is adjacent to the PG&E Henrietta substation, 20 miles south of Hanford in an unincorporated part of
       Kings County. The proposed plant would consist of two turbine generators in simple-cycle mode, delivering
       91.4 megawatts, and a 70-kilovolt switchyard. 

       After last night's 5 to 0 vote, Henrietta enters the Commission's four-month review process. Like the Tracy
       project, this facility has an existing 10-year DWR contract that calls for the plant to remain a simple-cycle
       peaking facility. 

       The Committee for the Henrietta Peaker Project consists of Arthur H. Rosenfeld as Presiding Member and
       Commissioner Michal (spelled correctly) Moore as Associate Member.

       More information on the Henrietta Peaker Project is available on the Energy Commission web site at:

                                   www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/henrietta

       Public participation is a very important part of the Energy Commission review process. To find out how to get
       involved, call Roberta Mendonca, the Commission's Public Adviser, at (916) 654-4489, toll free at (800)
       822-6228, or by e-mail at [pao@energy.state.ca.us].

10. TRAVEL CONSUMERS' GUIDE TO BANKRUPTCY
    by Anita Dunham-Potter, Contributing Travel Editor

As the travel industry continues to stagger to its feet, it remains
unclear just how many airlines, cruise lines, and hotels will still
be standing when all is said and done. Whatever the outcome, travel
consumers will become painfully aware of a term called bankruptcy.

11. BEST BARGAINS ARE IN THE CARDS--BUT WHICH ONE?
    by Christopher Elliott
   
Reservations agents at hotels, car rental companies, and tour
operators don't always ask if you belong to a club or organization
that may entitle you to save money. It's a little bit like playing
poker. You have to know which cards to leave on the table and which
ones to keep in your pocket.

FAA puts onus on National Security Council
AOPA asks Congress for help
Pittsburgh flight school wins $10,000 prize
AOPA members now have flight tracking capability

Restoring GA
	
FEDS FREE FIRST OF 41,000 STRANDED AIRPLANES
Most VFR pilots near five major cities were able to take to the air last Monday morning, following the release of a notam late Saturday night. Five more cities were opened Tuesday and an additional five on Wednesday. ""AOPA's staff has been working almost 24 hours a day to achieve this first goal,"" said AOPA President Phil Boyer. ""The efforts of AOPA members, along with other general aviation organizations, have helped to free the first of the GA 41,000."" A special edition of ePilot was sent early Sunday to pilots in and near the affected areas. AOPA's staff will be focusing now on restoring flight privileges in the remaining 15 enhanced Class B areas and the Washington and New York temporary flight restriction areas (TFRs). AOPA is also working toward gaining approval for news and traffic reporting, banner towing, ! and sightseeing operations to resume operations in enhanced Class B (ECB) airspace.

FAA PUTS ONUS ON NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL
An FAA representative told the House aviation subcommittee Wednesday that while the agency is working on plans to reopen the 15 remaining ECB areas, they can't do so without concurrence from the National Security Council and the Department of Defense. This clarifies the much disputed question as to who is making the decisions regarding the reopening of ECB to VFR traffic. Steve Brown, FAA associate administrator of air traffic services, received pointed questions from members of the committee. He said that the FAA has been working hard with members of the general aviation industry, such as AOPA, to remove the restrictions. But committee members believe the lifting of such restrictions should have come long ago. North Carolina congressman and AOPA member Robin Hayes said to Brown, ""Just fix the problem, will ya?""

NSC CONSIDERS PROPOSALS 
The National Security Council met Thursday to consider FAA plans for restoring operations in the remaining 15 ECB areas. The FAA's presentation considered recommendations made by a coalition of general aviation groups for easing restrictions on VFR flying. AOPA, EAA, GAMA, HAI, NATA, NBAA, and NASAO developed consensus recommendations addressing aircraft and airport security and airspace operations.

AOPA ASKS CONGRESS FOR HELP
AOPA again Wednesday reminded Congress that the airspace around 15 major cities remains closed to VFR pilots. ""The problem is not yet solved. With each day that passes, some 65,000 pilots and nearly 21,000 aircraft at 132 airports, and the businesses that support them, continue to be affected in 15 areas. These VFR operations must be restored,"" said Andy Cebula, AOPA senior vice president of Government and Technical Affairs, testifying before the House aviation subcommittee. In addition to the business losses caused by the continuing restrictions, Cebula said that individual aircraft owners were facing average fixed costs of $2,400 a month whether the aircraft flies or not. See AOPA Online <http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/newsitems/2001/01-4-044x.html>.

CONGRESSMEN INTRODUCE VFR RESTORATION BILLS
House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Don Young (R-Alaska) introduced Wednesday aviation security legislation that includes a provision that requires that any notam, regulation, or order that restricts the ability of Part 91 aircraft to conduct operations in ECB airspace shall cease to be in effect 10 days after the bill is passed. This provision is similar to the bill also introduced Wednesday by Rep. Bob Filner (D-Calif.) that would require the FAA to develop a plan to allow VFR flight in the remaining 15 ECB areas where it is currently prohibited. Filner said his legislation ""requires the FAA to have a specific timeline for opening up these closed airports. National security is paramount, but we must also find a way to allow this backbone of American transportation to resume flying.""

FAA MAY GRANT PROFICIENCY, INSPECTION EXTENSIONS
As a follow-up to informal discussions with FAA officials, AOPA formally requested that pilots and aircraft owners directly affected by the enhanced Class B flight restrictions and the TFRs be given relief from the regulations governing instrument proficiency, flight reviews, and certain aircraft inspections. In particular, AOPA asked that the FAA extend the due date to November 30 for those whose pilot proficiency or aircraft inspections were due on or after September 30. Relief was also requested on behalf of our military personnel serving overseas. The FAA recently told AOPA that granting the requested relief was possible with certain modifications. A final decision is expected early next week. See AOPA Online <http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/newsitems/2001/01-4-026x.html>.

SAN DIEGO CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO CONTROL AIRPORT
AOPA's two-year-long opposition to a privatization plan for San Diego's Brown Field Municipal Airport succeeded when the City Council voted unanimously to maintain local control of the airport. It will help secure the future of general aviation at Brown Field. The field was one of five airports nationwide scheduled to be privatized-that is, sold or leased to a private developer-under a congressionally ordered demonstration program. But the plan for Brown Field would have harmed GA. See AOPA Online <http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/newsitems/2001/01-3-166x.html>.

FAA GOES AFTER CITY FOR $50,000 LANDING FEES
The FAA set last Saturday as the deadline for the town of Islip, New York, to drop a recently enacted $50,000 nighttime landing fee at Long Island-Mac Arthur Airport. The fee violates a federal funding agreement prohibiting unjust discrimination. As recently as early September, AOPA said the town ""ignored us"" when asked on several occasions to discuss nighttime curfew issues. See AOPA Online <http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/newsitems/2001/01-4-020x.html>.

PILOTS ARE SOUGHT TO TEST FSS ENHANCEMENTS 
The FAA is seeking volunteers to participate in a research program involving the aviation digital data system (ADDS). The test, to be conducted at the FAA's William J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, will study the potential for conducting interactive weather briefings for pilots utilizing the flight service system. The program will take place from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. from November 6 through 8. Pilots need only participate for one of the days, and no prior experience with the system is needed. This is an opportunity to be involved in an important safety and service enhancement for the general aviation community. AOPA has been a long-time advocate of providing official weather information over the Internet. AOPA staff members will also be participating in the study to evaluate future member benefits.

Airport Support Network
	
ASN WORKS TO SAVE NATION'S AIRPORTS
Every day more than 1,000 AOPA Airport Support Network volunteers work with AOPA headquarters on a local level to help save their airports. That's a lot, but not enough. Ask yourself these questions: Has my flying been affected by development, new restrictions, or negative public relations about my local airport? Have local issues or political pressures affected my use and the efficiency of my local airport? If the answer is ""yes"" to either question, you may be just the kind of person we're looking for to help ensure the health and availability of your airport.


  _____  

ASN is looking for volunteers at several airports-including, in Arkansas, 1M1, ASG, AWM, BVX, and HOT; Louisiana, 3R7, ARA, HDC, HUM, and L38; New Mexico, ABQ, ALM, CVN, E80, and HOB; Oklahoma, 0F8, 1F0, ADH, AVK, and BVO; and Texas, 00R, 1F9, 3R1, 50R, and 5R5.

Here's a question asked by an AOPA member last week of our AOPA technical specialists. Test your knowledge.

Question: I have just received a letter of investigation from the FAA for a flight into the enhanced Class B airspace. They are saying that I wasn't authorized to be in that area. What should I do?

Answer: AOPA staff has talked with a number of pilots who have received letters and inquiries from the FAA, stemming from the wide range of interpretations of the many notams published by the FAA since the events of September 11. If you receive a letter of investigation or other inquiry from the FAA, you should contact one of our aviation technical specialists (800/USA-AOPA) immediately to learn more about the enforcement process. Members who are enrolled in the AOPA Legal Services Plan will have access to legal advice to address their concerns. Click here <http://www.aopa.org/info/certified/lsp.html> for more on the plan.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Subject:	West Fundies

Mike,

Following is a west fundies update.  We have not yet produced an abundance of finished product, but several great projects are in the development stage.  These projects are making nice progress even though it may not be visible to the casual observer.

PRODUCTION

This effort is being led by Tori and supported by both Jay and myself.  Gaskill's staff will be providing most of the manpower.  The concept is to design a model which takes a methodical and scientific approach in forecasting: (1) declines of existing production,  (2) increases due to drilling. 

Existing production

Using externally provided production data, we are in the process of dividing production into zones of like characteristics.  Each zone will be identified by: Basin --> Reservoir --> Formation.  Analysis will be done at the zone level to determine its unique depletion curve.  This curve will be extrapolated to forecast future production from existing wells.

New production

From rig count data (or completion data if we buy the more expensive database) we can determine which ""zone"" a new well is targeting.  Forecasted production can then be determined by applying a recent historical success ratio and the corresponding depletion curve identified in the preceding step.  The difficult component to forecast with great accuracy is future drilling.  Our current thinking is a calculation that considers forward prices, drilling costs (which are increasing since all the ""easy wells"" have already been drilled), and common required rates of return.

Unresolved

Determining the specific plants which will be affected by depletions and new drilling is an unresolved issue.  The reciepient plant for new drilling may be identified in public records or we may be able to use rig coordinates to determine the closest and most likely plant.  Depletions may be more difficult as I am unsure if the well data can be readily cross-referenced with the corresponding plants.

DEMAND

This effort is being led by Mat Smith and supported by Jason Huang and myself.  Our near-term goals are to refine the existing California model and to develop similar models for the PNW, DSW, and RM.

Jason Wolfe is facilitating data collection and interpretation for the PNW.  I will likely recruit Billianna to follow suit in the DSW.  Jason Huang is moving to Gaskill's group, however, he will still have some involvement in this project.  I still intend on recruiting an individual from the research group, but feel that it is best to have the other regions ""framed"" (ie: model built) prior to bringing that person aboard.  His role will be to refine our technique and mathematics.

Data collection and interpretation

Much of the needed data is already in place, however some work remains.  Our existing NWPL histories consist of a handfull of compressor flows; demand is calculated by subtracting the downstream flow from the upstream flow.  This ""rough""  method works, but the downsides are: (1) this calculated number includes changes in line pack and therfore true demand is hidden; (2) we are forced to break NWPL into arbitrary regions determined by the placement of compressors.  Jason W. is working on collecting flows at every meter on the pipe.  This will afford a much more accurate reading of true demand devoid of linepack changes and significantly better regression analysis will result.  Jason is also looking at a more meaningful way of dividing the pipe into demand zones.

El Paso's system does not provide flows at individual meters, but we have recently discovered that several years of actual flows for pre-determined zones are available.  (Phoenix area, Tucson area, and El Paso City area).  Monique was working on uploading this data into our database.  I think Bilianna can pick up where Monique left off.

An ongoing process will be to drill into the various demand zones to gain a better understanding of specific drivers of that demand.  ie: weather sensitive load, industrial load and related economic factors, etc...

PNW, DSW, and RM regression analsysis

Two hurdles have prevented us from moving forward on this front.  First, the data collection discussed above-- this process should be complete within two weeks.  Second, our intention is to use Portland's power demand forecasts as a variable in our gas demand models.  Mat Smith needs to visit Portland to gain a comprehensive understanding of these load forecasts.  He has a trip scheduled for the end of October.

Provided things go according to plan, we should have ""rough"" models in place by mid-November.  At that time I will look to bring a research person aboard.

"Progress on the NewDeal Model","Keith:  I made progress on the model.  All of the data pulls in from EOL and hedge strips.  The other pieces should go smoothly.  Unfortunately, I have class tomorrow starting at 8:30.  I will work on it in the morning and after class.

Take a look at what I have so far and let me know what you think.

Thanks

Anne

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

10. CAN THEY KICK ME OFF A FLIGHT?

A flight attendant claims she was bumped by a passenger's bag,
then removes that passenger for not apologizing. Can she do that?
Christopher Elliott responds in ""The Travel Troubleshooter,"" and
says the real issue may be carry-on luggage.

FAA OPENS MOST CLASS B AIRSPACE TO VFR

AOPA KEEPS FOCUS ON REMAINING CITIES, SPECIALTY OPERATIONS
The FAA on Sunday afternoon released a notam announcing the phased reopening of 12 more ""enhanced Class B"" (ECB) areas to most VFR operations. Last week, most VFR flights were allowed to resume in 15 other ECB areas. This leaves three metropolitan areas-New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Boston-where VFR remains prohibited.

""This is an important milestone and fantastic news for VFR pilots,"" said AOPA President Phil Boyer. Restoring VFR flight in ECB airspace has been an AOPA priority for weeks. ""But now our focus must turn to restoring operations in the three remaining metropolitan areas and in getting the news and traffic reporters, banner towers, and other specialty operators back in the air everywhere.""

Much like the release of airspace last week, this release will be phased in over three days. The first five will be reopened on Monday. The opening will follow the schedule below:

Monday, October 22, at 1100Z (7 a.m. Eastern time): Atlanta, Georgia; Las Vegas, Nevada; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida, and San Francisco, California.

Tuesday, October 23, at 1100Z (7 a.m. Eastern time): Denver, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and San Diego, California.

Wednesday, October 24, at 1100Z (7 a.m. Eastern time): Chicago, Illinois, and Orlando, Florida.

The procedures for these cities are the same as those established for the 15 areas opened last week. Aircraft flying in enhanced Class B (ECB) airspace must have an encoding transponder and squawk 1200 (or as assigned by ATC). Aircraft without a transponder must get a waiver from ATC for each flight in ECB airspace. If equipped to do so, pilots flying in ECB airspace should monitor the guard frequency of 121.5 MHz. The notam also asks pilots to operate their aircraft in a ""normal"" manner, avoiding aerobatics as well as circling or loitering. 

See AOPA's ""frequently asked questions <http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/newsitems/2001/011019faq.html>"" for more information on rules applicable to enhanced Class B airspace.

The full text of Sunday's notam is below. While this is an official FDC notam, AOPA recommends that pilot check the latest notams prior to any flight operations. In recent weeks, some notams have been modified repeatedly or rescinded. AOPA will continue to post updates promptly on AOPA Online <http://www.aopa.org/>.

The project status hearing is being held to review the status of proceeding, the timeliness of Applicant data submissions, and the schedule for the remainder of the Application for Certification proceeding.

EL Segundo Power II LLC (ESP II), is seeking approval to replace the existing El Segundo Generating Station (ESGS) Units 1 and 2 natural gas-fired, combined cycle electric generation facility. ESGS Units 3 and 4 located adjacent to Units 1 and 2 will not be modified by this project. The new facility is expected to generate 630-megawatts (MW) under nominal conditions. The project includes demolition and removal of the existing Units 1 and 2 and replacement with Units 5, 6, and 7 in the location previously occupied by Units 1 and 2.

The public is encouraged to participate and will have the opportunity to provide comments and ask questions during the hearing. Persons requiring information on how to participate in the Energy Commission's review of the proposed project should contact Roberta Mendonca, the Energy Commission's Public Adviser, at (916) 654-4489 or toll free in California at (800) 822-6228, or by e-mail at pao@energy.state.ca.us.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

Community Calendar Announcement


October 26, 2001 

Dear Editor/Publisher: 

If your publication, radio or television station offers a calendar of community events, you may want to include news of
the following hearing. 

The Committe overseeing the Application for Certification for the proposed Valero Cogeneration Project will hold a
committee conference and evidentiary hearing as follows: 

                                       TUESDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2001
                                             Beginning at 3 p.m.
                                              Benicia City Hall
                                              Commission Room
                                              250 East L Street
                                              Benicia, California
                                            (Wheelchair Accessible)

Subject: RE: hello


Tracy -  Thanks for writing.  If you are happy that's all that matters. I
can see how you would perhaps make a connection between Keith purchasing a
house, and how it might relate to your relationship and future together.
However, I don't feel an apology is in order from Miguel or me.   After all,
my comments to you were really meant to be taken with the best of intentions
to help Keith, as a first time home buyer, who for months had previously
sought Miguel's advice and assistance.  I think if you reflect on the type
of person that I am, you will understand what I'm saying.  Also, if you
truly believe that a lost commission means more to us than our relationship
with you, I'm truly sorry for that.  Life presents many choices.  I will
always choose to love my family over material things. We are human beings
and people often see things differently . I also accept that as a fact of
life.

As always, if you need me, you can count on me to be there for you.  Life is
too short.  Learn, Grow and Move On.

Love,

Elaine

Subject:	hello

Elaine-

I am very bothered by our earlier conversation and your follow-up e-mail
about Keith's home purchase.  However, I have taken this time to gather my
thoughts before responding.  I feel the best way to convey my feelings are
through this note.  It seems the old adage of not mixing business with
family is becoming an important lesson out of all of this.

First of all, I am very sorry for the way things have worked out.  Keith had
full intentions of finding a home on the MLS that suited his needs and would
have benefited Miguel.  However, we had no way of knowing his friend would
be transferred to London and that he would be selling a home which met our
criteria.  Unfortunately, the seller listed the home privately and was not
willing to use realtors.  Therefore, Keith was faced with a difficult
decision: Pass up a great house at a fair price, or keep looking!

Our conversation has left me feeling that you believe Keith wrongfully
shorted Miguel out of a commission that he had already earned.  I feel this
is an unfair attitude.  Keith did not go behind Miguel's back to negotiate
with someone who was selling a listed home nor did he break an agreement
with Miguel.  Keith truly appreciates the time Miguel spent with us on
several occasions, but he simply found a privately listed house.  It is my
understanding that this is a risk in real estate.  It is not uncommon for a
realtor to spend time with a client who decides either to not buy at all or
finds a privately listed home.  Unfortunately, this is the nature of real
estate and I do not see why Keith should be held to a different standard
because he is like family.

Secondly, I was not only upset by the content of our conversation, but also
the manner in which you acted.  You insisted that Miguel needed to represent
Keith to determine the FMV and then went on to say that it was up to us if
we decide to pay more than the house is worth.  I was bothered by your
insinuation that we are unable to, ""act in an orderly and professional
manner"", and that we are incapable of making a sound investment decision.

I have milled this over in my head a million times trying to understand
where you might be coming from.  While I understand some disappointment at
the loss of a commission, I cannot appreciate the reasons I've imagined you
might have for being upset.  Keith appreciates Miguel's efforts and wishes
things had worked out more favorably for him.  Keith acted in good faith by
offering Miguel the opportunity to facilitate the closing.  He did
understand Miguel's decision to not take part.  However, it came down to the
fact that he had to go with the home that was best for him.

Elaine, I am so sorry if all of this has in any way damaged our
relationships but let me reiterate the fact that Keith and I made this
decision together.  He is someone who is very important to me and in the not
so distant future when we ultimately tie the knot this will be our home
together.  I thought that it was the best decision at the time and I still
feel that it was a good move for him to buy the place.  However, I am
concerned and saddened by what has occurred between all of us.

I hope you know how important both you and Lauren are to me.  You have been
like a big sister. Living in Houston the past five years and getting to be a
part of your lives has been so important to me.  I have treasured getting to
share in your joy of meeting Miguel and having the opportunity for Keith to
get to know all of you as well.  I hope that you know that I would be there
for you and Lauren in a heartbeat.  I just want you to know how I feel about
all that has happened in the past few weeks and I feel that if I call you I
will not get the chance to say all that I am thinking.  I am sorry if you
are upset with the situation and I hope that all four of us will be able to
move on and repair any damage done to our relationship.  I do love you and
Lauren very much.

Tracy

"New Deal Check out Model","Keith:  I made a ton of progress on the NewDeal Model over the weekend and tonight. I resolved all of the issues we discussed on Friday.  In other words all of the positions pull from the hedge strips correctly, and the EOL data pulls in correctly.  I am working on the other tabs that we will need, including the New Broker deals and New EOL tabs.  The data is all there, I just need to get it to display in the common format.

Can you schedule 30 minutes after trading on Tuesday to discuss.  I will have a model for you to test.

Thanks

Anne
