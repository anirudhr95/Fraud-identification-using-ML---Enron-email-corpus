"RE: Day Ahead ""Financial"" Parking/Lending product","You are right.  There are no delivery/scheduling obligations on the day ahead DART product (unlike the regular day-ahead).  Yes.  A DART onpeak would mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day, and a DART offpeak would mean delivery on all offpeak hours for the corresponding day.

Hi Sean,

I'm trying to understand the mechanics of this product. If I understand correctly the only difference between day ahead and the DART product is that it does not get scheduled for delivery until the delivery day. Also a DART trade for the 3rd would mean delivery for all peak hours on the 3rd?

Kevin,

My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how the Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like real-time is a success, so let's get going with this.  

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on real-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a ""US Pwr Phy Firm  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART""  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the party selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each hour.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I would be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transaction.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow such that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions that needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following language to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal review).

""This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delivery on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-time means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consistent with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices.""

Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.

Sean,

The language is below.  Also, Savita wanted to conference call you this afternoon to discuss this product.  What time is good for you?

Kevin

A US Power Transaction with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. under which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall purchase a quantity of firm energy equal to the Hourly Quantity at the Contract Price. The Contract Price shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Web Site.  ""Firm energy"" is power that is or will be scheduled as firm energy consistent with the most recent rules adopted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council for which the only excuses for failure to deliver or receive are if an interruption is (i) due to an Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of the WSPP Agreement; or (ii) where applicable, to meet Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.  Notwithstanding any other provision in the underlying agreement between the Seller and the Buyer that governs this transaction (the ""Agreement""), if Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public utility or statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment of damages for failure to deliver firm energy as provided in the applicable cover remedy section(s) of the Agreement.  ""WSPP Agreement"" means the Western System Power Pool Agreement as amended from time to time.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery or receipt of power at Mid Columbia.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the ""Hourly Quantity').
The transaction is for on-peak (""Peak"") hours on each Delivery Day beginning with the hour ending 0700 (6:00 am) and concluding with the hour ending 2200 (10:00 pm) Pacific Prevailing Time.  ""Delivery Day"" means a day during the term of the transaction that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday, excluding any day that is a NERC holiday.

Subject:	Day Ahead ""Financial"" Parking/Lending product

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL legal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, but I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For example, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but that it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forward to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EOL, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical power, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead position.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would appreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we need to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.

Let's talk about the RTO meetings when we get more information from FERC.  If the entire week is only going to be a panel format, I don't think it will be a very good use of Tim's or Sean's time.  In a panel setting, only the panelists are permitted to speak, and the audience can listen only -- participation from the audience is usually not allowed.  
 
Once we get more information from FERC and find out the exact format, we can then make final plans.

"Introductions","Bruce,

I haven't had an opportunity to call you directly yet, so I thought I would e-mail you first and sort of lay out the circumstances.

I've been a short-term trader with Enron for about 4 years -- I run our short-term Northwest book.  Prior to that, I cash traded for Portland General for a couple of years.  My contract with Enron is up July 31, and I have a 3-month non-compete obligation.  Theoretically, the earliest I could leave Enron would be May 31, so the earliest I could start with another shop would be Sept 1.

To be honest, at this point I'm shopping.  I'm talking to a couple of other outfits and I basically want to see what sort of interest there is out there.  I talked with Matt, and he mentioned you, so I thought it might be a good idea to get in touch.  If you are interested in pursuing anything further, please e-mail me and we'll arrange a time we can talk over the phone.

Thanks,

Sean

"Re: TTC/ATC with the attachment!!","This gets even better.  On Tuesday, April 3, I had our California prescheduler ask the ISO Day Ahead personnel why the COB S/N ATC had been decreased so much.  There reply was that the ATC is calculated by taking the TTC less Existing Transmission Contracts less FTRs less Capacity Benefit Margin.  Normally, and up until January 1 of this year, they haven't used a Capacity Benefit Margin when calculating ATC leaving the state.  So the amount of ATC they had at COB S/N is normally in the 700 to 800 MW range, rather than the 35 to 60 MW of ATC they are using now.

We asked what this Capacity Benefit Margin was, and they said it's not in their tariff, it's in the NERC Operating Manual.  I went to the NERC web site, and sure enough, Capacity Benefit Margin is a defined term.  It reads : ""Capacity Benefit Margin is the amount of TTC reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements"".

The ISO's use of this language is outrageous.  This is language to ensure that load has transmission access to remote generation.  I can see them using this argument with respect to COB N/S but no way COB S/N!!  In fact, one could very easily argue that they are VIOLATING this criteria.  If we have load in the Northwest, and have purchased generation in California, we should have access to available transmission.

Subject:	Teams for Upcoming FERC Proceedings


As you know, the Commission last week issued several important notices and papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to address over the next few months.  These issues are extremely important to Enron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve (most) of these issues for many years.  There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act, and we need to be ready to respond.  

In an effort to coordinate our efforts, we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives.  The Washington advocacy group will also work closely with all of these teams.  If someone is interested in a particular issue and was not included on that team, please feel free to call the Project Lead to have your name added to the team.  All assistance is welcome.  As you will see on the attached chart, many of the deadlines for responding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks, so the teams need to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly.

On the attached chart, we have listed in the left column each of the FERC initiatives that will be starting or are currently underway.  A ""Project Lead"" has been named for each initiative.  The Project Lead will be responsible for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in the proceeding.  The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the next couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward.  The team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues should be addressed, what is the best way for Enron to respond to them, and producing draft comments.  Once draft comments are prepared, the comments will be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enron's important issues.  

There is a column of ""Inside Counsel"" and ""Outside Services.""  In some areas, we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not.  Where we do not list outside counsel, we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments (with significant input from the team members).  Please remember, however, that even if outside services are listed, the RCR process must still be followed.  If applicable, Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible.
The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lead named for each proceeding:

RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR:  Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding.  The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October 15-19, and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels.  Comments will be submitted to FERC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs.  This team will also be responsible for these comments.

Standards of Conduct NOPR:  Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead.  Comments are due in approximately 45 days.  Several issues are raised in this proceeding, including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utility's marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load.  This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal.

ICAP Inquiry:  Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead.  Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements, whether they are needed, and what impact such requirements have on the market.  Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years, and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed.  We will submit expert testimony on this issue.
California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation:  Alan Comnes will be the Project Lead.  Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO.  Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be, we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible.  Furthermore, a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures.  The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California.  California's summer peaking season is over, but the Pacific Northwest's winter peaking season will be starting soon, and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest, where it will be needed this winter.  This team will be responsible for both of these proceedings.
Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues:  Steve Walton is the Project Lead.  FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints - California's Path 15 and the Central East Interface in New York  -- and plans to have the study completed later this year.  The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE.  The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it.  In a relating proceeding, the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues.  The team will also oversee the progress in these proceedings.
Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements:  Susan Lindberg is the Project Lead.  The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required, including at least seven additional data points per transaction.  This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.  Comments are due on October 5.
California Refund Proceeding:  Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead.  The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact.  
Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding:  Bob Frank is the Project Lead.  The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest.  Briefs will be filed in response to the decision, and the Commission will review the Judge's order.  
Midwest/Alliance RTO Proceeding:  Mike Roan is the Project Lead.  Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest - the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO.  Enron is advocating, consistent with the Commission's recent pronouncements, one single RTO in the Midwest.  The Commission is expected to act on these filings shortly.  Proceedings may be ordered.
Northeast RTO Proceeding:  Sarah Novosel is the Project Lead.  Mediation to create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before October 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.
Southeast RTO Proceeding:  Christi Nicolay is the Project Lead.  Mediation to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before October 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.

For those people wanting to learn more about Var calculation and application, I've put a copy of JP Morgan's RiskMetrics documentation on the P: drive under \MidMarketing\RiskMetrics. Of the five documents, Part 2 probably gets most directly at the questions that were being asked in Matt's seminar.

"RE: Hi","Hey,

You sound kind of bummed out there, amiga.  Understandable though.  Tough and very weird times that's for sure.  Very sad.  The funerals must have been brutal.  I know I'm depressed by it because I get these waves of sadness that hit me out of the blue periodically.  Hopefully things will improve.

Our stock has just been munched.  It sucks because we're doing well, but the other ""half"" of the company appeared to be mostly smoke and mirrors.  Everyone was wondering why Skilling left; I guess we know why now.

Enough of the gloom and doom.  Sounds like you are getting opportunities--that's good.  I knew that you would.  Here's some pros/cons for your options (recalling my vast experience;))  Structuring:  Interesting but not alot of dough.  Probably the most easily replaced by those fresh MBAs.  Trading:  Like being handcuffed to a schizophrenic on speed.  Can turn you into a frothing mass of neurosis at times.  Good dough if you make it though.  Marketing:  Low immediate, constant stress, but still competitive.  You have a great deal of charm and brains, so I think you would do quite well in this area.  In addition, there are a number of firms (Calpine, AEP, Coral) who are opening up an office in Portland pretty much geared towards mid-marketing.  Might be opportunity down the road for you to move closer to home (plus you can buy me beer, which is always a plus for anyone's karma).

As far as your overall attitude towards the industry, I think I disagree.  I think it's a good industry to be in, particularly now, because no matter what, people need electricity.  And it's still changing, especially out West, so there will be challenges and opportunities.

It's great talking with you.  Cheer up.  Call your folks.  Run.  Punch a punching bag.  Do drugs (kidding).  Take care of yourself, and if you need anything, give me a buzz or drop an email.

Sean

Hi Sean, how are things going? I'm jealous about your trip to Europe. I
called you shortly after you returned from the trip and you filled me in on
your castle experience. I would love to do that someday. I had no idea you
were talking to Duke, I hope you got what you wanted and deserve from Enron,
your a great guy, and a good trader I hope they realize that. Life over here
on the east coast is interesting, first it was the attacks of the eleventh,
I took one week off from work and attended 6 funerals in NYC, it was
extremely sad. There were even people from my graduating class from Calgary
that worked in NY, I was shocked at how far reaching the effects were. Right
now we're just trying to live through and survive these biological attacks,
I live close to the white house and the mall, so I figure if anything big
happens I'll go quickly. Are people this messed up in the world, that all
they can think about is spreading pain, suffering, and death. What have we
come to? Sorry, just really philosophical today with all the TV's talking
about Anthrax over and over behind me. Work wise things are well, I'm at a
juncture here where the trading team is asking me if I would like to trade,
structuring is wondering if I'd like to do that full time, and with my
mid-marketing role and contacts, marketing wants me to become a full fledged
marketer, the trouble is I don't know what to do, I'm trying to delay the
decision as long as I can. I really have no regrets at PGET, the people are
great, the work is challenging, and they treat me well. But lately I'm
starting to feel very bearish on the whole industry. I can't tell you where
I'd want to go, when, or what industry I'm optimistic about, but I can't get
too excited on power right now. Anyway, take care, drop a line sometime.
later alligator

The 600 and 725 are guaranteed, yes.  I didn't mean to imply Cinergy wouldn't pay out; I meant more i'm basically comparing startup prospects with established company/operations prospects.  Startup prospects are, I think, more risky.

Also, I realize there are distinct advantages from living in Houston.  My ""reluctance"" is more of a family/moving type of thing.  It is an issue, but not a huge one.

Thanks for the update.  I will forward this information.  I assume that the
low numbers are guaranteed that no matter what happens to you or the company
you will receive the min amount.  Is that true?  As far as Cinergy having a
payout record- it does.  The bonus plan pays out 17% of profits, I don't
think there is any other company paying that kind of money.  They paid on it
last year.  However, the P&L has to be there, but the money was distributed.
Also they pay on NPV of the deals so accounting doesn't enter into
performance.  I think that is unique as well.

As far as Houston goes, I can show you parts of the city that are beautiful
and the commute is easy with lots of great neighborshood at tremendous
value.  I'm 15 minutes from every venue (sport, education, theatre, musuems)
in the fourth largest city in America.  In addition, your family will not be
trapped to one employer.  I lived in a few places and visited numerous
others, I think its the best value city in the country.  In addition, with
the kind of money you will be making there is no state income in Texas.  And
being in the energy trading business, it has no peer.

Subject: RE:


Down to brass tacks, eh?  This is always the interesting part.  Quite
frankly Bruce, it's a pretty good job market.  Basically I'm looking at two
other prospects.  The first will require me to sign a 2-year contract, the
second will not.  The base component with the first is going to be around
$275/year.  The second is going to be around $250/year.   As far as
incentive bonus goes, I'm looking at about a minimum of $450 for the first
to about a max of $750.  At the second I'm looking at a min of about $350
to about a max of $900.  So over a one year period, we're looking at about
$725 to $1.025M for prospect 1, and $600 To $1.15M for prospect 2.

In terms of location, both prospect 1 and 2 are in attractive locations for
me.  Prospect 1 is in a VERY attractive location.  To be honest, I'm not a
big buyer of Houston, so I have to factor that into the equation.
Secondly, both prospects are big, well entrenched players, so I'm pretty
confident of the above numbers.  While I'm pretty excited about the
prospects of being on the ""ground floor"" with Cinergy, I also have to
recognize Cinergy doesn't have a P&L track record for me to assess the
probability of the incentive payout.  For that reason, I think, I would
require a fairly large guaranteed number the first year, while still
participating in Cinergy's incentive program.  The second year I would be
willing to renegotiate the guaranteed number if we had our feet underneath
us and it looked like we had the room to prove ourselves and generate some
serious money for the company.

Given what you guys have in mind, I honestly think I can help you achieve
your goals more quickly, and with less risk.  I also think there is serious
money to be made with the right team--I've seen it happen at Enron.

No matter what happens, I appreciate you taking the time.  Please also
extend my thanks to everyone I had the opportunity to meet in Cincinnati.

Subject: spoke too soon


Unfortunately i am too late to halt my last email. Perspective comes quickly
at 8000 meters and today, thinking back on the ascent and all the rock
climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my
perpetually clumsy condition (wrsened by AMS), I am happy to be alive. The
weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead and
dying, including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late for
the north side. By the time i am allowed to send this, the media will have
already begun reporting on this tragedy. I was slowed by my vomiting and had
i continued, i likely would have been trudging up with this group.

In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends: ensuring
his safety so suz and i could take a vacation. He is stuck on the ridge now,
dying, and will likely be dead by morning. One of our strongest guides is
with him and he, too, will probably die. This guy is super strong but the
altitude has snatched him. We're in shock here and can do nothing but stare
into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight. I have been
assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives. A
member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp 2 this morning, 3
Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge, and a spaniard is flirting
with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema, despite Chris
Warner's valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night. When i
think of this mountain now, i think only of death.

Russ is quite experienced in hig-altitude rescues but this is the first time
he has unleashed the team for our own. It is a totaly professional
logistical operation (locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up
into the jet stream), relying heavily on the sherps who are just incredibly
strong. Many stories of heroism over last 24 hours and many to come. The
guide and the client spent the night on the ridge (8650 meters), incoherent
and immobile, freezing, but they were saved when Asmus turned around from a
desperate stumble home, climbed the second step (brutal) for the second time
in 10 hours, and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark.
Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes, reaching
top camp (8300 meters...still incredibly dangerous) at 11:30 pm. It was a
relatively warm night (just below)and both client and guide were seen moving
space blankets this morning through the telescope. Alive. But they could not
stand. One could not see. No comms. Bivouacs above 8000 meters are epics and
you are sure to read about this.

Coordinating therescue from the Col, Russ then rousted all available bodies
and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days, Purba and
Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone, humping oxygen. The
American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up
their summit attempt (remember, they failed last week and also failed in '99
so this is a huge sacrifice) to make the rescue. It looked bleak this
morning but after some injections our teammates began to move, carried by
the strong Americans. As i type, they have been moving at a snail's pace and
the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselves.We hope our
sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be an
absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue. Remember, that ridge is 14
inches across for stretches, dropping 10,000 feet on either side. When i
gazed down 2 nights ago, it was truly like staring out of the window of a
plane, so steep was the drop. The sherps are going to have to be supermen.

From the ridge and high camp, chris and asmus (they've been wasting there
for over 36 hours now) have been gathering oxygen for the 2000 meter descent
to ABC. They are sucking some themselves to ensure we don't have a
double-rescue. I'm feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help
with the rescue, assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive. Too high
for a helo on this side so we'll have to platoon them down asap. Other
members who summitted earlier are still up too high, too slow descending
from 'safe' camps, and i may help them down as well. So i will not be back
by mem day--we have to get these people down.

The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope, sulking
and making occasional trips to the waste moraine. The client was slower and
slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field. I thought: uh oh.
Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold
and the guide was pursuaded by the client. Soon russ was on the radio
screaming at the guide to drag the client down, but the hour grew late and
suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap, both men immobile
and nearly incoherent, the guide kicking and draggin the client, to no
avail. Asmus was with them and performed valiantly, as i mentioned, but no
one was in a position to help. At that height, every second counts and the
other teams rushed past on their way to safety. When you rush into a burning
building you can't linger, especially if your physical performance is
literally cut in half.

I am praying for these two--and the russians--and  it's hard to think f
anything else as they progress home, mumbling, step by step. I have messages
from their wives but they are unable to [process spoken language at this
point. Even if they get down, i wonder what the results will be. It's really
sad. I am sure they are also severely dehydrated--i'll explain the process
when i get home but siffice to say you literally can't boil water fast
enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude. My heartbeat at top camp
was 180 when i was 'resting' in my sleeping bag before the attempt. My
tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids
coming at a rate of a liter an hour, doing nothing.

I feel lucky today. Very lucky. When i think of my own descent, alone,
throwing up along the way yesterday, i realize just how razor-thin this
whole thing is. There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my
jumar on a supposedly new rope, ony to reach the anchor point to find a
ten-year-old knot, totally fried by the uv rays. Other times i stepped in
snow footprints and slipped, sliding down on my stomach until the rope
jerked taut. Too many ways to die here.The aussie who gave me his water in
the bowl may have prevented another casualty. Who's to say? Problem here is
that, unlike the events we're used to when we sprint to the finish line (we
used to say in crew that the perfect race was when you passsed out at the
finish), you have to reserve a certain amount to get the hell down the
mountain. And it's so hard to do that. Is a quarter tank enough? Half? Or do
you need even more because, in truth, you are dying from the moment you
leave camp 3 (not even top camp).

I will pass this info only when the word is out--sorry--but will keep you
updated from there once i talk ro russ. It's hard watching friends die but
we're helpless down here.

It's attached, and I appreciate your feedback (particularly re: a doable filing time for your shop). Included is COB, even though I'm not sure there's enough liquidity to support it. Time will tell. Thanks for the comments on Mid-C; I'll carry on with that as a point, although I'll probably have to define it (perhaps list the buses?) to calm players' concerns.
 
This template is for participants, whom will be kept confidential at all times. I will use purchases and sales, but won't reveal which is which or the identity or positions of any participants. For this index to have any value, accurate numbers must be provided. I assure you, I will respect confidentiality--those who don't, don't deserve to stay in business.
 
I will send you confidentiality agreements and the index methodology for your records, if you like, but first, there will be a beta-testing period during which the methodology may be tweaked. (For example, players may decide they would like to see bal-day deals included within the indexes. We did not include them in the indexes I developed for the Eastern Interconnect, however.)
 

Powerdex has been set up for the purpose of doing these hourly indexes, and integrity is key here. It is my intention for it to be a useful, accurate, comprehensive and independent service. Please let me know what you require from me. It's always a pleasure talking with you.

Since these volumes are relatively minimal, do you want me to go ahead and put in an interdesk swap between LTNW and STNW to flat you out at the curve price for 11/15 as of 11/14?

Subject: Dinner Reply

Sean:

Thanks for the dinner the other night.  I enjoyed meeting with you and Deanna and getting caught up on how things are going.  It was also good to hear that both of you are optimistic about the outlook with UBS.  I wanted to respond to your offer to meet with Mr. Belden to discuss potential opportunities within your origination group.  Having considered the opportunities relative to the outlook for my consulting business, I am not interested in pursuing the UBS opportunity at this time.  The concept of running the origination from Seattle intrigued me initially, but I cannot personally advocate a geographically segregated origination operation as a viable business solution.  

I would be interested in a follow up meeting with you and Tim, but I think my intent would be framed from exploring potential opportunities to provide consulting services to UBS rather than exploring employment opportunities.  I understand that this may not fit with your needs to prioritize your own time and efforts right now, but if you would like to get together, please let me know.

Also - I don't have Deanna's e-mail address.  If you could forward this on to her, I would appreciate it.  Thanks again for the dinner last week.

"Cara PBA","On August 16, 2001, Enron counsel in DC requested that the Enron Northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year.  The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, Enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested.  Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.

The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive.  Utilizing Cara's comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task.  There were many instances where we hit a ""brick wall"".  Specifically, it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset, although it was imperative we do so.  Cara was instrumental in bridging this gap.

As a result of her efforts, we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC, and subsequently for our FERC filing.  I recommend that Cara receive a Personal Best Award for the amount of $2,000.

Good investigating.

Sean,

Can you  make sure that FTRs in 01 did not rise up from 00 to make sure the effect is due to CAISO raising a capacity benefit margin?  

Sue, Steve: FYI

Subject:	Re: TTC/ATC with the attachment!!   

This gets even better.  On Tuesday, April 3, I had our California prescheduler ask the ISO Day Ahead personnel why the COB S/N ATC had been decreased so much.  There reply was that the ATC is calculated by taking the TTC less Existing Transmission Contracts less FTRs less Capacity Benefit Margin.  Normally, and up until January 1 of this year, they haven't used a Capacity Benefit Margin when calculating ATC leaving the state.  So the amount of ATC they had at COB S/N is normally in the 700 to 800 MW range, rather than the 35 to 60 MW of ATC they are using now.

We asked what this Capacity Benefit Margin was, and they said it's not in their tariff, it's in the NERC Operating Manual.  I went to the NERC web site, and sure enough, Capacity Benefit Margin is a defined term.  It reads : ""Capacity Benefit Margin is the amount of TTC reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements"".

The ISO's use of this language is outrageous.  This is language to ensure that load has transmission access to remote generation.  I can see them using this argument with respect to COB N/S but no way COB S/N!!  In fact, one could very easily argue that they are VIOLATING this criteria.  If we have load in the Northwest, and have purchased generation in California, we should have access to available transmission.

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the ""DART flag"" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.

Stewart,

Per our discussion I have changed Modesto basis option deal #520328 to reflect the restructured terms:

* original peak deal (leg 1) deal end date was changed from 9/30/01 to 8/5/01. 
* new leg 3 was created for 8/6/01-9/30/01.  All terms stay the same except that strike price was changed to $3 and an extra premium was added for $2/MWh for the new leg.

I have also put a note in the comment field requesting the confirm group to send documents to you before sending to counterparty.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Subject:	BPA Termination of Contracts
Importance:	High
Sensitivity:	Confidential

Yesterday we received a letter from BPA under which BPA terminated two of its agreements.  Ed, Harlan and I discussed some aspects of this earlier today.

Some additional information that Steve Hall and I just discussed is summarized below.

The effect of this termination on our power scheduling is that the West Desk is now short by 202 MW over its earlier position.  

After termination the contract positions are:

 COB:  		150 MW on peak (purchase from BPA)
		200 MW off-peak (purchase from BPA)

 Mid-C:		(339) MW on peak (delivery to BPA)
		(238) MW off peak (delivery to BPA)

Terminated contract numbers:

	97 PB-10123  (Wauna/James River)
	98 PB-10277 (Firm Power Sale)

The termination fo the Wauna/James River contract presumably also terminates the ""book out"" agreement negotiated earlier this year, and increases our net short position to BPA.

"Day Ahead ""Financial"" Parking/Lending product","I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL legal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, but I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For example, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but that it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forward to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EOL, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical power, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead position.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would appreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we need to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and EOL mechanics.

We've been keeping this deal in because I've been concerned about congestions at COB.  I'm not concerned going into February, so this contract is out of the money for February (probably in March thru May however).  If there is some reason to keep it whole, we have the length at COB.

"California TTC/ATC","Attached is a spreadsheet summarizing hourly TTC and ATC data for COB S/N from Jan 1, 2000 to April 2001.  The data were obtained from the ISO.
After looking at the data, it is clear that, although the TTC values have not changed from '00 to '01, the ATC values have decreased dramatically.  I believe the reason for this is the ISO's attempt to prevent exports to the Northwest.

I propose that we send this spreadsheet to our ISO rep (via Sue Mara) and ask him to explain the reason for the reduction.

This looks like it will work.  Since there has been some confusion around this, I'll lay out what I think will happen with this language.

Assumption #1:

MC on EOL is 300 at 350.
COB is not displayed on EOL.

Product 1 is COB; Product 2 is MC

COB/MC Spread is 5 @ 10 on EOL

Situation #1
Customer lifts the COB/MC spread at $10.  Enron will then BUY the MC at $325 and SELL COB at $335.

Situation #2
Customer hits the COB/MC spread at $5.  Enron will then SELL the MC at $325 and BUY COB at $329.


This is how it should work.

I suggest we test things out now, and see how it works.

Thanks,

Sean

"Re: COB/Mid-C Spread","Kevin,

Here are the examples we talked about

Assumptions:

1.  EOL and Broker market:  COB $30 @ $40.
2.  We put out a COB/MC market $4 at $7.
3.  In EOL, Product 1 = COB and Product 2 = MC.

Here's what will happen in the broker market:

(A) If someone hits my bid of $4 in the broker market I will BUY COB at something like $35, and I will SELL Mid-C at $31.
(B) If someone lifts my offer of $7 in the broker market I will SELL COB at something like $35, and I will BUY Mid-C at $28.

If you take the same assumptions and show this market on EOL, here's my understanding of what will happen:

(C) If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL COB at $35, and I will BUY MC at $39 (compare this with (A))
(D) If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY COB at $35, and I will SELL MC at $42 (compare this with (B)).

Clearly this doesn't work.

One possible solution, I think, is to examine what happens if you put out a COB/MC product on EOL, but switch the products such that Product 1 = MC and Product 2 = COB, and assume we put the underlying Product 1 market out as MC $30 @ $40.

(E)  If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL MC at $35, and I will BUY COB at $39 (achieves same result as (A), which is what we want).
(F)  If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY MC at $35, and I will SELL COB at $42 (achieves the same result as (B), which is what we want).

I realize (E) and (F) don't jive with our long contract description, but conceptually it works.

If you have any questions, let me know.

"RE: Hi","
Hey there!

How's it going?  I understand you guys stole one of our marketers.  That's ok, I'll forgive you.  Things are insanely boring here.  Basically we are in a wait mode, probably, I think, until February.  This is the first time in 5 years I haven't had to worry about P&L and I have to say it's pretty weird.  It's nice sleeping in though.

So supposedly we have 14 potential suitors. You've probably heard of the banks, and I've also heard Reliant is putting together a bid.  THAT would be interesting.  We laid off probably half the people in our office--pretty much all back office support and some conservation/renewable people.  Bad timing.  Plus, when we laid off Enron Broadband folks, they got a six month severance package, and EBB didn't make any money, and in fact lost a substantial amount.  Then Enron lays off people on our floor, which has made a phenomenal amount of money, and gives them basically $4,000 taxed at 48%.  Life is not fair.

It's going to be interesting to see what this does to the industry.  I think the California debacle, then Enron (now Calpine), is going to create an interesting dynamic going forward.  Credit is going to become more and more an issue, especially towards the back of the curve.  It's interesting, I remember 5 years ago the prediction was, when it was all said and done, there would be 6 big energy suppliers in the country.  Looks like it's heading that way.

So are you going to Europe?  Sounds like fun.  If it looks like we're going to be on the sidelines for a while, I might go on vacation for a couple of weeks, maybe Hawaii.

Well, I'm going to go grab a cup of coffee.  I hope everything is well with you.

Take care,

Sean

In case I did not already say so, this is a great move for us, and hopefully
for you.  We need a big step-up in risk management in PBL and agency-wide.
You will help us get there.

"Re: March Loss Paybacks","Arvina,

Your numbers are close enough to mine to agree.  I put in an annuity to Modesto for $158,321.16 dated March 31.  The Enron deal number is 573111 (just in case there is any confusion).

If there are any problems, give me a call.

Thanks,

"RE: Request for clarificatiobn of FERC order","Here are my comments

1.  I wouldn't agree the caps have hurt liquidity.  In fact, in the Northwest at least, they have actually increased liquidity.  Any decrease in liquidity can be attributed primarily to a couple of things (1) uncertainty about the level of the cap and (2) when the day-ahead prices trade above the cap (removing marketers as sellers).

I would propose the following cap timelines.  First of all, I think it's important that FERC realize the ""spot"" market really is two separate markets, what we call the ""day-ahead"" cash markets, and ""day-of"" real-time markets.  The 24-hour designation doesn't dovetail with the current market timelines and is a source of confusion that can adversely affect liquidity and dispatch of power plants.  For example, day-ahead cash typically trades from 6:00 am to approximately 7:00 am for next day deliveries.  However, on Thursdays the WSCC OTC market trades for Friday and Saturday deliveries, and on Fridays, we trade for Sunday and Monday (all of this can be adjusted for various reasons, but this is the typical schedule).  If we held to the 24-hour spot cap literally, then Tuesday thru Friday the cap would apply to the day-ahead market, but would not apply to Saturday and Monday.  This obviously cannot be an intended consequence.  I recommend the cap timeline be consistent with the day-ahead WSCC OTC trading timelines.

In addition, there is some question with respect to what cap applies to the day-ahead market.  What if the forecast calls for much higher temperatures and it is assured that real-time markets will be trading above the 85% threshold?  Assume that stage I, II or even III is a certainty.  It seems prudent that a higher day-ahead price cap be established (still consistent with FERC's guidelines).  Why?  Because you would want units prescheduled to have high reserve margins going into real-time, rather than scrambling to dispatch units real-time.  It seems like it would be prudent for some independent board to set the day-ahead price cap equal to either the 85% or Stage I limit prior to trading time.  This board would have to have regional representatives in order to be truly effective.  Establishing the cap does not have to be cumbersome or time consuming, in fact, it should be fairly easy.

The cap governing real-time transactions is clear.  However, what isn't clear is what happens when the new Stage I cap is actually lower than the existing 85% of stage I cap.  For example, during the first couple of days in July the real-time cap was operating under the 85% of Stage 1 criteria, approximately $92.  The ISO hit a Stage I and Stage II and the price actually fell to the $70s.  This created uncertainty exactly when it shouldn't happen.  As a result supply was apparently affected in California and the Southwest for a few hours across the peak.  It seems odd that prices should fall real-time as reserve margins decrease.  One could argue this is a good reason why caps should be tied to daily gas prices, but assuming that isn't an option, I propose something like this:  The DAY BEFORE (around 2200) the CAISO, or preferably an independent body, would determine the real-time non-Stage cap as well as a Stage minimum.  While in a stage I, II, or III the hourly price would be the HIGHER of the non-stage price cap OR the recalculated Stage price.  If the Stage I price turned out lower, then the non-stage price would be used for that hour, but the recalculated Stage I cap (and corresponding 85% price) would apply for the NEXT operating day, and for day-ahead cash trading for the next trade day.  This provides information before the trading period (enhancing liquidity) and eliminates strange price movements during real-time.  It also fits the FERC price cap paradigm.

2.  Marketer prices.  I think there is a clear bias against marketers in the order.  But given the fact it seems deliberately slanted against marketers, there are clearly three areas where marketers should be allowed to recover costs that are easily demonstrable.  First would be losses at a tie into California.  If we sell at the cap and incurr losses, then we can't sell at the cap.  Second would be the 10% credit premium.  Credit issues apply whether you're a marketer or generator.  Third would be call options.  It seems if the market trades above the cap and above the strike in a call option, that a party should be able to exercise and sell.  I'm not sure what the difference between a peaking plant and a call option is.

All:

Please review the attached rough arguments on what the FERC must do to fix it's current WSCC wide price mitigation mechanism.

Enron's (or its trade associations') filing(s) will attack bigger issues such as whether there should be price controls at all and whether the CAISO needs to be audited.  However, assuming we are stuck with a cap, I want to provide FERC with comments that at least allows marketers to stay in business.  The comments in the attached document are designed to address these ""nuts and bolts"" issues.  Formal comments are due next week but I need input from commercial folks like you by WEDNESDAY of this week.

Thanks,

"RE:","Bruce,

The 600K is salary, and nonperformance related bonus payouts.  It is NOT guaranteed bonus over and above salary (I wish it was).  Basically, I am 95% certain I will make a minimum of 600K/year with either company, worst case I'm looking at 500K/year (excluding incentive).  Incentive would be in addition to.  My offer would have to be in that ballpark.  If I worked 1/3 the year, assuming a base salary in the 250 to 300 range, I would get 100 less.  Also, I'm not trying to be vague.  Essentially I'm working with 3 moving parts--non of which has become crystal clear yet.  At this point, let's look at this:  2-year contract with an out after 1-year.  $275 base salary.  $225 signing bonus.  $225 retention bonus after 1-year.  If I take it, I'm done for another year.  Participation in the 17% incentive package.  Relocation package.  That seems to be the ballpark we are in.

Thanks,

Sean

   Thanks for the update.  I will forward this information.  I assume that
   the
   low numbers are guaranteed that no matter what happens to you or the
   company
   you will receive the min amount.  Is that true?  As far as Cinergy
   having a
   payout record- it does.  The bonus plan pays out 17% of profits, I don't
   think there is any other company paying that kind of money.  They paid
   on it
   last year.  However, the P&L has to be there, but the money was
   distributed.
   Also they pay on NPV of the deals so accounting doesn't enter into
   performance.  I think that is unique as well.

   As far as Houston goes, I can show you parts of the city that are
   beautiful
   and the commute is easy with lots of great neighborshood at tremendous
   value.  I'm 15 minutes from every venue (sport, education, theatre,
   musuems)

   not be
   trapped to one employer.  I lived in a few places and visited numerous

   with

   Down to brass tacks, eh?  This is always the interesting part.  Quite
   frankly Bruce, it's a pretty good job market.  Basically I'm looking at
   two
   other prospects.  The first will require me to sign a 2-year contract,
   the
   second will not.  The base component with the first is going to be
   around
   $275/year.  The second is going to be around $250/year.   As far as
   incentive bonus goes, I'm looking at about a minimum of $450 for the
   first
   to about a max of $750.  At the second I'm looking at a min of about
   $350
   to about a max of $900.  So over a one year period, we're looking at
   about
   $725 to $1.025M for prospect 1, and $600 To $1.15M for prospect 2.

   In terms of location, both prospect 1 and 2 are in attractive locations
   for
   me.  Prospect 1 is in a VERY attractive location.  To be honest, I'm not
   a
   big buyer of Houston, so I have to factor that into the equation.
   Secondly, both prospects are big, well entrenched players, so I'm pretty
   confident of the above numbers.  While I'm pretty excited about the
   prospects of being on the ""ground floor"" with Cinergy, I also have to
   recognize Cinergy doesn't have a P&L track record for me to assess the
   probability of the incentive payout.  For that reason, I think, I would
   require a fairly large guaranteed number the first year, while still
   participating in Cinergy's incentive program.  The second year I would
   be
   willing to renegotiate the guaranteed number if we had our feet
   underneath
   us and it looked like we had the room to prove ourselves and generate
   some
   serious money for the company.

   Given what you guys have in mind, I honestly think I can help you
   achieve
   your goals more quickly, and with less risk.  I also think there is
   serious
   money to be made with the right team--I've seen it happen at Enron.

   No matter what happens, I appreciate you taking the time.  Please also
   extend my thanks to everyone I had the opportunity to meet in
   Cincinnati.

3.  There has to be less ambiguity with respect to day ahead cash markets.  For example, assume it's a Monday and the ISO is under normal conditions and the price is $92.  Then assume on HE 14 the ISO declares a stage one and the price clears at $100 and the price is $100 for the rest of the day.  Tuesday assume the price is $85 during the first few offpeak hours, but the Wednesday forecast shows identical conditions as Monday.  What is the day ahead cash cap trading Tuesday for Wednesday?
Is it $85 or $100?  One could make the argument that it should be $100 because it is reasonable to assume they will be in a stage one real time on Wednesday, but at the time cash is traded they are not in a stage one.

It seems to me the easiest way to solve this problem would be to have an independent market organization declare what the day ahead cash market price was before the cash market traded.  So for the example, they may recognize it's likely a stage 1 $100 cap will be in effect on Wednesday, so they'll set the cap at $100.  The market will know before hand and there will be no ambiguity.  More efficient market, less litigation.

4.  What about call options?  If a generator owns a call option at $125, the cap is $100, but the market is actually trading $150, does the generator have the right to exercise the option?  What if the generator has a plant that he can fire up at $150.  Does the generator have to wait until the price hits $150?  Seems like the strike price on an option would be an easily demonstrable expense.  And would there be a difference between a marketer owning an option and a generator owning an option?

"TTC/ATC with the attachment!!","Attached is a spreadsheet summarizing hourly TTC and ATC data for COB S/N from Jan 1, 2000 to April 2001.  The data were obtained from the ISO.
After looking at the data, it is clear that, although the TTC values have not changed from '00 to '01, the ATC values have decreased dramatically.  I believe the reason for this is the ISO's attempt to prevent exports to the Northwest.

I propose that we send this spreadsheet to our ISO rep (via Sue Mara) and ask him to explain the reason for the reduction.

Thanks

"Introductions","Steve,

I've been talking with James over the last couple of weeks about possible opportunities at Duke.  Just to give you a quick look at my background, I've been running Enron's short-term Northwest desk for about 4 years.  Prior to that, I performed more or less the same function with PGE for a couple of years.  My contract with Enron is up July 31.  I'm under a 3-month noncompete obligation after I leave Enron.  Theoretically, my last day with Enron could be May 31, so the first day I'd be able to start somewhere else would be Sept 1.

To be honest, at this point I'm shopping.  My goal is to have 3-4 options to consider by May 31.  I'll be in Salt Lake on May 4, so if you are interested in getting together to talk about any opportunities Duke might have, please let me know.

Thanks,

Sean

"Spread Update","We've been experimenting with spreads on EOL and I want to lay out to you what happens when you transact a spread on EOL.

Assume you want to put out the COB/MC spread -4 at 4.  Also assume COB is 275 at 300.  As you know, if you put this out in the broker market, you would expect to buy COB $4 under Mid-C or sell COB $4 over.

If you want to duplicate these trades on EOL you could put out COB/MC -4 at 4, but here is what's going to happen (assume COB mid is 287.5).  If somebody 'hits' your 'bid' you will sell COB at 287.5 and buy Mid-C at 283.5.  If somebody 'lifts' your 'offer' you will buy  COB at 287.5 and sell MC at 291.5.  Effectively the EOL transaction turns your bid into an offer and an offer into a bid, or the title is COB/MC but the transaction is MC/COB.  The problem it seems to me is that, fundamentally, bid is always first, offer is second.  For this to work as is, the market would have to accept that, in all cases bid/offer applies except with EOL spreads where it's offer/bid.

This seems too confusing to me.  I'm not sure how you guys feel about  it, but I want to give you a heads up.

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

 (Both versions of build route, Will Smith will know what I am talking about).

Sean:

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the ""DART flag"" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.

Don't know if you saw this:

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced August 21 that it
filed and simultaneously settled administrative proceedings against Avista
Energy, of Spokane, Washington, former Avista Energy Vice President of
Trading Thomas Johns of Spokane, Washington, and former Avista Energy trader
Michael T. Griswold of Seattle, Washington. In the Order issued today, the
CFTC finds that on four days between April 1998 and August 1998, Avista
Energy manipulated the settlement prices of the Palo Verde and
California-Oregon-Border electricity futures contracts traded on the New
York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), in order to increase the company's net
gain on certain over-the-counter option positions, whose value was based on
the settlement prices at issue. 
 
The CFTC imposed cease and desist orders against Avista Energy, Griswold,
and Johns, and required them to pay civil monetary penalties of $2.1
million, $110,000, and $50,000, respectively. The CFTC also imposed an
18-month trading ban on Griswold and a 12-month trading ban on Johns. The
settlements require Avista Energy, Griswold, and Johns to cooperate in any
further investigations and proceedings related to the conduct at issue.
Avista Energy, Griswold, and Johns consented to the entry of the orders
without admitting or denying the findings made in the orders. 
 
The CFTC also filed a ten-count complaint against former Avista Energy Vice
President of Trading Strategies William H. Taylor of Houston, Texas, former
Avista Energy trader Robert S. Kristufek of Chicago, Illinois, and NYMEX
floor broker Anthony J. DiPlacido of Bellmore, New York, charging them with
participating in the manipulative scheme.

"RE: P&L associated with Avista transaction to cover NW book of business (Feb1-9)","Steve,
 
The difference is because I rounded the purchase prices from AEP and Avista in the P&L spreadsheet, rather than taking a weighted average.  The wire request amount is correct.

Sean,  
 
I came up with a $3936 difference between this and your wire requests.  The wire requests were on the high side.  I am sending it off to Houston with a note that we may need to revise it.

Subject:	Re: TTC/ATC with the attachment!!   

Sean is absolutely right about the misuse of CBM.  Capacity Benefit Margin was put in the ATC standard at the beginning to allow a party to recognize the use of interconnections to reduce the amount of reserve a system must carry internally. The only capacity which California could restrict on that basis is inbound.  Has California decided to be the protector of the reserves of the NW with its puny installed capacity within the state?  It is clearly manipulation for them to claim CBM for outbound capacity.

Good investigating.

Sean,

Can you  make sure that FTRs in 01 did not rise up from 00 to make sure the effect is due to CAISO raising a capacity benefit margin?

Subject:	Re: TTC/ATC with the attachment!!   

This gets even better.  On Tuesday, April 3, I had our California prescheduler ask the ISO Day Ahead personnel why the COB S/N ATC had been decreased so much.  There reply was that the ATC is calculated by taking the TTC less Existing Transmission Contracts less FTRs less Capacity Benefit Margin.  Normally, and up until January 1 of this year, they haven't used a Capacity Benefit Margin when calculating ATC leaving the state.  So the amount of ATC they had at COB S/N is normally in the 700 to 800 MW range, rather than the 35 to 60 MW of ATC they are using now.

We asked what this Capacity Benefit Margin was, and they said it's not in their tariff, it's in the NERC Operating Manual.  I went to the NERC web site, and sure enough, Capacity Benefit Margin is a defined term.  It reads : ""Capacity Benefit Margin is the amount of TTC reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements"".

The ISO's use of this language is outrageous.  This is language to ensure that load has transmission access to remote generation.  I can see them using this argument with respect to COB N/S but no way COB S/N!!  In fact, one could very easily argue that they are VIOLATING this criteria.  If we have load in the Northwest, and have purchased generation in California, we should have access to available transmission.

On August 16, 2001, Enron counsel in DC requested that the Enron Northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year.  The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, Enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested.  Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.

The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive.  Utilizing Cara's comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task.  There were many instances where we hit a ""brick wall"".  Specifically, it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset, although it was imperative we do so.  Cara was instrumental in bridging this gap.

As a result of her efforts, we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC, and subsequently for our FERC filing.  I recommend that Cara receive a Personal Best Award for the amount of $2,000.

"Re: Power spread","Kevin

This looks like it will work.  Since there has been some confusion around this, I'll lay out what I think will happen with this language.

Assumption #1:

MC on EOL is 300 at 350.
COB is not displayed on EOL.

Product 1 is COB; Product 2 is MC

COB/MC Spread is 5 @ 10 on EOL

Situation #1
Customer lifts the COB/MC spread at $10.  Enron will then BUY the MC at $325 and SELL COB at $335.

Situation #2
Customer hits the COB/MC spread at $5.  Enron will then SELL the MC at $325 and BUY COB at $329.


This is how it should work.

I suggest we test things out now, and see how it works.

Thanks,

Sean

Sean, thank you for your rent deposit yesterday.  I really appreciate your timeliness.  I will be in Portland Sat Jan 26 to Wed Jan 30 for business reasons.  
 
I need to have an electrician install smoke detectors per the new code effective the first of January + I want to get the phone jack fixed in the guest bedroom.  I also need to meet with the landscaper about pruning the back hedge.  I'll be up to my ears in business meetings all day Monday and Tuesday morning.  I was thinking about making appointments for the electrician and the landscaper for Tuesday afternoon.  I will be there to let them know what I need to have done so I can give them access.  Is that ok with you?    Is there anything else that needs attention?
 
Hope life isn't too crazy for you with all the press Enron is getting these days.  Deborah

"Follow-UP","Steve,

Thanks for the dinner and chance to meet everyone Friday.  It actually was a pleasure to talk with Nancy (rare, I think for an interview situation).

I'm sorry to say I'm still in a holding pattern.  There are a couple of bits of information I still need to process, but I thought I would email you with some initial numbers.  I'd also like to confirm my understanding of Duke's compensation program.

Base Salary:  $150K-$175K/year

LTI:  100% of base salary paid out in options that vest 1/3 every year.

Performance Incentive:  2X to 6X base salary.

No contract.  Full relocation package.

This is what I recall from the interview.  If I'm wrong, I'd appreciate clarification.

Regardless of what happens, I appreciate your time and consideration.  I should be able to come to a decision next week.

Thanks,

Sean

Subject:	-$141,000 P&L hit on 8/13/01

Sean:

I have been looking at the -$141K P&L hit in ""Other Changes"" on 8/13/01 you were inquiring about.  The biggest ""contributor"" of this hit is the restructured Modesto deal # 520328.3, which alone caused -$130K in Other Changes (a.k.a. 2nd Order in financial terms).  I believe what happened is that Matt re-marked the daily volatility curves down by a significant magnitude on 8/13/01 (* please see curve managers for the change).  Usually when volatilities changed drastically they would disrupt financial evaluation models and more likely to cause a change in deal value by factors which cannot be explained (i.e. Second Order).  This doesn't necessarily mean that the evaluation is incorrect but just that there will be some value change for which the models cannot pinpoint the reasons.

Anyway, for this basis option deal you lost $94K on 8/13, and this -$94K can be broken down into Curve Shift (-$19K), Gamma ($1.5K), Vega (70K), Theta (-16K), and Second Order/Other Changes (-$130K).    I looked at the curve change and interest rate change between 8/10 and 8/13 and they are relatively insignificant, but the drastic volatility mark down makes me feel that your losing money in this deal is somewhat consistent w/ what we should expect.  

I am still working with IT to see if we can nail this down to give you a more specific explanation.  In the mean time, if you have any thoughts or concerns, please feel free to let me know.

Thanks,
Fran

Thanks for the response.  I think I would like to see Cinergy's bid.  I sort of have to weigh many nonfinancial issues as well.  It would be nice to know where we are at.  If you could provide me a rough number, that would be helpful.

Thanks,

We have not reached an answer on the head trader.  McCabe is on vacation
this week.  I would say we are not prepared to match any of your offers.
I'm not sure it makes sense to show you an offer that is lower than your
other deal.  If you still interested let me know.  Thanks for coming to see

Sean,

This is just to confirm our conversation over the phone on 12/04/01 at about
9:45 AM Pacific Time.
You stated that Enron will not be able to deliver the 10 MW HLH energy MID C
product to Grays Harbor PUD starting at HE 7 for 12/05/01.

Pursuant to Section 21.3 of the WSPP Agreement we will take steps to
mitigate damages for failure to deliver power.

Please reply with your written confirmation.

"RE: Day Ahead ""Financial"" Parking/Lending product","Kevin,

My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how the Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like real-time is a success, so let's get going with this.  

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on real-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a ""US Pwr Phy Firm  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART""  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the party selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each hour.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I would be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transaction.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow such that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions that needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following language to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal review).

""This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delivery on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-time means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consistent with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices.""

Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.

Sean,

The language is below.  Also, Savita wanted to conference call you this afternoon to discuss this product.  What time is good for you?

Kevin

A US Power Transaction with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. under which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall purchase a quantity of firm energy equal to the Hourly Quantity at the Contract Price. The Contract Price shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Web Site.  ""Firm energy"" is power that is or will be scheduled as firm energy consistent with the most recent rules adopted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council for which the only excuses for failure to deliver or receive are if an interruption is (i) due to an Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of the WSPP Agreement; or (ii) where applicable, to meet Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.  Notwithstanding any other provision in the underlying agreement between the Seller and the Buyer that governs this transaction (the ""Agreement""), if Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public utility or statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment of damages for failure to deliver firm energy as provided in the applicable cover remedy section(s) of the Agreement.  ""WSPP Agreement"" means the Western System Power Pool Agreement as amended from time to time.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery or receipt of power at Mid Columbia.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the ""Hourly Quantity').
The transaction is for on-peak (""Peak"") hours on each Delivery Day beginning with the hour ending 0700 (6:00 am) and concluding with the hour ending 2200 (10:00 pm) Pacific Prevailing Time.  ""Delivery Day"" means a day during the term of the transaction that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday, excluding any day that is a NERC holiday.

Subject:	Day Ahead ""Financial"" Parking/Lending product

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL legal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, but I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For example, let's say Morgan Stanley agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but that it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forward to real-time, Morgan Stanley has two options.  They can buy from us on EOL, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical power, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead position.

Kevin, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would appreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we need to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.

Subject:	Federal Legislative Update



Congressional Republicans Draft Energy Bill to Aid the West	
Rep. Joe Barton has spliced together emergency legislation aimed at aiding energy markets in the Western United States via funding for improvements in California's constrained transmission line SP-15 and directing federal disaster officials to prepare for power outages.  The move by Republicans came as Democratic criticism of the Bush administration's response to the California power crisis intensified Wednesday.  Although the bill will not contain the price caps sought by Democrats and a handful of Republicans, Barton said he would allow amendments in support of price controls during committee deliberations.  A list circulated by GOP staff in recent weeks includes a range of ideas such as relaxing environmental rules, subject to a governor's request; increasing federal energy assistance to low-income consumers; firing up mothballed power plants; and directing federal facilities to reduce energy use by 10%.  Additionally, the bill would grant governors the flexibility to allow power plants that have exceeded emissions limits to temporarily keep operating during emergencies.

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the ""DART flag"" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.

Dear Portland Friends,
 
I am sorry I did not have to opportunity to say good-bye in person, so I am sending this message instead.  I am hoping that this message reaches all of you.  
 
It has been my privilege to have been able to work with and represent you in the various western region forums that were of interest to Enron.  I want to wish all of you the best for the future and if any group of individuals can make a new Enron work again it would be you.  I have learned a lot in my brief tenure at Enron and it has been especially satisfying working with professionals like each of you.  Hopefully sometime in the future our paths will cross again.
 
Happy Holidays to you and your families.  Also, if someone could also pass along this message to Cara S. in scheduling it would be much appreciated. (I cannot remember how to spell her last name...sorry Cara!)
 
Kindest Regards,

"RE: Hi","Hi there,

Thanks for the note.  It is very weird for sure.  I never thought it would happen to Enron.  One of the reasons I didn't go to a smaller shop, even though I was offered more money, was because I didn't want to deal with crap like this.  Lo and behold.  Life is strange.  Anyway, at this point it looks like Dynegy is the suitor for the big E.  I think it will happen.  The question will become, where are we going to be located?  Fortunately, I only have about 8 months left in my contract, so I won't have to put up with too much crap for too long.  We'll see.

Italy is awesome.  Really really is.  I realize it more and more since I came back.  Tuscany is so cool.  If you go there, go to San Quirico, Montecino and Montepulciano.  Very cool little towns and good wine.  Florence is very cool as well.  I may go back there for a month or so this June if things aren't to wacky.  Have a good time there; I'm envious.

Sounds like you are doing better.  Also sounds like work is fun and challenging.  So do you think you are going to stay there for a while?  Do you miss the West?  I don't think I'll live east of the Rockies, but you never know.

Well, it looks like this year might be as interesting as last.  I keep thinking things will mellow out a little, but things keep getting more and more strange.

It was great to hear from you and take care of yourself!

Hi Seaner,
How are things going? I hope your okay over there on the west coast. I can
sympathize with what your going through, I've been involved with a company
that everyone's watching, questioning, rethinking credit and exposure, and
on top of that friends and family calling to see how you are and assuming
the worst.  No matter where you go you get faced with the same questions,
you have to tell the same story over and over.  I remember from your last
email you had just renegotiated a deal with them, I hope that's going to
turn out the way you want and your not stuck. If there's anything that I can
do please let me know. 

Did I tell you, after hearing about your amazing trip through Europe I've
decided to follow suit. I'm trying to plan a trip to Italy for a week or so
in the next couple of months. I recall you said that that was one of your
favorite places to visit. I get excited jut thinking about it, I watched
'the talented mr ripley' and 'malena'(sub titles) again over the weekend to
get a feel for the place(most recent movies with an italian theme).
Otherwise same old stuff over here, I'm starting to work on some pipeline
and storage deals which are very interesting, modeling the optionality
(especially for interruptible storage) of the products can be very tricky
but the intrinsic value is pretty substantial if you can come up with the
right strategy. Any ways I was thinking about you and thought I'd drop a
line.  Take care, and please let me know if you need anything.

"Sean Crandall","Audrey,

Here is a brief personal work history.  I've been in the utility industry pretty much since 1988.  I started trading for Portland General Electric in 1995.  I've been a trader for Enron for the last 4 years.  I run Enron's short-term Northwest book.  I have market-making responsibility for the cash, balance, and prompt months for the Mid-Columbia and COB specifically, although I am responsible for the entire Northwest.  I also trade Palo Verde, SP15, and NP15.

I have recently talked with a couple of other trading outfits out west and generally the structure looks something like this:

1.  150 K Base Salary
2.  250 to 300 K Signing Bonus
3.  Various bonus structures, generally with a minimum guaranteed equal to the base salary.

Quite frankly a move to the east coast is not very appealing.  The compensation package would have to be very attractive for me to seriously consider a move to that area.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Sean Crandall

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

"Chelan","Yesterday I talked with Chelan's trader and she informed me they regard the 7 MW we are delivering to them as a ""good"" contract.  So long as we are able to deliver, they will accept deliveries.  I'm not sure what this means in light of their termination status, but since the price is $34, I'm going to deliver until I hear otherwise.

Yes.  We tried to take the language from one of the NP or SP peak products.

Kevin,

Is the SP and NP language in the spread language the same language we use when we transact SP15 or NP15 on eol?

Sean,
 
Do the Feb. and March positions you sent this morning account for the termination of the two BPA contracts?  If not, can you send me a revised version when you get a chance?  I am not sure which BPA deals here are terminated and which ones are still good.  Thanks.

"RE:","Down to brass tacks, eh?  This is always the interesting part.  Quite frankly Bruce, it's a pretty good job market.  Basically I'm looking at two other prospects.  The first will require me to sign a 2-year contract, the second will not.  The base component with the first is going to be around $275/year.  The second is going to be around $250/year.   As far as incentive bonus goes, I'm looking at about a minimum of $450 for the first to about a max of $750.  At the second I'm looking at a min of about $350 to about a max of $900.  So over a one year period, we're looking at about $725 to $1.025M for prospect 1, and $600 To $1.15M for prospect 2.

In terms of location, both prospect 1 and 2 are in attractive locations for me.  Prospect 1 is in a VERY attractive location.  To be honest, I'm not a big buyer of Houston, so I have to factor that into the equation.  Secondly, both prospects are big, well entrenched players, so I'm pretty confident of the above numbers.  While I'm pretty excited about the prospects of being on the ""ground floor"" with Cinergy, I also have to recognize Cinergy doesn't have a P&L track record for me to assess the probability of the incentive payout.  For that reason, I think, I would require a fairly large guaranteed number the first year, while still participating in Cinergy's incentive program.  The second year I would be willing to renegotiate the guaranteed number if we had our feet underneath us and it looked like we had the room to prove ourselves and generate some serious money for the company.

Given what you guys have in mind, I honestly think I can help you achieve your goals more quickly, and with less risk.  I also think there is serious money to be made with the right team--I've seen it happen at Enron.

No matter what happens, I appreciate you taking the time.  Please also extend my thanks to everyone I had the opportunity to meet in Cincinnati.

Subject:	Morning Gas Call

A few weeks ago Lavorato requested that the west power desk sit in on his morning meeting with the different desk heads.  I suggested that one of the cash traders sit in on the meeting as you guys have the best handle on what is likely to happen in the short term markets and you guys are always here at 5:45.  Jeff Richter has been sitting in on these meetings for the last couple of weeks.  I don't care how you guys handle it.  I originally thought that rotating between you guys might make sense.  These calls should be made on a regular line that is not recorded.  Let me know how you want to work it out.  If you are going to rotate, I would like to put together a schedule that I could have for myself and forward to Lavorato.  Thanks.  Let me know your thoughts.

 	 	    Dear Chuck,  In the wake of Enron's downfall, the Senate Energy Committee is taking a second look at the Public Utility Holding Company Act.  On Wednesday, the Committee will hold a hearing on the PUHCA and our Washington bureau will bring us the latest.   With talk of possible criminal activities in Enron's trading division, many are wondering what liabilities UBS Warburg could face.  On Wednesday from the Houston bureau, we'll talk with former U.S. Attorney and Porter and Hedges Partner Dan Hedges about problems that could arise for UBS Warburg.   Haynes and Boone, LLP Attorney Larry Pascal talks about how Argentina's economic crisis is affecting the energy industry. We'll have details on the disarray in Argentina from the Houston bureau on Wednesday.    On the West Coast, ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Saber Partners CEO Joseph Fichera on Wednesday.  Fichera says there are some serious issues being overlooked in regard to the CPUC's rate agreement with the CDWR.  Fichera will share his concerns during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   Also on Wednesday, Kym says she'll have more on the California Senate Energy Committee's hearing on the Independent Systems Operators' Market Design Plan for 2002.  Members of the committee say they have serious doubts about the ISO's ability to enforce market rules going forward.   We'll also talk with Hydrogenics President and CEO Pierre Rivard on Wednesday.  Rivard will join us from the NASDAQ during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast to discuss hydrogen fuel cell technology.    Closing Prices for Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2002    Crude: $20.07/bbl unchanged   Unleaded: $0.5852/gallon -$0.0079   Heating Oil: $0.5369/gallon -$0.0012   Gas: $2.074/mmBtu -$0.043   Fwd uE(Mar.): $3.55/mmBtu -$0.02   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.
