Also, assuming we accept, then what?  Are we an owner in ICE?

Subject:	Recommended Offer by ICE for IPE Holdings

This is to point out to you the approaching deadline for accepting ICE's Offer for IPE Holdings.  If we wish to accept this Offer, we must do so no later than 3 pm on Tuesday 29 May.

In the meantime, Michael has received calls from Richard Ward (IPE's CEO) inquiring as to our position, and it would be my view that we should accept the Offer. (Note that if ICE receives acceptances of 90% or more, then our shares in IPE Holdings will in any event be mandatorily acquired.  And assuming that such level of acceptances will be received, there is no reason for not accepting the Offer).

Please would you let me know whether you wish to accept the Offer.  Ideally, if we are to do so, I would plan to send the acceptance by close of business on Friday 25 May.


Thanks
Justin

"RE: Latest Offline Contact Status","Raj and I will talk tomorrow.  I will tell him we are a no at this time for what they offered. For all the contracting and work it would take to set up a NewCo at that valuation for $5 million working capital, no.  I think we would consider them for a channel and I respect their skills, but to work on a NewCo for that valuation, etc. is not a good use of our time right now.

I understand Reuters is moved to all hands on deck Thursday the 31st.  Webb, Zipper, Shelby, Piper for that meeting.  Does this now conflict with Sungard?

Let me know if and when you hear from C1 or i2.

What is the purpose of Philippe's dinner with McNealy?  Who all will be there?  Did they set it up?  Does Philippe know the purpose? 

How long does it take for BEA to get in the loop?  Do you and Kevin really think they are a player for this?

"Vanderbilt -  Fantastic Friday results","Vanderbilt Team -
We had a very successful and fun Fantastic Friday this weekend with our Vanderbilt candidates.  We invited 10 of them here for final round interviews.  All of them accepted the invitation and came this weekend.  Out of 10, 6 will receive offers and 4 will receive declines.  The offer letters will go out today for overnight delivery.  Candidates have until 1-14-02 to reply to the offer.

Recruiting is not over yet!  Now its cultivation time!!  I am going to assign cultivation teams consisting of one senior person and two analysts to be in contact with candidates weekly.  The analysts on the team are responsible for sending me a weekly email updating me on the candidate's status, including any issues that may have come up.  If you do not have an assignment but want to help with this effort, please go ahead.  The more contact these candidates have with us the better!  Of course, if you have any questions that you cannot answer, please contact me.

Thank you all for your help to this point, now its time to close the deal!!

"RE: Offline Update","Greg --

No word from C1 yet, which is strange.  I will give Mark Hoffman a call this week if I do not hear from Matt Graves soon.

I talked with Bill Popp of Sungard yesterday.  Bill is trying to gather up the appropriate Sungard folks for a meeting.  The bad news is that Sungard's going-in posture is for a royalities-only approach, much like everyone else has tried initially.  Obviously, this is preliminary, and we will have the opportunity to influence this.  Sungard is much more comfortable with their core business of processing transactions rather than that of selling front-end applications.  This bias makes them cautious in approaching the Offline opportunity.  Clearly, we need to get them in for a detailed demo -- their knowledge of Offline is still very sketchy. 

We are dealing with the trading and risk systems group in Sungard.  We also have a corporate-level sponsor in Ron Lang.  I will ask Mark Palmer if he can get us more info on overall corporate structure.  Thanks.

Let me know when you hear from C1.  Do you have any idea what they will respond with?

When is Sungard coming in?  Who is coming?  Do we have any organization chart or idea of how Sungard is structured, etc?  What part of Sungard are we talking to?  Let's find out some corporate info on them.

Let me know if Brady is a go for any of this.

On TibCo, I would not call them.  If they call you, I think the message that any of us should give them is that we are considering their offer, but that it falls well short of our valuation and we need to consider if we want to structure and close a deal (which will be difficult and time consuming) at the price level and investment level they committed vs. keeping 100% of the IPR and setting up some channeling partnerships vs. working with a different partner at a higher valuation/commitment level.

Hello --

A meeting with SAP takes place today, 5/21.

A meeting with John Fowler of Sun is scheduled for 6/12 in Houston.  This is the detailed demo and technical discussion.

I expect to hear from Commerce One early this week on the results of their Board meeting last Friday as well as a response to our last proposal.

Sungard will be giving us their follow-up response early this week to last week's conference call -- our expectation is a request for a demo meeting.

Greg Brady of i2 has said that he will be calling me this week.

Murray Rode of TIBCO has asked to talk with me after I debrief Greg on the Raj discussion last week.

Andy is following up with Reuters on the valuation question and the scheduling of more detailed meeting.

Steve,

I understand that you are rolling this product out for internal users only. In that case I have a couple of thoughts

1). I have no problem with an internal launch of this. If external, I have a very big problem.

2). I think it would be better for the relationship between ETS and ENW had you informed us of your intention to do this. You are using the EnronOnline brand and whether that is internal or external it is ours to manage. as this was a complete surprise to us. It doesn't really seem like just a pipeline risk management product.

3). Because this was not part of our development and operations effort, we cannot support the product technically. There will be no change management. Given the amount of changes we do to our back end there is a high likelihood that in the future your product will cease to function

4). It looks pretty good and I commend your ingenuity. 

If you disagree with any of this please feel free to let me know.

working as a Strategic e-commerce development & integration partner. We plan

<!-- This mail was sent to ""Andrew Zipper"" <andy.zipper@enron.com>, who belongs to
list enl-members-html -->
<!-- CONTENT START -->
 <p>The Washington bureau will have a full plate when we return from
Thanksgiving break.  <b>Congress returns</b> with many lawmakers urging
action on energy legislation before the end of the year.  Washington
Bureau Chief Peter Cook says there's a <b>long list of legislation ahead
of energy</b> in the Democrat-controlled Senate, but <b>Republicans are
threatening to force a vote through a filibuster</b>.  In turn,
<b>Democrats are saying they'll filibuster</b> any energy bill
containing a provision to open <b>Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge to drilling</b>.  The legislation battle continues next week.

<p>Peter also says the Washington bureau will continue to follow the
<b>FERC's major decisions</b> regarding how it assesses <b>market
power</b>.  The Commission announced a major change this week that will
impact many of the <b>large and small utilities across the country</b>.


<p>Also next week, we'll see what <b><I>Energy Daily</I> Publisher
Llewellyn King</b> has to say about <b>Pat Wood's performance</b> as
Chairman of the FERC.  And rumors are flying about <b>DOE Secretary
Spencer Abraham -</b> on Monday, King talks about the whispers he's
hearing in Washington.

<p>ENL's Gale Smith will have a report from the Houston bureau next week
on a <b>Louisiana company</b> that uses <b>rice hulls to create
power</b>.  <b>Agrilectric Incorporated</b> consumes some of this power,
but most of the electricity is sold to an area utility company.  We'll
have details next week.

<p>Also, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us coverage
from the <b>Alaska Resources Conference</b> taking place next Thursday
and Friday.  We'll also bring you details on the <b>final report
regarding</b> the chosen route of the <b>Arctic natural gas
pipeline</b>.  The report is due to Alaska's Governor on November 30.

<p>We'll hear from Center for <b>Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Technologies Executive Director John White</b> next week.  ENL's Kym
McNicholas will speak with White about his organization's <b>opposition
to the state's long-term power contracts</b>.  Catch White from the West
Coast bureau next week.

<p>Closing Prices for Nov. 21, 2001:

<p>Crude: $18.96    	
<br>Unleaded: $0.5273	
<br>Heating Oil: $0.5342	
<br>Natural Gas: $2.813	

<p>Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.
Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue
to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.
<b>Have a great Thanksgiving break!  We'll see you on Monday.</b>

<p><b>Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.</b>

"Re: HoustonStreet","Frank,

Thank you for the congratulations but unfortunately, I really am on maternity leave and therefore not at all up to speed on what is going on back at work.  However, Andy is available and also Philippe Bibi who is the CEO of Net Works and Greg Piper (COO) are in the office.  I am sure one of them can deal adequately with whatever issues have arisen.

I will be returning at the end of June and look forward to speaking to you then.

Louise,

Congrats on the new baby!  Babies are truly a miracle.  Best of luck with
it.  I hope you saw all the movies that you wanted prior to delivery,
because it will be years before you see the inside of a movie theatre.

I know you are on maternity leave, but if you happen to get this email,
please give me a call.  Unfortunately, we are headed down a path right now
that could get very messy between HoustonStreet and Enron.  I want to avoid
that if at all possible.  There has been a level of frustration in the
communication and cooperation between our teams.  If we could both sides to
cooperate and focus for a couple of days, I am confident we can iron out any
issues and be prepared to go live within a week.

We have a number of big players that are eagerly awaiting the launch of our
link because they want to trade with Enron in a neutral, third party
environment.  I also know for a fact that there are back office integration
opportunities that we can pursue together that would be difficult for Enron
to pursue alone.

Congratulations again on your new child.

Best regards,
Frank

Subject:	Follow up


Greg,
 
Thanks again for  our discussion of last week.  As we discussed, TIBCO remains  very interested in collaborating with Enron on the commercialization of the  Enron Online software.  We agree that a significant part of the challenge  with commercializing a software asset like Enron Online is to get it ""out  of the starting blocks;"" that is, to get the first few customer sales that  set a full-scale market opportunity in motion.  
 
We  would like to work with Enron to overcome the ""starting blocks""  challenge by acting as the sales and marketing agent for the software.   Enron would retain all IP, but grant the right to resell the software to  TIBCO.  As a reseller, TIBCO would share in the revenue from the sale of  the software.  For reselling, we would typically receive up to 45% of the  sale, depending upon the precise nature of TIBCO's responsibilites for the  marketing and selling activities.  Similar to our discussions to date,  Enron involvement in the sales process would remain critical.  The  involvement of an SI like Accenture would also continue to be important, but  TIBCO would act as the primary sales agent and apply its marketing capabilities  and sales force to selling the Enron software.  Again, we would be passing  the Enron software through our sales channels without owning any of the  IP.  Based on 6 months to 1 year of activity we could then revisit whether  or not Enron is interested in selling the IP to TIBCO.
 
In  addition, though, we also believe there is a bigger opportunity for TIBCO and  Enron to collaborate that would yield greater benefitsfor both parties.  That is, Enron could take an equity stake in TIBCO as  part of a larger agreement for TIBCO to generally act as the partner for  commercialization of Enron software assets.  We assume  that Enron has multiple software assets it would consider commercializing and a  broader agreement with TIBCO would enable Enron to establish a process for  software commercialization that could be repeated for multiple assets.  The  nature of the agreement between Enron and TIBCO would be broader than just  resale, in that TIBCO would assume the responsibility for all aspects of turning  the asset into a packaged software product and developing the related marketing  programs, in addition to selling the products.  Enron would still retain  the IP to the software assets, however.  Also, as a TIBCO investor, Enron  would see value not only in the revenue from software sold but also in the  appreciation of TIBCO stock, and all this value would accrue without Enron  giving up any IP.  
 
Obviously, this approach yields value over time from a software asset  rather than up front, but it offers five key benefits.  First, it  provides a repeatable process for commercialization of Enron software  assets--not just Enron Online; second, it overcomes the ""starting  blocks"" problem while allowing Enron to retain its IP and still take  advantage of TIBCO's software commercialization processes and expertise; third,  it allows Enron to receive revenue from both software sales and TIBCO stock  appreciation; and, fifth, it creates a larger software commercialization  framework that should have value in and of itself.
 
We  hope that we can find a way to work with Enron on its software commercialization  efforts, and we'd like to continue to explore the ideas here, in addition to any  variations you may see as alternatives.
 
Thanks,
 
 
Murray

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Andrew,  On Thursday, ENL's Stephanie Stanton is traveling to Florida to cover the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Gulfstream Natural Gas Pipeline.  The 744-mile pipeline is a joint venture between Duke Energy and Williams Energy, the parent company of ENL.  Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Alabama Governor Don Siegelman are scheduled to attend the ceremony, and we're crossing our fingers for a chance to speak with the governors about several issues.  Log on Thursday for coverage from Florida.   Tuesday, California Gov. Gray Davis threatened to bring a lawsuit against the FERC.  ENL's Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford says the bureau will follow the developments surrounding Gov. Davis and the FERC on Thursday.  Jay also reports, an important deadline for the FERC Market Monitoring and Mitigation Order is coming up on Friday.  The Cal ISO has until the close of business Friday, June 1 to submit an RTO proposal to the FERC.  The Washington bureau is scheduled to discuss all the action surrounding the FERC on Thursday.        ENL has a lot going on from the Houston bureau tomorrow as well.  Correspondent Kim Benestante says there is a report out saying power deregulation in Pennsylvania has failed.  The Houston bureau will bring us details and compare and contrast deregulation in Pennsylvania with Texas.  Kim also reports, Texas' Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railways will complete the industry's first coal-transportation option auction.  We'll have these stories and more from the Houston bureau on Thursday.    Also from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Centric Energy Group Principal Tom Gilhooley is scheduled to join us.  He's dropping by the bureau to discuss NYMEX crude and gasoline prices.  Be sure to catch the Gilhooley interview in the noon ET newscast.   From New York on Thursday, New York Independent System Operator Steve Sullivan is scheduled to join us.  He's stopping by to discuss the 11:00 a.m. ET news conference on the summer energy outlook for New York.  Sullivan will be with us in the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.

Subject:	Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - June 20, 2001

Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate in an Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to those who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past few years.  These informal, interactive forums will be approximately 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.  

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although attendance is not mandatory, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do ""reality checks"", create a ""rallying point"" and ensure Enron's executive management is on the ""same page"" about where Enron is going---and why.

We realize that individuals based outside the United States will not want to make a special trip to attend the meeting, but may be able to attend one of the sessions while they are in Houston on other business.  We also hope to schedule a similar session in London later this year.

We currently have a session planned for:

Wednesday, June 20, 2001 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Houston, EB50M

The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work:
?	Each session will have approximately 25 participants.
?	The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
?	This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations.
?	This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions.
?	You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum.
?	Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the
direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same.  We also ask that you refrain from canceling your attendance once enrolled so that we will not have to cancel the forum.  The Office of the Chairman is very willing to take valuable time from their busy schedules to hold these forums.  Enrollments will be on a first come first served basis and we hope you would be able to honor your commitment to attend.  For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Monday, June 11, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586.

We will confirm your registration with you, in writing and forward a list of enrollees to the Office of the Chairman.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson via e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806.  

Thank you.

Hi Julie

Thanks for the feedback.  Useful to know what the Journalists are using EnronOnline for.

Will go ahead and extend Reuters' guest access for a further 2 months.

Subject:	EnronOnline Guest Access - media feedback

Following on from the Dow Jones request, I have now had a request from Reuters to extend their guest access.  Please could you let me know if this is possible?

In the meantime, to give an indication of the value of the media guest access programme, I have spoken to both Reuters and Dow Jones to get a feel for how they are using the prices.

According to Dow Jones, the reporters access EnronOnline regularly during the day to check where the prices are and if they see, for example, any sharp movements, they will follow up with a call to a trader.  They are conscious that traders like them to be aware of what is happening in the market when they call, so they feel that this is proving to be an 'invaluable' tool.  In terms of using Enron's prices in their articles, the reporters do use EnronOnline's prices when preparing their market commentary as they have been told by brokers that Enron's prices are pretty reliable (aware that EnronOnline is not an exchange, they will normally confirm the prices with other parties).

The Reuters reporters look at the prices on an almost daily basis and use some of the prices in reporting.  In their view, it helps them not to keep calling the traders constantly, as well as helping them to keep track of the market.  They say that they are 'addicted' to the guest access.

Since he knows Accenture is one of our consulting companies, he contacted them to ask them the same question.

Mike and I think we should just request Accenture to not talk to this reporter since they are under a confidentiality agreement with Enron.

Greg/Andy/Kal -- 

Not clear to me if this is strictly Accenture's work for Credit or for EOL.  Not sure if they've worked for us, but I presume we don't want them taking ANY credit for our success given our origination goals and messages!

We know Vijay quite well and he is not easiest to deal with.  He has believed for years that Shell was going to take us over and never cured from that obsession.  I don't know anything about Vijay's visit, so don't know who he's speaking to in the US.  If he needs to be briefed on Enron Credit, I think that should be done by John here from London. 

And the decision to let Accenture talk about their work with Enron is one that has to be taken from corporate hq (Meredith). I would imagine though that our own Enron story is enough of a story, we don't need to do or like any 3rd-party endorsement from Accenture.

Accenture has done some work for us defining the 21st century credit process to support the online business environment.....not sure if they would add value here but we certainly would like Enron Credit discussed in the article if possible....

thanks

Hello Bryan.  Please see the note below and let us know if there is any way
we can use this to the benefit of Enron Online.  If not, we'll simply not

Greetings,

I will try to clarify what I know re: the ECONOMIST's interest in Enron,
and possibly speaking with someone at Accenture:

- Vijay Vaitheeswaran, reporter for the ECONOMIST, will be visiting Houston
next Monday-Wednesday; he leaves London this weekend for the States.

- he is doing 'an indepth' story on Enron, particularly interested in their
eBusiness operations;  he has been told that Accenture has worked on
different programs at/for Enron in general (NO MENTION OF SPECIFIC
PROJECTS!!!), that we are trying to ID what might be appropriate for the
reporter's needs .... and that we need more specific details from Vijay, to
nail down the right partner.

- Vijay has said only that he'd like to talk to someone who has worked on
Accenture's eBusiness work for Enron, to find out how Accenture has helped
Enron to maximize those ebusiness capabilities.

- would also like to discuss Accenture work around eBusiness in general

NOW, given sensitivities of the nondisclosure agreements around some of the
projects Accenture is currently working on w/Enron:

     1.  IS there anything that Accenture can tell this reporter about
eBusiness, without endangering the Enron relationship?  What would the
topics be?

     2. IF WE decide to participate, who would be the best Accenture
partner to be interviewed?  Peggy?  Kenny?  Jeff S.?

     3.  DOES ENRON approve of our speaking with the ECONOMIST?  (certainly
if they are talking with him, this could be an opportunity for us to
support, echo and otherwise fortify Enron's message points in this area - -
I look to Kenny and Peggy for guidance here).

Messages have been left with Vijay, asking for more specific information.
I will follow up with him as directly as I can on Monday;  since Vijay with
be in the US, he should now deal with me and/or Neil Nowlin, my media
relations colleague based in the Dallas office of BursonMarsteller
(Accenture's PR counsel).

I've attached some background info on Vijay (see below);

I look forward to your thoughts and comments.

Cheers
Darienne

BACKGROUND BIO INFO ON Vijay Vaitheeswaran:

Vijay Vaitheeswaran
The Economist

Vijay Vaitheeswaran covers oil for The Economist magazine in London.  He
earned a B.S. in mechanical engineering from M.I.T. and recently was
honored with The British Energy Award for the Best Public Utility
Submission at the 2001 Business Journalist of the Year Awards.
(The awards are supported by the Corporation of London, the Confederation
of British Industry, the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the
Chartered Institute of Bankers, sponsored by
industry, and judged by prominent journalists, and representatives of
non-profit institutions.)
Eight years ago, the former New Yorker went to work at a new job in London.
He is now as much a fixture at The Economist as the clunky old Atex system.
Vijay is a former mechanical engineer turned brand manager at Procter &
Gamble turned reporter. In 1994, The Economist sent him out to Mexico to
open its first bureau in Latin America. He returned in 1998 with a tan, a
stash of tequila and fine cigars, and a very bad attitude about frigid
England.
He's gotten over it, and just recently took on the global environment
energy beat, with responsibility for topics ranging from the obvious to
agriculture, mining and commodities, as well as the impact of all of these
things on economic development.

Here's a link to his most recent article in The Economist
A brighter future?
The Economist, Feb 8th 2001
By Vijay Vaitheeswaran

http://economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=497405&CFID=2201824&CFTOKEN=35970405
For the better part of a century, governments the world over have been
running the power business as a command-and-control monopoly. Even in
free-market America, most people have been getting their power from stodgy
local utilities unencumbered by competition. This method has its merits:
most of the rich world is now wired up. But it conspicuously failed in the
developing countries, where over 2 billion people still have no access to
electricity. And now, as concerns about the reliability and
cleanliness of grid power grow, its limitations are becoming more apparent
in the industrial world, too.

"RE: Origination focus","Andy,

Carl and Leonardo were not included on this email. I think it is important to keep them involved with the marketing teams (as they were before). In particular, they provide valuable knowledge about how EnronOnline actually works to people who may not be so familiar with these details.

To address this, could you re-send the email with Carl and Leonardo assigned to specific teams? An alternative would be to send an amendment identifying that they will work with all the teams, but I'm keen to ensure they don't feel like some kind of 2nd-class support. They have been instrumental in preparing presentations, materials, company lists, research and contract precedents and they would very much like to continue to play an important role in the marketing and execution and not just to be seen as some kind of administrative support.

Thoughts?

Dave

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"RE: Value Proposition for Enron from TechSpan","
Dear Andy

Thanks for your mail and we would be in touch with Mr. Jay Webb to further
our partnership. We have identified specific areas where TechSpan could
bring immediete value to Enron (Both from a technical and cost perspective)
and we look forward to discussing this with Jay.

Also, our Managing Partner (Mr.Puneet Pushkarna) is keen in discussing our
view on the partnership and the Strategic Nature of a long term association
with Enron(as has been discussed in our Board meetings with Goldman Sachs).
I would arrange this meeting with yourself, Mr. Jay  and our Sr.Management,
subsequent to our discussions with Mr. Jay Web.


Dear Jay

Good to know you. In fact, some of our B2B architects have heard about you
in terms managing the entire technical process for developing EnronOnline
and look forward to meeting you. I would fix up a time for our VP - Software
Delivery to discuss synergies and value proposition.


Andy, Jay, i sincerely hope that you have been able to get good insight into
our competencies from the e-commerce perspective and that Enron shares a
similar view on this potential association. Also, i am sure that there would
be multiple firms who are keen in associating with an esteemed company such
as Enron but the main differentiating factor would be in the companies who
are creative, Innovative and who could add significant value for your
current and future challenges. TechSpan strives to incorporate such an
approach with our clients and also the factor for our funding from Goldman
Sachs.

Thanks and looking forward to developing a long term mutually beneficial
relationship with Enron.

Regds, Arvind

The Scoop	
  <http://www.money.net/40images/clear.gif>
	
The major averages closed lower following several economic reports released early Friday.  The first report was the January Employment Report.  Nonfarm payrolls came in a bit weaker than expected, falling 89K versus the consensus expectation for a 50K decline.  Yet the big surprise in this report was the drop in the unemployment rate to 5.6% from 5.8% -- the consensus expectation was for a reading of 5.9%.  Getting into the details of the report, January saw an 89K decline in manufacturing payrolls which matched the overall decline.  At the same time, service-producing payrolls rose 56K as seasonal effects helped to lift retail payrolls 62K while health services added...

"RE: ICE - Mar27 Power & Gas VOLUMES","According to Dynegy Direct, the last transaction that John had executed was on 03/26/01, but no transactions for 03/27/01. Apologies, It looks like there was a refresh issue for the Dynegy Direct -ENA data. It should only be 14 deals for 03/27/01. Prior data was for the Month of March.

Thanks on that. It seems like there is an error in the DD-ENA tab. No John Arnold in it and Kelli Stevens goes on for 450 rows. Other than that it looks good.

Sheri talked to Mike Williams at TradeSpark and they do not provide transactional or volumetric data to the public, and currently there is no activity for Enron on that platform.

"Confirmation for meeting on Friday at 1.00pm","

Hi Andy,

I just wanted to do a note to confirm that Jim Perrello will be visiting you at
1.00pm this Friday.  I have attached a recent press release we issued announcing
Jim's appointment as CEO of Reuters Liquid Markets.  As discussed, the goal of
Friday's meeting is for Jim to provide feedback on the applicability of the
EnronOnline technology to the financial markets and particularly if, with little
customization, it could be used in the commercial paper marketplace.

I have copied Jim and would appreciate if you could email the details of where
he should go on Friday.

Cheers,
Simon

Justin,
The traders are free to use any platform they like. I do not approve or disapprove; they are in the best position to make that decision. It is EWS policy however that someone from Amita/Lara's group be the master user to montor activity and control what access agreements we accept.

"Recommended Offer by ICE for IPE Holdings","This is to point out to you the approaching deadline for accepting ICE's Offer for IPE Holdings.  If we wish to accept this Offer, we must do so no later than 3 pm on Tuesday 29 May.

In the meantime, Michael has received calls from Richard Ward (IPE's CEO) inquiring as to our position, and it would be my view that we should accept the Offer. (Note that if ICE receives acceptances of 90% or more, then our shares in IPE Holdings will in any event be mandatorily acquired.  And assuming that such level of acceptances will be received, there is no reason for not accepting the Offer).

Please would you let me know whether you wish to accept the Offer.  Ideally, if we are to do so, I would plan to send the acceptance by close of business on Friday 25 May.

Their position was anytime we take the system down for any reason, planned or un-planned, we should kill all orders to prevent someone from being unable to cancel an order while the system was down and then having it fill before he can get to it.

We actually have a plan in place to make this much better.  Effectively, we will have dual sites.  The second site will be used both for disaster recovery, as well as a convenient way to manage code releases without an outage.  Unfortunately, purchasing the hardware for this has been put on hold given the present circumstances.

Jay,

Have received comments that when multi day limit orders are placed, they are not alive after a friday night. I think this might have to do with orders getting wiped out duirng maintenance but I wanted to alert you to this.

"RE: EnronOnline Real-Time Quotes Service on Reuters","Thanks Andy - just wanted to know.  I also like the concept.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Zipper, Andy  
Sent:	04 June 2001 17:39
To:	Sherriff, John
Subject:	RE: EnronOnline Real-Time Quotes Service on Reuters

John,

We are sending our bid and offer prices to Reuters for most US Gas & Power products, as well as European Gas and Power, Crude and Refined products, Bandwidth, Coal, Emissions, Weather and Sea Freight.

We will receive 75% of all revenue Reuters collects from subscriptions to EnronOnline quotes. It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice. We are under no obligations to provide levels of service.

Revenue expectations:

Reuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop. They have 5,000 Energy desktops worldwide.

thus with 100% penetration we would get 5,000 x 150 x 12 x .75= $6,750,000;

With a more realistic assumption of 50% penetration the yield to Enron would be $3,375,000 p.a.

This revenue does not include the incremental benefits, in our view, of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace. In the future I could see us adding a transactable API to the product through Reuters, which would enhance the ease of transaction by Reuters users.

If you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line.

"Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - June 20, 2001","Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate in an Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to those who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past few years.  These informal, interactive forums will be approximately 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.  

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although attendance is not mandatory, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do ""reality checks"", create a ""rallying point"" and ensure Enron's executive management is on the ""same page"" about where Enron is going---and why.

We realize that individuals based outside the United States will not want to make a special trip to attend the meeting, but may be able to attend one of the sessions while they are in Houston on other business.  We also hope to schedule a similar session in London later this year.

We currently have a session planned for:

Wednesday, June 20, 2001 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Houston, EB50M

The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work:
?	Each session will have approximately 25 participants.
?	The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
?	This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations.
?	This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions.
?	You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum.
?	Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the
direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same.  We also ask that you refrain from canceling your attendance once enrolled so that we will not have to cancel the forum.  The Office of the Chairman is very willing to take valuable time from their busy schedules to hold these forums.  Enrollments will be on a first come first served basis and we hope you would be able to honor your commitment to attend.  For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Monday, June 11, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586.

We will confirm your registration with you, in writing and forward a list of enrollees to the Office of the Chairman.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson via e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806.  

Thank you.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Find Out how to Join The Downtown Club May 29 & 30!

"EOL Email","Andy,
I know EOL email is far down on the priority list but I wanted to forward the responses to you.  Just about everyone we spoke with gave a positive response.  It looks like our biggest hurdle is getting them to actually complete the information and not just ignore it.  If we ever went forward with this, I would suggest that we use pop up boxes first and then forward a list of the remaining names that we need to the Master User to fill out.

-Dan


Here is a list of the companies and their responses about receiving email updates from EOL:

Company					Response
Kansas City Power & Light			No problem asking for the information as long as it is strictly for our use
Central Hudson Gas & Electric Co.		""
Cline Resources & Development Co.		""
Duke						Sounds great
Vitol						Sounds fine
Coastal						Perfect
Koch						Preferable
BP Canada					No problem with it
Chevron Canada					Would fill out the information
Engage Canada					Said that about 50% of the traders would take the time to give us the info.
TransCanada					They would fill it out
SaskEnergy Inc.				Not too excited about the deal but would consider it
Burlington Resources				Master User actually responded by sending a full list of user names, ids, emails and what they trade.
Unocal						Felt if we sent out a pop up survey about half of his traders would fill in the info.
CMS						Thought most traders would ignore a survey as they feel Enron has too much information about them already.  However, if 						we sent the Master User a form that would assist in a higher level of customer service, he would fill out the information.
BP Amoco					Felt most traders would ignore a survey unless they were forced to fill it out

 	 	    Dear Andrew,  ENL's Washington Correspondent Peter Cook and I had the chance to speak with newly-confirmed FERC Commissioner Pat Wood on Thursday.  Commissioner Wood discussed what role he would play within the FERC, the issue of price caps in California and the threat by Governor Gray Davis to sue the FERC.       Immediately following the Wood interview, I spoke with former FERC Commissioner Don Santa to get his reaction to the Gov. Davis lawsuit.  If you missed the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, catch both the Wood and Santa interviews in ENL's Video Library.    The House and Senate are still on recess, but our Washington bureau has much to cover on Friday.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford reports, with the House and Senate coming back to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, the change of power in the Senate could be decided sometime next week.  Jay says the bureau is scheduled to take a look at some of the comments and reactions from around Washington, and discuss what effect the power shift could have on President Bush's energy plan and the energy debate.  We'll have insight and discussion from our Washington bureau on Friday.     We're also scheduled to bring you segments from Correspondent Stephanie Stanton's trip to Florida.  She attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the Gulfstream Natural Gas Pipeline, which is a joint venture between Duke Energy and Williams Energy, parent company of ENL.  Catch coverage of Stephanie Stanton's trip on Friday.   Houston bureau Correspondent Kim Benestante reports she's scheduled to bring us details from a settlement reached between the Texas environmental agency TNRCC, and a group of refiners/utilities over reducing air emission in Texas.  Kim also says the bureau is scheduled to discuss the Texas Fresh Air Project.  The nation's largest residential retail provider of pollution-free electricity, Green Mountain Energy Company, is sponsoring the project.  We'll have these and other reports from the Houston bureau on Friday.     Also from Houston, I'm scheduled to speak with incoming Vice Chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers James Pappas.  He'll be discussing the upcoming Eastern Gulf of Mexico lease sale in the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast.  Don't miss the Pappas interview on Friday.

"EnronOnline charges","Has anything developed on this front?

We have revised the anticipated charge collection based on using standard brokerage fees and projecting 2001 volumes based on Q1 2001.

The total anticipated revenue is $69 million.

However, this is based on previous brokerage rate estimates which should be confirmed before we make any final decisions on this.

Please let me know if it looks like we are going to proceed with this and we will confirm the brokerage rates for each of the commodities.

Thanks,

Dave

"TFS / TradeSpark","Andy,
Mark Greenberg, myself and the attorney for TFS are working out the details for the definitive agreement.  The revised copy was sent out this afternoon.  If all goes well, it should close next week.  There are a few issues that could delay it but the chances of that happening are low.

TradeSpark was eager to see a contract.  I had an agreement sent out yesterday to Michael Williams that included North American Natural Gas, Power, Coal, Emissions, Broadband and Weather for $500,000.  Of course, Michael wanted to discuss putting the prices on TradeSpark.  I told him that the contract will only deal with the ability to transact on behalf of his clients.  Hopefully, we can leave it there but I doubt that's the last we'll hear of it.

Press Release
SOURCE: Ashton Technology Group, Inc. 
The Ashton Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiary of OptiMark Holdings, Inc.
Announce Strategic Investment and Bridge Financing
OptiMark Innovations Inc. to Provide Ashton With $30 Million in Intellectual
Property and Operating Capital; Other Parties Provide $500,000 Bridge
Financing
PHILADELPHIA & JERSEY CITY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 5, 2002-- The Ashton
Technology Group, Inc. (BB: ASTN.OB) and OptiMark Innovations Inc., a
corporation owned by affiliates of SOFTBANK Capital Partners and OptiMark,
Inc. (OptiMark), a wholly owned subsidiary of OptiMark Holdings, Inc.,
announced today the signing of a definitive agreement representing a
strategic investment in Ashton. 
Additionally, Ashton announced that HK Weaver Group Limited has agreed to
provide Ashton with up to $500,000 in bridge financing. 
As part of the agreement with Ashton, upon closing, OptiMark Innovations
will provide Ashton with assets valued at $30 million, including $10 million
in cash, as well as intellectual property, licenses and management
expertise. In return, OptiMark Innovations will own at least 80% of the
outstanding shares of Ashton. Closing of the transaction is contingent upon,
among other things, shareholder approval to increase the number of Ashton's
authorized shares, completion of certain creditor negotiations, closing of a
private equity investment in OptiMark Innovations and installation of a new
Board of Directors commensurate with OptiMark Innovation's ownership stake
in Ashton. 
Upon closing of the strategic investment, Ashton will, through broker-dealer
subsidiaries, offer a unique service for sell-side firms acting as agents,
to offer cost-effective guaranteed Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
orders to their clients. To provide these guaranteed VWAP orders, Ashton
will become a principal trading firm using state-of-the-art electronic
trading algorithms that over the past five years have demonstrated the
viability of this approach by achieving returns approximating VWAP. Ashton
will continue to operate its eVWAP
 facility for orders submitted
anonymously from buy-side institutions. 
Upon the closing of the transaction, Robert Warshaw, OptiMark's Chief
Executive, will become interim CEO of Ashton, replacing Fred Rittereiser.
Trevor Price, OptiMark's Executive Vice President for Product Strategy and
Marketing, will become Ashton's Chief Operating Officer. James Pak,
OptiMark's Executive Vice President for Strategic Development, will become
Ashton's Chief Financial Officer. Fred Weingard, Ashton's Chief Technology
Officer, will retain that position and his board seat. Additionally, William
Uchimoto will continue as Ashton General Counsel and a member of the
executive management team. Jennifer Andrews will keep her current
responsibilities and will assume the title of Executive Vice President,
Finance. 
Mr. Warshaw said, ``Ashton, under Fred Rittereiser's visionary leadership
and innovation, has laid the foundation for what we believe can become a
highly profitable business. We bring, in addition to needed operating
capital, the critical ability as principal traders, to provide liquidity and
guaranteed fills for VWAP orders for the sell-side firms.'' Mr. Warshaw
added that Mr. Rittereiser would serve as a special advisor to the Board of
Directors 
Mr. Rittereiser said, ``OptiMark Innovation's intellectual property,
technical support, operating capital and strong Wall Street relationships
were key ingredients in the strategic partnership. The combination will
create a stronger, well-capitalized firm which will accelerate the
implementation of a new competitive business model.'' 
New Ashton Management Team 
As part of the strategic relationship, OptiMark professionals will work with
Ashton to facilitate implementation of the technology, expedite the launch
of Ashton's new business and oversee the steps that the combined management
believes are necessary to make the company profitable. 
Mr. Warshaw has spent the last 21 years responsible for delivery of systems

Prior to Lazard, Mr. Warshaw was a partner at McKinsey & Company, in their
financial services practice. Mr. Warshaw has an undergraduate degree from
the University of Pennsylvania and a Masters in Management from Northwestern
University's Kellogg School of Management. 
Mr. Price has been responsible for identifying, evaluating and building new
business models that leverage OptiMark's state-of-the-art technology and
patents. Prior to Optimark, Mr. Price was Chairman, CEO and Founder of
SavvyJack, Inc., a business-to-business e-commerce application services
provider that enabled companies to market and sell their intellectual
capital. While at SavvyJack, Mr. Price was responsible for overall corporate
strategy, financing, strategic business development and sales. Prior to

<http://biz.yahoo.com/n/c/cnsw.html>). At Pagoda, he was responsible for
sales and product development. Pagoda was spun-out of Software Services
International, Inc., a global services capital firm with over 400 employees,
where Mr. Price held numerous operational and management positions. Mr.
Price has an undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Pak, OptiMark's Executive Vice President of Strategic Development, works

"RE: Joining the EnEx Energy Trading Exchange","Hi Lara,

I don't believe EnronOnline needs t approve access to other online platforms. PCG in Houston has been acting as the central party responsible for tracking and maintaining access to all third party platforms in North America. It is probably a good idea to do the same there as well. Give me a call if you have any questions.

Subject:	FW: Joining the EnEx Energy Trading Exchange

Please see the below request from the UK Gas desk about an online exchange they wish to join.

I think for awhile there had been talk about EnronOnline needing to somehow approve the access that Trading Desks had to other online platforms.  Is this still the case?

How do you wish to proceed?

Regards,
Lara

Subject:	Joining the EnEx Energy Trading Exchange

Matt of UK Gas has asked legal to have a look at the contract pursuant to which Enron would join EnEx.  EnEx is an online trading platform operated by EnMo Limited.  Subscribers must sign a one page contract pursuant to which they agree to be bound by the EnEx Rules.  Matt would like to sign up by 31 May  when EnEx goes live.  The purpose of becoming a subscriber is to trade NBP 7 day ahead gas contracts.  We will of course need to CACS the contract - Matt, we need to identify the relevant people who will sign the CACS, which will include transaction support and I would think IT.  Adam has prepared a summary of the Rules which is attached.
Two fundamental questions:
1. Does this conflict with EnronOnline,  either legally or commercially?  Legally, there are no restrictive covenants preventing Enron from being a member of or running other  trading platforms.  Commercially, I am copying this note to Justin who does the EnronOnline legal work and ask Justin to please check with the EnronOnline people.
2. Are we ready to comply with the Rules?  Note that there are also fees payable to be a subscriber.  Adam's summary will help, but all the relevant groups will need to have copies of the Rules and review them - I have one copy and can make additional ones.  Finally, I note that there is a standard form parent company guarantee in the package of documents - have we been asked to provide one?
I am copying in Guenther in tax and Oliver in credit to please look at this.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Andrew,  I'm Washington Correspondent Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts while he's on vacation this week.     On Wednesday, International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale brought us live reports from the final day of the 115th OPEC Conference in Vienna, Austria.  As promised, Wolfgang delivered an exclusive live interview with OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez in the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast.  Secretary General Rodriguez discussed OPEC production, exports, and the upcoming July 3rd OPEC meeting during the interview.  If you happened to miss Secretary General Rodriguez, click on ENL's Video Library to catch the interview in full.   We've been following the Electricity Emergency Relief Act markup from Washington for quite some time now, and on Wednesday the bill was suddenly tabled.  House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin says the measure lacked the bipartisan support necessary to continue the legislative process.     In Washington on Thursday we're going to continue to follow the change of power in the Senate.  We'll pay particular attention to the restructuring of the Senate Energy Committee.  We'll also have more on efforts to sell the President's energy plan to Congress.   The Houston bureau's Gale Smith reports on Thursday they'll continue to cover the trip of the Cote d'Ivoire Minister of Mines and Energy Emmanuel Leon Monnet to Houston.  He's meeting with Houston-based companies and officials about increasing oil and gas production along the Ivory Coast.     Also from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Omega Oil Company Executive Vice President of Operations Andy Ashby is scheduled to join us.  He'll discuss a reservoir production method for drilling and how this new technique is more cost efficient.  Log on Thursday for these stories and more from the Houston bureau.   ENL is going to California.  Next week we'll bring you reports from our brand new West Coast bureau based in Sacramento.  ENL Correspondent Kym McNicholas is headed to California for the summer to cover developments along the West Coast.  We're scheduled to bring you daily reports and live coverage from our West Coast bureau starting Monday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.   Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

"Re:","Attached is a draft memo to Accenture walking through the big issues.  As it turns out, there were way too many changes in our draft to go through many of them in any detail, and the memo basically says ""We think this is a better approach and please don't blow up and go crazy until you have read the whole thing and thought about it"" -- but I still think it's useful to send it out.  Also attached is a suggested definition for ""Enron Platform"" --

Rosh, I'm sending over some hand-marked comments for your review -- one significant point is that I think we need a definition of ""Data Services"" that defines exactly what Accenture will do (reformatting Customer-Specific Transaction Data and providing it to Qualified  Customers in an electronic format, but not including mid-or back-office services (which we may also want to define) -- some of the provisions (like the exclusivity) will be easier to grasp if we have a term describing what Accenture will provide.

I will be out starting at 11:00 for the Legal Department PRC (maybe out for the rest of the day), so if we can talk before then to get this wrapped up, that would be great

Attached for your review is a revised draft of the Licensing Agreement with
Accenture.  Ted has reviewed the draft and his comments are reflected.  We
look forward to finalizing and making the distribution to Accenture on
Monday.

Following are some thoughts for your consideration:

1.            Definition of Enron Platform.  Andy's definition of ""Enron
Platform"" excluded products substantially dissimilar to those listed on the
platform, to which we added the qualification of listed on the platform as
of the Effective Date.  Is this correct?  In addition, is there a
possibility that Enron might split up the platform (i.e., by product type),
and then sell off certain segments?  If so, we may need to further modify
the definition.

2.         License Grants.  Though the license grant with respect to
Customer-Specific Transaction Data in Section 3.1 is limited to Accenture's
right to re-format the data, we advise adding some restrictions to
specifically negate their right to manipulate the data in certain ways, as
per your previous business discussions.  In addition, with respect to the
SmartClient Software license in Section 3.3, Accenture will be permitted to
freely modify the software for their own purposes, except to the extent the
software is being used for receiving data through the Enron Data Feed.  We
need to confirm that the appropriate restrictions have been imposed.

3.            Minimum Annual Payments.  Section 5.1(b) provides that the
Minimum Annual Payment is due at the end of each Contract Year.  Is this
satisfactory from the accounting perspective, or do we want more flexibility
for purposes of booking these payments?

4.         Audit Rights.  In Section 5.4(b), we have added a limited right
to do an operational audit, i.e., the audit can be initiated only on claim
of breach, and can be performed only by a third party.  We would like to
discuss expanding this right.

5.            Acceleration Rights on Termination.  Section 7.6(b) permits us
to accelerate the Minimum Annual Payments on Accenture's default for breach
of contract.  Is this the appropriate trigger?

6.            Accenture Warranties.  Should we add any warranties to Section
8.2?

7.            Accenture Indemnity.  We have expanded Accenture's indemnity
obligation in Section 9.2(a), to cover any claims arising out the TSH
Services or their modifications to the SmartClient Software.  The only

We have received a request from a free-lance journalist, who is writing an article on online energy exchanges.  The article will appear in Cisco IQ, which is a Cisco publication for both internal and external audiences.  EnronOnline is not the only subject.  His interest is in what is it, hwo it works, the future...basically a general overview.

Do we have any interest?

Subject:	EOL Team Connection to Operations

I left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you to call - am sure that it is a busy Monday.  I will send this note so that I don't forget the purpose.  With Savita assuming the role previously played by Sheri with regard to the Product Control group, I wanted to underscore the importance of a free flow of information between the EOL team and my operations team.  One of the roles that Sheri's team fulfilled was keeping my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within EOL that can have an impact on bridging to our legacy systems.  I may have met Savita once in passing.  I checked with Jeff Gossett and Stacey White, risk leads over gas and power, respectively, and neither one has heard of or met Savita.  Although Jennifer Denney will play an active role, I know that she will be out on maternity leave soon, so it is important for Savita to know the right players on the operations team and for them to know her.  I will contact Savita directly to make the appropriate introductions.  I just wanted your support and encouragement for Savita in making the right connections within operations.  --Sally

Louise,

Congrats on the new baby!  Babies are truly a miracle.  Best of luck with
it.  I hope you saw all the movies that you wanted prior to delivery,
because it will be years before you see the inside of a movie theatre.

I know you are on maternity leave, but if you happen to get this email,
please give me a call.  Unfortunately, we are headed down a path right now
that could get very messy between HoustonStreet and Enron.  I want to avoid
that if at all possible.  There has been a level of frustration in the
communication and cooperation between our teams.  If we could both sides to
cooperate and focus for a couple of days, I am confident we can iron out any
issues and be prepared to go live within a week.

We have a number of big players that are eagerly awaiting the launch of our
link because they want to trade with Enron in a neutral, third party
environment.  I also know for a fact that there are back office integration
opportunities that we can pursue together that would be difficult for Enron
to pursue alone.

Congratulations again on your new child.

Best regards,
Frank

"RE: John Cummings Update","Understood.  Please know that when I do travel I do take efforts to get the most out of the trip and keep my expenses to a minimum.  You have been very busy lately and I have been keeping Dave Forster informed as to my actions and what I was up to.   I will try to do a better job of getting you feedback/guidance and letting you know what I am doing.

On an unrelated issues.  It would be good to get guidance from you on how you want us to handle breaking up the markets.  You have assigned 2 and in some cases 3  people on each market.  Are we supposed to split up the companies, work together as a team on deals, or what.  With Jake for example, he does not really have energy background, so I am a little reluctant putting him in front of a high probability prospect by himself.  I have tried to bring along Jake or Leonardo to the meetings I have been having.  For local meetings that is okay, but there may be a few meetings in the future that will require travel and if expenses are an issue, how do you want to handle this?  You do not need to answer this now, but if you could think about it and give me a few comments I would appreciate it.

"RE: TibCo Follow up","Greg --

I definitely agree with your assessment.  We have a few other fish to chase right now before we give up the boat.

A few thoughts:  TIBCO is proposing a sales channel arrangement that essentially keeps Enron very much in the software business.  If we decide that we are comfortable having a foot in the software business for a period of time, we can always sign up sales channels, including TIBCO, whenever we are ready to do so.  Collaborating with a channel partner is a lot of work; in fact, initially it is actually more difficult than doing everything yourself.  So before we jump into the channels world, we would need to decide that we are ready to put the resources to the effort.  Regards.

Subject:	Follow up


Greg,
 
Thanks again for  our discussion of last week.  As we discussed, TIBCO remains  very interested in collaborating with Enron on the commercialization of the  Enron Online software.  We agree that a significant part of the challenge  with commercializing a software asset like Enron Online is to get it ""out  of the starting blocks;"" that is, to get the first few customer sales that  set a full-scale market opportunity in motion.  
 
We  would like to work with Enron to overcome the ""starting blocks""  challenge by acting as the sales and marketing agent for the software.   Enron would retain all IP, but grant the right to resell the software to  TIBCO.  As a reseller, TIBCO would share in the revenue from the sale of  the software.  For reselling, we would typically receive up to 45% of the  sale, depending upon the precise nature of TIBCO's responsibilites for the  marketing and selling activities.  Similar to our discussions to date,  Enron involvement in the sales process would remain critical.  The  involvement of an SI like Accenture would also continue to be important, but  TIBCO would act as the primary sales agent and apply its marketing capabilities  and sales force to selling the Enron software.  Again, we would be passing  the Enron software through our sales channels without owning any of the  IP.  Based on 6 months to 1 year of activity we could then revisit whether  or not Enron is interested in selling the IP to TIBCO.
 
In  addition, though, we also believe there is a bigger opportunity for TIBCO and  Enron to collaborate that would yield greater benefitsfor both parties.  That is, Enron could take an equity stake in TIBCO as  part of a larger agreement for TIBCO to generally act as the partner for  commercialization of Enron software assets.  We assume  that Enron has multiple software assets it would consider commercializing and a  broader agreement with TIBCO would enable Enron to establish a process for  software commercialization that could be repeated for multiple assets.  The  nature of the agreement between Enron and TIBCO would be broader than just  resale, in that TIBCO would assume the responsibility for all aspects of turning  the asset into a packaged software product and developing the related marketing  programs, in addition to selling the products.  Enron would still retain  the IP to the software assets, however.  Also, as a TIBCO investor, Enron  would see value not only in the revenue from software sold but also in the  appreciation of TIBCO stock, and all this value would accrue without Enron  giving up any IP.  
 
Obviously, this approach yields value over time from a software asset  rather than up front, but it offers five key benefits.  First, it  provides a repeatable process for commercialization of Enron software  assets--not just Enron Online; second, it overcomes the ""starting  blocks"" problem while allowing Enron to retain its IP and still take  advantage of TIBCO's software commercialization processes and expertise; third,  it allows Enron to receive revenue from both software sales and TIBCO stock  appreciation; and, fifth, it creates a larger software commercialization  framework that should have value in and of itself.
 
We  hope that we can find a way to work with Enron on its software commercialization  efforts, and we'd like to continue to explore the ideas here, in addition to any  variations you may see as alternatives.
 
Thanks,
 
 
Murray

"Companies and Areas","Andy,

Following is a list of Areas and Companies which was previously circulated among the group. These represent the companies and areas which we felt had the greatest potential.

Since we originally prepared the list, we have started chasing gas Storage companies. Bob and I are meeting with Paul Bieniawski (Enron Storage Origination) on Wednesday to put together the US target list.

We have not yet pursued the Energy companies as we felt the overlap with Enron's core EnronOnline activities would be too strong.

John Cummings is in the process of putting together a pulp and paper list.

The areas which I see as candidates for our primary focus are:

	Agriculture
	Chemicals
	FX
	Gas Storage
	Pipelines
	Pulp and Paper


Would appreciate your thoughts . . .

Abraham and the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Plant, log on to ENL's Video Library to view the segment in its entirety.       The House and Senate are on Memorial Day recess for the rest of the week, and they're scheduled to reconvene on June 5.  While it's relatively quiet in Washington, ENL's Washington bureau is keeping an eye on President Bush's trip to California.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford says tomorrow they'll have updates from the meeting between the President and Governor Gray Davis.  They'll also continue to follow the President in California as he travels to Fresno and Sequoia National Park on Wednesday.   Also on Wednesday, the FERC is scheduled to conduct a regular meeting.  It is unclear whether newly confirmed FERC Commissioners Nora Brownell and Pat Wood will take part in the meeting.   Finally, from our D.C. bureau on Wednesday, Competitive Enterprise Institute's Christopher Horner is scheduled to join us.  He'll discuss the defection of Sen. James Jeffords from the Republican Party and the effect this move may have on the national energy policy.  Log on to see the Horner interview in the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.

"Employee Referral Program","


	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

      <p>Dear Andrew,</p> 
<!-- This mail was sent to ""Andrew Zipper"" <andy.zipper@enron.com>, who belongs to list
enl-members-html -->
<!-- CONTENT START -->

<p>I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.
<p>Just a reminder - On Friday, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante is
<b>live in Cairo, Egypt covering the OPEC meeting</b>.  Join us tomorrow
as Kim brings us the <b>latest on possible oil production cuts beginning
in January</b>.   
<p>We'll also have more reaction from here in Washington to the <b>OPEC
meeting.  American Petroleum Institute Chief Economist John Felmy,
Ph.D.</b>, will share his thoughts on the cartel's moves and <b>what
they might mean for the U.S.</b>  Also during the 12:00 p.m. ET
newscast, <b>The Petroleum Finance Company Senior Market Analyst George
Beranek</b> will give <b>us his assessment of the market</b> if OPEC
follows through with a production cut.
<p>The <b>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</b> has had a very busy
year - from the California crisis to the crisis at Enron, the Commission
has had a full docket.  On Friday during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast,
we'll hear what <b>former FERC Chairman James Hoecker</b> thinks about
the past year at the FERC and what issues may surface during the New
Year.
<p>As the year draws to a close, the <b>Houston bureau will take a look
back</b> at one of the biggest energy stories - <b>the collapse of the
energy giant, Enron</b>.  Houston Bureau Chief Myra Jolivet says on
Friday, the Houston bureau will <b>review the timetable of Enron's
demise</b>, the effects of its bankruptcy filing, layoffs and the
company's downgraded credit rating. 
<p>As <b>Texas deregulation</b> nears, competition in the market is
heating up among retail energy providers.  The Houston bureau says the
<b>Texas Public Utility Commission set the price to beat</b> for areas
in the state, and <b>competing retail energy providers are beating those
prices</b>.  We'll have all the details from the Houston bureau on
Friday.
<p>West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says on Friday, <b>California
Senator Debra Bowen</b> talks about what to expect from the legislature
in the first few weeks of 2002.  Kym says possible topics of discussion
include the <b>issuance of the state's $12.5 billion in energy
bonds</b>, the <b>California Power Authority</b> and <b>plans to get
Southern California Edison and PG&E out of debt</b>.
<p>Also on Friday from the West Coast bureau, <b>California Energy
Commissioner Michael Moore</b> talks about the <b>gas supplies in
California</b>.  Join us for these reports and more from Sacramento
tomorrow.

"FERC Inquiry into Electronic Trading (&EOL)","Today, we received a letter from FERC notifying us that they are initiating an inquiry to increase ""their understanding of the scope and development of electronic trading in electric power and natural gas markets.""   FERC is requesting that EnronOnline ""cooperate"" with the inquiry.  The letter states that they will be sending us a request for information, and visiting our offices in Houston.  

We're not certain what FERC is after with this inquiry, but wanted to make sure you were aware of this development.   We are looking into this, and will get back to you asap with further information.

"RE: Clearing discussion","I heard Whalley was neutral to the London Clearing thing.  

My take on it is that we want both the trade and the information associated with it like who it was, etc.  In theory, that is true.  The question is that in reality, is that sustainable.  In gas and power U. S., other than ICE we are able to do that for the most part.

Andy Zipper had a good idea and is focusing on a subset of this which is finding a way for hedge funds, institutions and locals to get at our liquidity through a clearing agent.  These entities do not transact currently on EnronOnline because of credit restrictions so if we could set up a master user, like a clearing agent, then the agent would set up sub users like the funds and/or locals.  This should not effect Whalley's concern because all these trades, though anonymous, would be incremental.

Your thoughts?

Subject:	Recommended Offer by ICE for IPE Holdings

This is to point out to you the approaching deadline for accepting ICE's Offer for IPE Holdings.  If we wish to accept this Offer, we must do so no later than 3 pm on Tuesday 29 May.

In the meantime, Michael has received calls from Richard Ward (IPE's CEO) inquiring as to our position, and it would be my view that we should accept the Offer. (Note that if ICE receives acceptances of 90% or more, then our shares in IPE Holdings will in any event be mandatorily acquired.  And assuming that such level of acceptances will be received, there is no reason for not accepting the Offer).

Please would you let me know whether you wish to accept the Offer.  Ideally, if we are to do so, I would plan to send the acceptance by close of business on Friday 25 May.


Thanks
Justin

"Cargill NDA status","Mike:

As we discussed a few minutes ago, here is the latest and greatest NDA between us and Cargill.  As I mentioned, Greg has been extremely focused on getting NDA's in place before substantive discussions occur, so we'll need to get this in place before our next significant interaction with Cargill.

Note Greenberg's comments.  Given the events of the last few days, I haven't followed up with our Cargill contacts yet, but we promised them we'd get back to them by yesterday.  I would like to hear from Andy on the non-solicitation issue, but in my mind it should not be a problem to concede this point to Cargill.  It looks like our lawyers would pop a blood vessel if we conceded on the Minnesota/New York law issue; maybe we concede on the first and they concede on the second.

I will also forward you (via separate e-mail) the other key communications we have had with Cargill.

Jake and I are looking forward to transitioning this and our other agricultural contacts over to you as soon as possible.  Please let me know when we can discuss this, and we can call Cargill this afternoon.

Best regards,

Mike

Jake -

The Cargill changes are acceptable except for (1) the deletion of the non-solicitation provisions and (2) the change back to Minnesota law.  The non-solicitation provision is a business call and relates to the disclosures being made and individuals involved in the project.  If Cargill will have contact with key EOL IT personnel, the non-solicitation should be part of the agreement.  As to the change of law, we cannot accept Minnesota and must have New York as this is a neutral forum.

Hello,
This is Paul Weinberger, senior recruiter EWS working with Ryan Seleznov. Last Week I met with Andy Zipper who wants me to find orginators with an e-ccomerce combination background. I am attaching three resumes in hopes that you can give me feedback so I can better help your department. This feedback helps me zone in on exactly what to look for. If there is a time we can meet that would be great or please respond via email.

Subject:	Wharton

Guys--

First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! (details please, at your earliest chance)

Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums (coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton.

 The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level.  
Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.

Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and corporate executives.

O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??

As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, references, course work, etc. 

A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an ""Enron brain drain"" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron).   

The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the 
financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion.

ALL comments solicited----

Many thanks!!

--Christie.

Subject:	ICG/Wharton Forum meeting May 31-June 1


Christie,

Lee Goldring, our new Forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you
to introduce himself and follow up on Enron's representation at the next
meeting.  I'm emailing this information to you to alert you to the situation
since I do not think you would want Enron to go unrepresented at the next
meeting. To date, no one from Enron has registered for the Forum sponsored
Online Conversion Workshop,  the Forum meeting on 5/31 or the Members Only
meeting on 6/1.  Please note that the ""From Browsers to Buyers: Online
Conversion Workshop"" on May 30th is purely optional in case some folks from
Enron are interested in attending.  Since the Forum is co-sponsoring the
Workshop -- WeBI affiliated registrants will not be charged the $495
registration fee as an added benefit for their sponsorship.

Here are all the relevent links to the Forum agenda and registration sites
for your convenience:

"FW: Schedule for Tuesday PM.","Attached is a proposed test plan from HoustonStreet for tomorrow.  I have reserved conference room 2712 beginning at 2:30 tomorrow and will escort HoustonStreet onto our floor at 2:30 tomorrow.  They will be allowed to set up machines from 2:30 to 3:00.  At 3:00 we will allow HoustonStreet to discuss their plan prior to our review.

Enron has terminated the price posting agreement and has no obligation to do testing.  We have simply agreed to review their system. 

During the review  anyone working with HoustonStreet should refrain from making any comments (positive or negative) concerning the performance of the system.  We will simply take the review under advisement.  

All discussions with HoustonStreet should be handled by myself or Savita.  

If you have any questions call me on 30397.

Bob,
I'll give you a call in the AM to see about lunch.

We would like to get started between 2-2:30 setting up the machines that we
will be using during the demonstration.  This should take approximately 1/2
hour to download the correct .CAB files and ensure that the application
installs correctly.  We will need to have administrative rights on these
machines in order to facilitate the installation.

At 3:00 if we could start in a conference room for approximately 15 minutes
we can review the demonstration scenarios and our objectives.
From 3:20 - 3:40 we will run through the demo scenario 1.
From 3:40 - 4:00 we will run through the demo scenario 2.
From 4:00 - 4:45 will be a free form testing time.
From 4:45 - 5:00 wrap-up, review, Q&A.

I'm getting ready to head to the airport - If you have any questions etc,
don't hesitate to give me a call on my cell phone - 603-591-9004.  Thanks,

Subject:	Broker Client for Metals AE's

Here is what I think we could do:

1). We set up a new counterparty type that represents a voice trade submitted through an Enron Internal ID. This is to allow non-registered EOL users to contact their AE and have their credit checked by EOL during transaction process. The system would know then not to check for ETA, GTC etc, etc. We would then load these internal counterparty types into the ""Internal BrokerClient"" for use by AE's.

2). This counterparty type will be flagged to execute at submitted price as opposed to better of submitted or available. This way originators can embed margin in their deals and have the transactions execute and bridge at the price with the margin in it.

I think we could do this with a 1 to 2 week development effort.

"FW: Joining the EnEx Energy Trading Exchange","Please see the below request from the UK Gas desk about an online exchange they wish to join.

I think for awhile there had been talk about EnronOnline needing to somehow approve the access that Trading Desks had to other online platforms.  Is this still the case?

How do you wish to proceed?

Subject:	Joining the EnEx Energy Trading Exchange

Matt of UK Gas has asked legal to have a look at the contract pursuant to which Enron would join EnEx.  EnEx is an online trading platform operated by EnMo Limited.  Subscribers must sign a one page contract pursuant to which they agree to be bound by the EnEx Rules.  Matt would like to sign up by 31 May  when EnEx goes live.  The purpose of becoming a subscriber is to trade NBP 7 day ahead gas contracts.  We will of course need to CACS the contract - Matt, we need to identify the relevant people who will sign the CACS, which will include transaction support and I would think IT.  Adam has prepared a summary of the Rules which is attached.
Two fundamental questions:
1. Does this conflict with EnronOnline,  either legally or commercially?  Legally, there are no restrictive covenants preventing Enron from being a member of or running other  trading platforms.  Commercially, I am copying this note to Justin who does the EnronOnline legal work and ask Justin to please check with the EnronOnline people.
2. Are we ready to comply with the Rules?  Note that there are also fees payable to be a subscriber.  Adam's summary will help, but all the relevant groups will need to have copies of the Rules and review them - I have one copy and can make additional ones.  Finally, I note that there is a standard form parent company guarantee in the package of documents - have we been asked to provide one?
I am copying in Guenther in tax and Oliver in credit to please look at this.
Regards, Rahul x. 35470

Subject:	RE: re:stuff

I did confirm that Dow is now an asset deal with no interest by Dow in ENW products.

I think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity (i.e. ICE) and think about tsomething that is at least 50% of that. and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee.

A bit of good news: NGPL has confirmed that they would like to do a 2yr product hosting deal on EnronOnline.
$150K initial startup plus $100K per year and $25 per transaction. So total value not including per transaction is $350K. I think they get 5 products, but Forster knows the details. It's a start and the crew here is pretty pumped.

I'm trying to get a lieutenant of Viol'a to work with but it is hard. Patience.

Let's meet on Monday to talk about what we were going to do on Friday.

I am in the office picking up some Stro's tix. It sure is quiet for a Saturday...creepy.

OpenLink is one of the leaders in risk management systems. We used at Coral, and it was then called Abacus. It is strongest in front office risk management. I would view their competition as KioDex. The deal with Duke has been around for awhile.

"RE: Partnership: Enron & TechSpan (Goldman Sachs Funded Company)","Dear Andy

Thanks for your Mail. I sincerely hope you were able to get a high level
overview of our company. Further to my earlier mail, i am enclosing the
information which could provide further insight into our company. Pls
include them in your assessment process and give me a feedback if you
require any further clarification. We look forward to meeting you and your
team for an  presentation and the value we could bring to Enron. In the
presentation, we would cover our Methodology, Processes, Competencies,
Clients , Case Study & our economical/cost effective deployment processes.

Some synergies i perceive; Enron's initiative in ClickPaper could map well
based on our experience in Forest Express , EnronOnline could map into our
experience with RMX/Chevron or American Petroleum Exchange, Dealbench.com
maps well with our experience with eBreviate on the hosted ASP model for
eRFP,Auctions,Supplier Search. Moreoever, our development labs in India
could add great value for your module development, ongoing support,
maintenance, QA, Porting work; deploying a very low cost structure.

1.	TechSpan Details: I have enclosed the following -

	1.1 Company Overview (Management, Revenues, Growth, Locations,
Services, Competencies,  etc)
	1.2 TechSpan B2B Markets Expertise Brochure
	1.3 Case Study - e2Open , Traiana
	1.4 Projects with Ariba & MOAI

2.	Other Details which could be of interest

	2.1 TechSpan has been featured on IDC's analysis (Report No. 23918)

	"" IDC believes that TechSpan has done a good job of melding its
evolution as a services business to that of its 	partnerhips""

	2.2.  BEA's Partner brochure on its competency (attachment), wherein
TechSpan has been evaluated at par with KPMG & 	CSC. All our clients have
also realized the value in TechSpan and all have positioned us equivalent
(and higher in many 	cases)to any Big 5 Consulting firm.

	2.3.  INDIAN E-BIZ CONSULTING MARKET WORTH $136 M.: V&D

	TechSpan tops the Big Six list of e-biz consultants in India with
total business worth $67 million, followed by 	Planetasia and MindTree. The
study has identified pricing as the one big advantage enjoyed by Indian pure
play 	Internet Professional Services companies.

     	http://ciol.com/content/news/repts/101020511.asp?nl=ctd-mar5

	2.4  Inc. Magazine and Cisco Systems Name TechSpan, Inc., Finalist
at Growing with Technology Awards Ceremony

	2.5.  TechSpan Ranked on Sm@rtReseller's Smart 100 Companies List

      http://www.techspan.com/news/prsmartreseller.html


In summary, we are a young company (two years in operations) with high
ambitions and clearly articulated vision of being a leader in the e-commerce
consulting space. We have achieved major milestones in being a $ 67.0
Million company within 2 years, largely due to the confidence exhibited by
our customers and partners. Though the above are some achievements in the
past (giving you a base comfort factor on our long term stability), we are
keen in discussing what value we could bring to Enron, now and in the
future.

Thks,

The Scoop	
  <http://www.money.net/40images/clear.gif>

The blue chip rally never really developed any upside momentum today as evidenced by the very choppy trading pattern.  While the tech dominated Nasdaq has outperformed, the key leadership group (semiconductor) has come under some profit taking pressure.

 	 	    Dear Andrew,  I'm Washington Correspondent Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts while he's on vacation this week.     International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale brought us live reports on Tuesday from the 115th OPEC Conference in Vienna, Austria.  Wolfgang had a live interview with OPEC President Chakib Khelil in the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast.  Khelil discussed OPEC production, Western demand, and prices.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to resume its markup of the Electricity Emergency Relief Act Wednesday morning.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford and I will be following the markup as well as the official power shift expected in the Senate tomorrow.

We'll keep you updated on these and other stories from the Washington bureau on Wednesday.   From the Houston bureau on Wednesday, Correspondent Kim Benestante is scheduled to bring us a report on training programs some companies are implementing to prepare high school and college students for careers in the energy industry.

Subject:	possible opportunity with Enron

Dear Mr. Bibi and Mr. Piper,

I am currently working as a V.P. at Commerce One managing the Global Trading
Web and have followed Enron's e-commerce activities for some time. I am
currently exploring other career opportunities.  I contacted Louise Kitchen
who suggested that you were the best  people to get in touch with regarding
my interest in contributing to Enron's online initiative. I previously
worked at the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the FCC, the State Dept,
and Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue. I not only have experience in the B2B world
through my work at Commerce One, but also in e-commerce generally, trade and
telecommunications through these other positions. This combination of
experience could be helpful to Enron in expanding your B2B effort, including
governance and interoperability issues, developing new business, and in
dealing with domestic and international regulatory matters related to
e-commerce.

A copy of my resume is attached. If either of you have a few moments to
talk, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks and best regards,

Ed

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Andrew,  There's a probability of a shift in power in Washington as rumors surround Senator Jim Jeffords (R-VT).  Washington officials are saying Sen. Jeffords is planning to abandon the Republican Party, although no one is certain whether he'll become a Democrat or an Independent.  Either way, the move would give Democrats the Senate majority, which could have a major impact on the Bush administration's ability to implement its national energy policy.  Sen. Jeffords has scheduled a press conference from Vermont on Thursday morning, and ENL's Washington bureau will bring you details on his announcement.   Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford reports the House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to mark up the Electricity Emergency Relief Act on Thursday.  Jay expects Democrats to once again attempt to include price caps on wholesale power in the markup.       Jay also reports, next week President Bush is scheduled to travel to California to assess the energy situation.  While there, Bush is expected to meet with Governor Gray Davis to discuss energy policy.  ENL's Washington bureau will be following developments surrounding the President's trip next week.   Also from our DC bureau, I'm scheduled to speak with former Chairman of the Senate Energy and Environmental Resources Committee Bennett Johnston.  He's scheduled to join us in the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast.   On tap from the Houston bureau on Thursday:  Correspondent Kim Benestante reports the Texas House of Representatives has approved subsidies toward a bill that would drastically cut diesel emissions in the state.  The Houston bureau will also bring us a report on an upcoming meeting between Enron and India officials about payment for power.  We'll have all the details from these stories and more from the Houston bureau on Thursday.       Also from the Houston bureau, Bureau Chief of the Energy Intelligence Group Barbara Shook is scheduled to join us on Thursday.  She'll discuss a state-of-the-art Shell Gas to Liquids terminal in Malaysia that turns gas into emissions-free diesel fuel.  Catch these and other stories from Houston on Thursday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

He has a meeting with Phil Lynch at 11 our time regarding:

Ed and I agreed that more resources are necessary to i.) make EnronOnline Real Time Quotes successful and ii.) to fully develop other business opportunities that may arise between our companies (specifically time and sales daily updates and historical transactions)

Ed told me that Reuters is looking at creating an Enron Strategic Relationship position.  Ed thinks that it is between him, Rob Garfield some lady from London.  I told Ed that we would support him in that role but he needs more resources and more stroke.

"Request for Interview","We have received a request from a free-lance journalist, who is writing an article on online energy exchanges.  The article will appear in Cisco IQ, which is a Cisco publication for both internal and external audiences.  EnronOnline is not the only subject.  His interest is in what is it, hwo it works, the future...basically a general overview.

Do we have any interest?

Dear Lydia,

It was great speaking with you. I was advised by  Ms. Kitchen's
office to touch base with Mr. Zipper for a presentation. As we
discussed, I am enclosing a brief profile of Daksh for your review.

e-mail, chat etc.) for both eBusiness and traditional-economy
players embracing the web. Our clients include Amazon.com,
Intuit Inc. and PayPal Inc. (the largest Internet payment
service with over 6 million customers). We are currently
operating at an annualized volume of about 3 million
e-interactions and transact with over 30 million customers
in the US on behalf of our clients. We have now close
to 650 people and have extensive experience on multiple
contact management platforms including Kana, eShare,
Mombassa, Siebel, Talisma, Amazon.com proprietary
platform etc.

You could also visit our website www.daksh.com
<http://www.daksh.com>, to learn more about our company,
the team and services we offer.

Key benefits we offer include:

* Unique co-sourcing model (operating through dedicated
  teams, customized processes and close-knit relationships)

longer conversation on this opportunity with our

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

 	  	 Dear Andrew,

Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) says he is unsure whether an energy bill will reach the Senate floor this year. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says Senator Bingaman is also downplaying the chances that a new Republican energy proposal will alter the debate significantly. The bureau will have the latest from the Hill on Friday. 

Also from Washington on Friday, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency Robert Priddle will discuss the world's energy supply within the context of the campaign against terrorism. Priddle is speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies tomorrow, and the Washington bureau will bring us all the details. 

Energy Markets Washington Editor Jack Belcher will join us from the Washington bureau on Friday. Belcher is stopping by during the 
9:00 a.m. ET newscast to discuss the EPA's new boutique fuels proposal. 

The Independent Petroleum Association of America will continue a three-day meeting in Houston on Friday. Interior Secretary 
Gale Norton and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham are among those attending the meeting. Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will have details on the meeting from the Houston bureau on Friday. 

Also from Houston, Spinnaker Exploration CEO and Founder 
Roger Jarvis will discuss his company's third-quarter earnings results. Join us during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast for the Jarvis interview. And catch Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research 
Mark Meyer as he talks about how oil stocks are doing this quarter. We'll bring you these interviews from Houston on Friday. 

From the West Coast bureau on Friday, ENL's Kym McNicholas will bring us a report on the extra security measures being taken to protect the Hoover Dam. The dam has 17 generators, each capable of supplying electricity to 100,000 households. Catch the Hoover Dam report from the West Coast bureau tomorrow. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"FW: e-commerce in base metals...(Enron mention)","Guys

Please see article attached.  Pages 3 and 4 are interesting.  Page 3 discusses the options functionality available on the various platforms and Page 4 refers to the demutualisation of the LME leading to the possibility that LME Select may offer OTC contracts (similar to enymex).

Article also talks about LME Select enabling automated data transfer to the LME matching system.

"FERC","Andy,

Sarah Novosel called from our Washington office. 

As you know, FERC have requested to learn about EnronOnline.

They would like to come here on the afternoon of Tuesday, June 5 and receive our standard public presentation (one of the people coming is a person whom I presented to several months ago and he requested that we give the same presentation again, but updated for current data).

I am available that afternoon and can do the presentation. Would you like to attend as well or instead of me?

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Greg,
 
Thanks again for  our discussion of last week.  As we discussed, TIBCO remains  very interested in collaborating with Enron on the commercialization of the  Enron Online software.  We agree that a significant part of the challenge  with commercializing a software asset like Enron Online is to get it ""out  of the starting blocks;"" that is, to get the first few customer sales that  set a full-scale market opportunity in motion.  
 
We  would like to work with Enron to overcome the ""starting blocks""  challenge by acting as the sales and marketing agent for the software.   Enron would retain all IP, but grant the right to resell the software to  TIBCO.  As a reseller, TIBCO would share in the revenue from the sale of  the software.  For reselling, we would typically receive up to 45% of the  sale, depending upon the precise nature of TIBCO's responsibilites for the  marketing and selling activities.  Similar to our discussions to date,  Enron involvement in the sales process would remain critical.  The  involvement of an SI like Accenture would also continue to be important, but  TIBCO would act as the primary sales agent and apply its marketing capabilities  and sales force to selling the Enron software.  Again, we would be passing  the Enron software through our sales channels without owning any of the  IP.  Based on 6 months to 1 year of activity we could then revisit whether  or not Enron is interested in selling the IP to TIBCO.
 
In  addition, though, we also believe there is a bigger opportunity for TIBCO and  Enron to collaborate that would yield greater benefitsfor both parties.  That is, Enron could take an equity stake in TIBCO as  part of a larger agreement for TIBCO to generally act as the partner for  commercialization of Enron software assets.  We assume  that Enron has multiple software assets it would consider commercializing and a  broader agreement with TIBCO would enable Enron to establish a process for  software commercialization that could be repeated for multiple assets.  The  nature of the agreement between Enron and TIBCO would be broader than just  resale, in that TIBCO would assume the responsibility for all aspects of turning  the asset into a packaged software product and developing the related marketing  programs, in addition to selling the products.  Enron would still retain  the IP to the software assets, however.  Also, as a TIBCO investor, Enron  would see value not only in the revenue from software sold but also in the  appreciation of TIBCO stock, and all this value would accrue without Enron  giving up any IP.  
 
Obviously, this approach yields value over time from a software asset  rather than up front, but it offers five key benefits.  First, it  provides a repeatable process for commercialization of Enron software  assets--not just Enron Online; second, it overcomes the ""starting  blocks"" problem while allowing Enron to retain its IP and still take  advantage of TIBCO's software commercialization processes and expertise; third,  it allows Enron to receive revenue from both software sales and TIBCO stock  appreciation; and, fifth, it creates a larger software commercialization  framework that should have value in and of itself.
 
We  hope that we can find a way to work with Enron on its software commercialization  efforts, and we'd like to continue to explore the ideas here, in addition to any  variations you may see as alternatives.
 
Thanks,
 
 
Murray

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"RE: Market segmentation","Coal is an area we hadn't thought of. I suspect it might prove difficult, but it's worth investigating.

My perspective on suggested assignments:

Ag : Mike Bridges/Carl Carter
Petchems/Chems: DISCUSS
Coal: DISCUSS
NGL's (storage and terminaling):DISCUSS
Energy (Gas and Power): Suggest we revise the list and agree strategy before anyone is assigned to chase.
Energy (Crude and Refined): John Cummings
Gas Storage: Bob Shults/Leonardo Pacheco
Pipelines:Dave F/Carl Carter
Pulp and Paper: John Cummings
Financial Services: Dave F/Mike Bridges
Legacy: As currently contacted

The ones I have marked DISCUSS are ones which might be split amongst John Pavetto, John Allario, Mike Haney and Jake Staffel.

Also: There might be some worth in bandwidth, which is not on the list.

Relevant Experience

Bob Shults used to deal with gas storage and knows some of the players.
John Cummings used to trade oil before getting into Pulp and Paper.
Mike B. and Carl have both traded in ags.
Mike B. and I have held or have scheduled meetings with RBC, Bank of Nova Scotia, CIBC, TD.
Carl was responsible for getting the Enron pipes off the ground on EnronOnline and is familiar with their products.

Coal

NGL's (storage and terminaling)
	

Energy Trading
	-Gas & Power
	-Crude and Refined (with particular emphasis on Supply and Trading orgs of majors and independents)

Gas Storage

Pulp+paper

Financial Services (Banks and Brokers)

Legacy (GM, Coke)

The rest let's forget.

Subject:	Recommended Offer by ICE for IPE Holdings

This is to point out to you the approaching deadline for accepting ICE's Offer for IPE Holdings.  If we wish to accept this Offer, we must do so no later than 3 pm on Tuesday 29 May.

In the meantime, Michael has received calls from Richard Ward (IPE's CEO) inquiring as to our position, and it would be my view that we should accept the Offer. (Note that if ICE receives acceptances of 90% or more, then our shares in IPE Holdings will in any event be mandatorily acquired.  And assuming that such level of acceptances will be received, there is no reason for not accepting the Offer).

Please would you let me know whether you wish to accept the Offer.  Ideally, if we are to do so, I would plan to send the acceptance by close of business on Friday 25 May.


Thanks
Justin

Also on Wednesday, Kym says she'll have more on the California Senate Energy Committee's hearing on the Independent Systems Operators' Market Design Plan for 2002. Members of the committee say they have serious doubts about the ISO's ability to enforce market rules going forward. 

We'll also talk with Hydrogenics President and CEO Pierre Rivard on Wednesday. Rivard will join us from the NASDAQ during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast to discuss hydrogen fuel cell technology.

 	  	 Dear Andrew,

On Monday, the Washington bureau will follow up on the President's new push for energy legislation in Congress. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says on Friday, we heard some of the President's strongest language to date, urging Democrats in the Senate to bring a bill to the floor. 

There are also several energy hearings scheduled in Congress next week, including one on possible new limits on power plant emissions in the Senate and another on MTBE in the House. The hearings are some of the first to be rescheduled since the anthrax scare hit Congress earlier this month. 

RDI Consulting Principal Mark Morey is penciled in from the Washington bureau on Monday. He'll share his insight on where the emissions issue stands on the Hill during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast. 

Secretary of Interior Gale Norton was in Houston Friday at the IPAA conference. On Monday Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us more from Secretary Norton on Lease Sale 181 and how drilling in ANWR will create thousands of jobs for Texans. 

Noble Drilling CEO Jim Day will also stop by the Houston bureau to talk about his company's third-quarter earnings. The company reported very good earnings but Day warns that the fourth quarter may not be as good because of a weakening economy. Join us for all the details on Monday. 

ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Western States Petroleum Association Spokesperson Dave Fogarty next week. Fogarty will discuss California's decision to ban MTBE by December 31, 2002 and whether the state is ready for this move. Catch Fogarty from the West Coast bureau on Wednesday. 

Former Governor Pete Wilson tells Kym he takes responsibility for signing the state's deregulation plan, but adds there were steps Governor Gray Davis could and should have taken to avoid what turned out to be an energy crisis. Kym will have all the details on this story next week. 

Finally from New York, Goldman Sachs Analyst Dave Fleischer will drop by to talk about the gas market during the noon ET newscast. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a fantastic weekend! 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

Subject:	RE: EnronOnline in the palm of your hand

Hi Greg,

The ETS guys currently listen to our TIB traffic and use it in some of their internal applications.  This is a practice that I have never liked, primarily because these messages are intended to be internal to the EOL application suite, and we need the flexibility to change them as necessary.  As an example, as part of a recent exercise to reduce the overall network traffic, we re-engineered the entire EOL messaging layer.  However, it took us months to roll that change to production because we had to wait for the many pirates of our data to change to the new message structure. 

Our message to these guys has always been that we cannot support these efforts, and that we maintain the freedom to change our messaging at any time.  In practice, however, that is not realistic.  The ""EnronOnline in the palm of your hand"" e-mail refers to an application service that ETS has built on top of our message traffic that allows IPAQ users to request EOL prices.  This is particularly problematic, because as Andy as said, we must maintain control of the EnronOnline brand.  We don't have any control of the quality of this application.  The idea is a good one, so it is likely that if it is made available, our traders will be using it.  Or worse, our executives.  At that point, we have no choice but to fully support it.  As such, this kind of thing circumvents our prioritization process.  

Andy's message to Steve (below) is very gracious.  Frankly, I believe the message should simply be ""kill this"".

Steve,

I understand that you are rolling this product out for internal users only. In that case I have a couple of thoughts

1). I have no problem with an internal launch of this. If external, I have a very big problem.

2). I think it would be better for the relationship between ETS and ENW had you informed us of your intention to do this. You are using the EnronOnline brand and whether that is internal or external it is ours to manage. as this was a complete surprise to us. It doesn't really seem like just a pipeline risk management product.

3). Because this was not part of our development and operations effort, we cannot support the product technically. There will be no change management. Given the amount of changes we do to our back end there is a high likelihood that in the future your product will cease to function

4). It looks pretty good and I commend your ingenuity. 

If you disagree with any of this please feel free to let me know.

Andy Zipper

The Scoop	
  <http://www.money.net/40images/clear.gif>
	
A very volatile morning with the market and particularly the tech dominated Nasdaq generally on the defensive into midday.  The market got little mileage out of the surprising strength in the early Q4 Advance GDP report despite the fact that the number (+0.2%) was well above the consensus estimate of -1.1%.  Much of the unexpected strength was the result of heavy government spending and gains in durable orders (auto financing deals) and this may have kept investors from becoming overly enthusiastic about the data.  Also continuing to cast a pall over the market, at least in the morning, were accounting worries.  Speculation/reports that additional...

Thanks for the feedback.  Useful to know what the Journalists are using EnronOnline for.

Will go ahead and extend Reuters' guest access for a further 2 months.

Subject:	EnronOnline Guest Access - media feedback

Following on from the Dow Jones request, I have now had a request from Reuters to extend their guest access.  Please could you let me know if this is possible?

In the meantime, to give an indication of the value of the media guest access programme, I have spoken to both Reuters and Dow Jones to get a feel for how they are using the prices.

According to Dow Jones, the reporters access EnronOnline regularly during the day to check where the prices are and if they see, for example, any sharp movements, they will follow up with a call to a trader.  They are conscious that traders like them to be aware of what is happening in the market when they call, so they feel that this is proving to be an 'invaluable' tool.  In terms of using Enron's prices in their articles, the reporters do use EnronOnline's prices when preparing their market commentary as they have been told by brokers that Enron's prices are pretty reliable (aware that EnronOnline is not an exchange, they will normally confirm the prices with other parties).

The Reuters reporters look at the prices on an almost daily basis and use some of the prices in reporting.  In their view, it helps them not to keep calling the traders constantly, as well as helping them to keep track of the market.  They say that they are 'addicted' to the guest access.

Bruce:

I work with Andy Zipper as an originator for EnronOnline.  Andy has tasked me to focus on developing EOL origination opportunities in the metals and mining sectors (base and precious), and he asked me to contact you to move this process along.  Would you have a moment during the next few days to conference via telephone on this topic?

Andy's group is working to develop new revenue opportunities for the EnronOnline platform; our two key products are described below.  Andy said that several companies in the copper and aluminum sector (among others) have approached you in recent months seeking these types of trading and/or product management capabilities.  I would like to follow up with these prospects with your help.

I would be pleased to discuss the offering in greater detail via telephone.  What time works for you during the next several days?

Best regards,

Mike

EnronOnline Products:

1). EnronOnline product hosting via remote stack manager. Customers can display products on www.enrononline.com and control them with the stack manager. Transactions will be between company offering product and customer; Enron does not stand in middle for credit. We are a marketplace operator.

2). X-online hosted environment. Enron Networks hosted instances of the EnronOnline product. This is private-label hosted software. If counterparty is interested in non-ENW hosting, that can be considered, but is problematic from a support and maintenance standpoint.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Andrew,  I'm Washington Correspondent Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts while he's on vacation this week.   On Monday, International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale brought us reports previewing the 115th OPEC Conference from Vienna, Austria.  On Tuesday, the OPEC Conference gets underway with Wolfgang bringing us live reports from the conference throughout the day.  Wolfgang says on Wednesday he's scheduled to have an interview with OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez.  Don't miss the Rodriguez interview or Wolfgang's live reports from Vienna on Tuesday and Wednesday.   We're going to be busy in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday.  For starters, President Bush is scheduled to meet with heads of several national environmental groups at the White House.  We'll bring you an update on their meeting Tuesday.   However, the biggest news from Washington is the change of power taking place in the Senate.  Tuesday evening Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords is expected to officially leave the Republican Party, thereby giving Democrats control of the Senate for the first time since 1994.  The change in power is a huge blow to the Republicans' chances of passing the Bush administration's national energy policy.  We'll have more on these developments on Tuesday.     From our Houston bureau, ENL's Gale Smith reports she'll bring us a package on a minority-owned energy business on Tuesday.   The Houston-based company refurbishes pipelines and flow-measurement equipment, and employs mostly minorities.  Correspondent Kim Benestante says the Houston bureau will also bring us a report on the Valero Corporation.  Valero executed lease agreements with purchase options for a 115,000 barrel per day refinery currently owned by El Paso in Corpus Christi, Texas.  The Houston bureau is scheduled to bring us all the details on these stories and more on Tuesday.   Also from our Houston bureau, Omega Oil Company's Andy Ashby is scheduled to join us.  He'll discuss below the reservoir production methods, coal bed methane production and domestic oil and gas production.  We'll speak with Ashby in the 12:00 p.m. ET newscast on Tuesday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

"RE: Conagra is our newest beta customer!","
Nice work!  It's particularly exciting because they are not just interested in energy.

Subject: Conagra is our newest beta customer! 
Last week, our sales team signed Conagra Foods, a Fortune 100 company, to a 
beta license for the Risk Workbench.  Based in Omaha, ConAgra is North 
America's largest foodservice supplier and the nation's second largest name 
in retail foods (www.conagra.com).  In 2000, Conagra had revenues of over 
$25 billion, making it 68th on the Fortune 1000 list.  Many of their 
consumer brands are household names: Hunt's tomato products, Healthy Choice, 
Louis Kemp, Libby's, Wesson, Country Pride, Blue Bonnet, Parkay, Reddi-wip, 
Marie Callender's, Butterball, Chef Boyardee, Orville Redenbacher's, Peter 
Pan, and Swiss Miss.  
They currently have a large risk management and trading operation in Omaha 
that hedges their exposure to energy and agricultural prices while engaging 
in some speculative trading.  Kiodex will work directly with the principals 
in this division as well as senior management as they adopt the Risk 
Workbench for the purpose of conducting this mission critical function.  
Conagra represents a tremendous opportunity for Kiodex to enroll a Fortune 
100 company in becoming a high-profile reference account for us as we launch 
on August 23rd.  Our focus, beginning on July 9th, will be on converting 
this trophy client into a full paying customer (they are paying to 
participate in the beta program) of the Risk Workbench.  I ask all of you to 
help us realize this opportunity. 
I would like to especially acknowledge Russ Chalom in our sales department 
for his work on this account.  For the past 2 months, he has been 
aggressively courting Conagra, performing demonstrations for senior 
management, including the CEO.  His lucid delivery and cogent explanation of 
the Risk Workbench value proposition created this opportunity for all of us. 
Well done, Russ!

Raj

"EOL Team Connection to Operations","I left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you to call - am sure that it is a busy Monday.  I will send this note so that I don't forget the purpose.  With Savita assuming the role previously played by Sheri with regard to the Product Control group, I wanted to underscore the importance of a free flow of information between the EOL team and my operations team.  One of the roles that Sheri's team fulfilled was keeping my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within EOL that can have an impact on bridging to our legacy systems.  I may have met Savita once in passing.  I checked with Jeff Gossett and Stacey White, risk leads over gas and power, respectively, and neither one has heard of or met Savita.  Although Jennifer Denney will play an active role, I know that she will be out on maternity leave soon, so it is important for Savita to know the right players on the operations team and for them to know her.  I will contact Savita directly to make the appropriate introductions.  I just wanted your support and encouragement for Savita in making the right connections within operations.  --Sally

The Scoop	
  <http://www.money.net/40images/clear.gif>
	
Today's market action was as exciting as the Superbowl. OK maybe that's overstating it. However, it was a very interesting day. The market whipsawed all day long before finally closing slightly lower. The big news in the pre-market was Ciena (CIEN 9.00 -1.12) warning by a pretty wide margin which hurt the networkers all day long. Also, a weak earning report from Sprint PCS (PCS 10.99 -2.77) weighed heavily on the wireless space as many names made new 52-wk lows: NXTL -26%, TPC -12%, WWCA -9%. The Nasdaq set a low not seen since Nov 12..Despite the bad news, the market soon moved higher, then lower on poor job data, then higher again. The market was making a strong run in afternoon trading,...

"Lord Vader,","Your minion request an answer to a question.

Hi Andy,

Despite the dot com melt down, and California setting back energy
deregulation, we at gromco are still alive. I was encouraged by Eugene
Lockhart's comments last month that New Power spends on average $140 to
acquire a residential electric or nat gas customer. You can, I'm sure,
see where this is going. We would be delighted to bring customers to New
Power for substantially less, and I think we are in a good position to
do so. Requests for alternative energy suppliers has dramatically
increased in the last 6 months, unfortunately alternatives have not,
since many suppliers have left the market.

At your leisure, could you find out who I should talk to at New Power
about customer acquisitions? I know that they are a separate company,
but hopefully you have some interaction with them.

Thanks in advance for your help, thoughts and opinions.

I know you are doing well professionally and hopefully also personally.
I, Senor Blas Pina, am getting married on December 1, 2001. Hard to
believe, but very good and exciting. I still live in Houston, but am
plotting my return to Boston, or at least the Northeast. I still keep up
with almost all the members of the former Coral risk management group.
Sunny left for Williams last week, on not so good of a note, so they are
looking for a new option trader.

Best regards and take care.

Jorg

"RE: InternetWeek 100","1000 transactions a day in metals is almost true.  Too bad steel is not a metal and we do zero trades a day in that.  We also do not live and die by the bid offer spread.  We make literally no money on that spread.  That is purely there to manage making the market.  The money is in other things that we probably don't want to get in to with a publication.  I liked the very last sentance.  It was the ""have your cake and eat it too.""

Other than that, it was OK.

What are your thoughts?

"Unocal, Tesoro, Pioneer, Equiva, Reliant to Provide Opening-Day Insights at IE2001","Headline:  ""Unocal, Tesoro, Pioneer, Equiva, Reliant Among Energy Companies
Providing Opening-Day Insights at Interactive Energy 2001""

HOUSTON, TEXAS, November 19, 2001 - The opening-day program for Interactive
Energy has been set with presentations from SAP, Booz Allen Hamilton and
case studies and panel discussions from management from such companies as
Reliant, Equiva, Tesoro, Unocal and SAIC.  

Les Amidei, VP of business development for process from SAP America, will
open the session to discuss how energy companies are working to gain maximum
returns from their current investments.  Many of the larger companies
committed to SAP's enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems during the
past 15 years, and new innovations must interface with SAP to access and
uplink enterprise data.

""With all the great promises of the internet, the energy industry has made
numerous investments in information technology,"" notes Amidei.  ""The reality
is that while many have delivered, many [others] have not. As a result, the
overall climate has changed dramatically where any investment in technology
will be driven by measurable and quantifiable ROI. Leveraging existing
investments such as ERP into new arenas will be critical in assuring maximum
value is delivered.""""

A panel of senior technology officers, including Xavier Flinois, president,
Schlumberger Network Solutions; Tom Halbouty, CIO, Pioneer Natural
Resources; Paul Cuneo, CIO, Equiva Services LLP; and Ray Cline, CTO, SAIC,
will follow Amidei's presentation.  Each panelist will be asked how he or
she is prioritizing IT spending and levering from investments made in
previous years to maximize profitability. Accenture Partner Jeff Sakaguchi
will direct the discussion.  Then, Eduardo Alvarez, partner of Booz Allen
Hamilton will wrap up the morning with a presentation on how some energy
companies have managed innovation more effectively and what can be learned
from their strategies.  

In the afternoon, the conference will feature the results of an IT survey
conducted by Booz Allen Hamilton and Zeus Development Corporation, which
investigates how the upstream, refining and gas and power sectors are
prioritizing IT spending. The two firms have joined in the research project
to interview information officers at many of the world's leading energy
firms to understand how they are currently managing IT investment.  The
report will enhance and build upon the earlier presentations, providing a
broader industry perspective. 

Then, four case studies will be presented: The first entitled, ""Dropping the
'E:' Moving E-Business to Just Business"" by
Tim Pownell, general manager, e-procurement project, will discuss how 
Unocal is in the process of fully integrating their e-business systems into
the mainstream practices of the company. 

The second, entitled ""Rapid ERP Integration: A New Supervisory Application
to Reduce Training Time and Improve Inventory Accuracy,"" which will be
presented by Mark Evans, CIO, Tesoro, will discuss how Tesoro was able to
integrate its marine logistics unit into the broader SAP ERP to improve
performance, inventory accuracy and employee satisfaction. 

The third and fourth presentations will be made by management from Reliant
Resources Inc. to describe how they are using IT to prepare for Texas'
forthcoming deregulated marketplace.  Will Symmes, director - energy
information systems, will describe how Reliant has developed an
internet-based energy information and analysis portal for large industrial
customers, entitled ""Energy Commander.""  Then, Ron Orsini, vice president -
eBusiness, will discuss how Reliant is investigating home automation
technology to better serve residential and small business accounts. 

""We're very pleased with the lineup for Wednesday and believe it provides a
most important full-day forum for the opening discussion of Interactive
Energy,"" said Nimocks. ""In the final analysis, our job is to facilitate the
exchange of information and ideas so advancements can be made more
efficiently, and this lineup promises to do that.""

  <http://www.money.net/40images/clear.gif>
	
After a pretty uneventful morning session, the market perked up in the afternoon, led by the strength in the blue chip components and a welcome rebound in the tech sector... Strikingly, the indices staged another late rally that left them at, or near, their best levels of the day...

"","LaGrasta wants to be able to generate a position report for his customers that shows all their trades, EOL or otherwise, on a MTM basis between ENE and them.

Does Kiodex do this?  He is meeting Kiodex today.

Is this a Sally issue or EOL issue?

Let's discuss.  It all is coming to getting your position or statement with Enron electronically.  Like STP, it sounds like it would help the clients.

<p><b>Congress is out of town</b>, but we've still got plenty of energy
news from Washington.  The <b>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
meets</b> on Tuesday.  One of the issues on the FERC's agenda is a
<b>complaint filed against the California Independent System
Operator</b>.  Some companies allege the ISO is giving the California
Department of Water Resources preferential market treatment in its new
role as California's main power purchaser.  We'll bring you the latest
from the FERC on Tuesday. 
<p>ENL's Washington bureau will also cover the <b>release of the North

<b>Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology Conference</b> in
Washington.  The event focuses on the <b>latest in clean coal
innovation</b> and the prospects for coal-fired generation in the U.S.
<p>Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante reports, many companies feel
<b>wild price swings could be eliminated with more accurate weather
predictions</b>.  On Tuesday, Kim talks with <b>Reliant Energy</b> about
steps that can be taken to minimize weather risks.
<p><b>Ivanhoe Energy Vice President of Investor Relations John
MacDonald</b> talks with our Houston bureau about plans his company has
for <b>Gas-to-Liquids production</b>.  This type of motor fuel is
odorless and emissions-free.  We'll have more from MacDonald on Tuesday.

<p>From the NASDAQ on Tuesday, <b>ESAI Power and Gas Services Director
Edward Kraples</b> will join us.  During the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast,
he'll talk about the amount of <b>investment needed to keep Northwest
power prices from escalating</b>.
<p>Broadcasting Note: Thanksgiving is this Thursday and the ENL staff is
preparing the turkey.  The markets are <b>closed Thursday and Friday, so
we'll be dark</b>.  
<p>Wrap Note: In response to many viewer requests, starting today we're
going to <b>add some of the day's commodity settles</b>.  We hope you'll
enjoy this new addition to the daily wrap.

"Good news about the Financial Times and Dow Jones Interactive","Dear Subscriber:


In our continuous commitment to enhance the services we offer
you, Factiva is proud to announce the expanded availability of
the Financial Times (FT).

Commencing June 16, the full text from all editions of the FT,
including FT.com, will be accessible to all Publications Library
and CustomClips customers.  The FT will continue to be
unavailable in Business Newsstand. The rollout of the full text of
the FT complements Factiva's compelling content set of top must-read
global business sources including The Wall Street Journal and
Dow Jones, Reuters and AP Newswires. In addition, this unique
source combination will be offered at launch in Factiva.com, our
new flagship product.

The full text will replace the FT Abstracts. In order to provide
you with uninterrupted coverage, the full text of all articles
from June 1 on will be made available. The FT abstract archive
to date will continue to be accessible to you as well.

This change will require no action on your part. The full text of
the FT will have the same source codes that were previously applied
to the FT Abstracts. This means your CustomClips folders and saved
searches will automatically get this expanded content - and it will
be available on day of publication to provide you with the most
up-to-date global business information.

If you have any questions, please contact your account executive.

Regards,

Greg Gerdy
Vice President and Director, Product Management
Factiva, a Dow Jones & Reuters Company

"RE: DRAFT PRESS RELEASE: Truequote.com Posts EnronOnline Prices On its System","My usual questions.

Are we doing this because we have to legally or that we want to or that TrueQuote wants to?

If we do one, what is the objective?  

Your thoughts on this?

Subject:	DRAFT PRESS RELEASE: Truequote.com Posts EnronOnline Prices On its System

Attached is a draft press release regarding the deal between EnronOnline and TrueQuote.  This is a follow-up to last year's announcement.  The system is being tested today.  If the testing goes as planned, they expect to release this when the system goes live next week, which could be as early as Monday, June 4.

"RE: Enron Concerns about JavaSoft","I've edited some of the text to more succinctly get at the important points.

  --jay

Scott,

Enron appreciates the time Sun has devoted to us over the recent weeks.  We have enjoyed meeting with your personnel and yourself to share with you some of Enron's needs and concerns.

EnronOnline and Enron E-Commerce are required to deliver a unique set of capabilities.  Our application and organization must support the high velocity (soft real-time) trading behavior of a commodities market, the ever increasing number and complexity of business requirements, the increasing degree of integration between Enron and its trading partners, and the need to do all this as quickly as possible without sacrificing software quality.  

We embrace the notion of standards-based development.  It holds the promise to allow us to focus development resources on delivering business functionality and not on developing middleware and containers or dealing with enterprise integration.  However, due to what we believe to be inherent deficiencies in the J2EE specification, we have gradually reduced our use of these technologies.  In fact, EnronOnline's most critical systems were developed outside of J2EE.  

The problem areas are performance and enterprise integration.  Specifically, the specification does not allow for sufficient tuning.  The result is that many of the ""features"" cause significant performance penalties, even when those features are not relevant to the application at hand.  Additionally, as B2B markets evolve, there is a greater need for integration between multiple platforms.  This need is not addressed at all.

It is our perception that the J2EE specification is influenced too heavily by vendor input.  We believe that large end-user customers should have an equal voice in the evolution of the specification.  Such input would be particularly valuable since vendor competition issues would not taint it.  We would welcome an opportunity to participate in such a committee.

Scott McNealy at Sun asked us to send in an e-mail to him our issues with JavaSoft.  Mike took a shot at it and a draft is below.  It has not gone to him yet but we should get him something soon.

My comments are that the draft below is very accurate but is too long and detailed for a CEO and the last paragraph, thought factual, will change.

Can you please give me your comments so I can get back with Mike and Jay and finish something and send it to Scott?

Scott,

Enron appreciates the time Sun has devoted to us over the recent weeks.  We have enjoyed meeting with your personnel and yourself to share with you some of Enron's needs and concerns.

EnronOnline and Enron E-Commerce are required to deliver a unique set of capabilities.  Our application and organization must support the high velocity (soft real-time) trading behavior of a commodities market, the ever increasing number and complexity of business requirements, the increasing degree of integration between Enron and its trading partners, and the need to do all this as quickly as possible without sacrificing software quality.  Each item in itself is not unique, but the combination is.

We firmly believe that our only hope for success is to base our application upon a solid technology stack and development methodology.  Our view of the technology stack starts at the bottom with networking, server hardware and storage, operating systems, language, language-level specifications, tools, APIs, and containers, language-independent middleware, and enterprise-level specifications and APIs.  Through out this stack, we need the ability to tune each level to optimize it for the particular effort at hand.  For instance, applications which do not sustain significant load may wish to take advantage of feature rich language-level and enterprise-level APIs; these applications can live with the performance overhead of these APIs.  On the other hand, some applications, such as soft-real-time delivery of quotes over the internet, require the highest performance possible and we are willing to sacrifice the convenience of more feature rich and slower APIs.

As an application development manager, I embrace the notion of standards-based development.  It holds the promise to allow me to focus my development resources on delivering business functionality and not on developing middleware and containers or dealing with enterprise integration.  Unfortunately, there are significant deficiencies in the existing set of specifications from JavaSoft, W3C, OMG, and IBM/Microsoft.  None of the specs or APIs have any concept of performance.  None of the specs or APIs allow for tunability of features to increase performance.  Lastly, there is a significant gulf between language-level and enterprise-level specifications.  For instance, the J2EE technology suite does not at all address enterprise-level integration.  To be fair, IBM/Microsoft Web Services does not at all address language-level development.  

The fact of the matter is that because of all these deficiencies I have had to continually reduce my use of J2EE technologies.  In fact, Enron's most critical systems were developed outside of J2EE.  Only our least critical systems use J2EE.  In addition, my group spends at least 40% of its development time addressing enterprise-level integration.  As the biggest B-to-B site in the world, one can imagine the level of integration we are expected to provide.

My primary criticism with Sun is that they approach customers from the bottom of the technology stack working your way up.  Customers need someone to start at the top of the technology stack and explain why it then leads to the bottom.  For Sun, it appears to be all about selling hardware and operating systems.  Enron has moved past those times.  We need top-down solutions.

Solutions:
Create a separate, distinct, and equally influential body in JavaSoft including ONLY large end-user customers (Power Users).  A good first list would include Enron, Charles Schwab, GE, and E-Bay.
Create an initiative to focus on enterprise-level specifications with input primarily from the Power Users.  This should not be influenced by vendors.
Ensure all past and future Java specifications and APIs are geared around tunability and performance.
Rethink EJBs.

If you want to stop Microsoft from conquering the world, you have to do more than shouting to the heavens.  Perhaps, you concede the B-to-C, C-to-C, and E-to-E (employee to employer) markets for now.  There's some money there but not as much as there is in the B-to-B market.  (Besides, if you really want to win in those markets you need to come out with a desktop which has some useful software on it.)  My recommendation is to end-run Microsoft in the B-to-B market by coming out with enterprise-level specification which work and ensure that the Java-based implementation of those specifications are the best.  Then market share will follow.

"Wharton","Guys--

First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! (details please, at your earliest chance)

Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums (coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton.

 The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level.  
Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.

Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and corporate executives.

O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??

As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, references, course work, etc. 

A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an ""Enron brain drain"" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron).   

The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the 
financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion.

ALL comments solicited----

Many thanks!!

--Christie.

Christie,

Lee Goldring, our new Forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you
to introduce himself and follow up on Enron's representation at the next
meeting.  I'm emailing this information to you to alert you to the situation
since I do not think you would want Enron to go unrepresented at the next
meeting. To date, no one from Enron has registered for the Forum sponsored
Online Conversion Workshop,  the Forum meeting on 5/31 or the Members Only
meeting on 6/1.  Please note that the ""From Browsers to Buyers: Online
Conversion Workshop"" on May 30th is purely optional in case some folks from
Enron are interested in attending.  Since the Forum is co-sponsoring the
Workshop -- WeBI affiliated registrants will not be charged the $495
registration fee as an added benefit for their sponsorship.

Here are all the relevent links to the Forum agenda and registration sites

Subject:	Recommended Offer by ICE for IPE Holdings

This is to point out to you the approaching deadline for accepting ICE's Offer for IPE Holdings.  If we wish to accept this Offer, we must do so no later than 3 pm on Tuesday 29 May.

In the meantime, Michael has received calls from Richard Ward (IPE's CEO) inquiring as to our position, and it would be my view that we should accept the Offer. (Note that if ICE receives acceptances of 90% or more, then our shares in IPE Holdings will in any event be mandatorily acquired.  And assuming that such level of acceptances will be received, there is no reason for not accepting the Offer).

Please would you let me know whether you wish to accept the Offer.  Ideally, if we are to do so, I would plan to send the acceptance by close of business on Friday 25 May.


Thanks
Justin

I am not paying for either conference.  It is rather a larger concentration of companies and I felt a more efficient way to access the market opportunity for our products in pulp & paper & lumber.  The alternative is to fly around the country to visit them individually.  These 2 conferences hapnned to be back to back and have a decent roster of companies attending.

We have struck common commercial ground with Bloomberg after all these months, however, there is still a technical obstacle.  This meeting's objective is to introduce our QDF and let them know what they have to build to.

Due to resource constraints this is not a deal we would consider until later in the year IF it requires additional development.  For now, your assistance in ""selling"" the QDF architecture would be valuable.

"Value Proposition for Enron from TechSpan","
Hi Andy

Hope you have had a chance to review our earlier details and hopefully it
would have given you further insights into our capabilities.

During the recent Board meeting with Goldman Sachs, our Enron strategy was
discussed and we indicated our correspondance with you. All of us are very
exited and working on ways of initiating the process. Moreover, due to the
strategic nature of partnership, our Management has also decided to invest
in developing this association.

I would discuss the proposition (from our Senior Management) during a
telecon and you could assess the feasibility.

Meanwhile, some areas that we are currently working with Goldman Sachs,
Nortel, Chevron, HP, etc are indicated below and we could replicate the same
with Enron:


1.	Module Development or enhancements to existing applications
      - Portal
      - Adaptor/Connector Development
      - Integrating online trading apps with Back End systems
      - Ariba customization/enhancements
      - Content Management
      - e-Procurement &  EBPP
      - other application specific integration

2.	Maintenance & enhancements (Could be done in India for cost saving
and round the clock operations)
3.	Re-engineering, Migration and porting for your existing applications

4.	QA

Andy, we are confident that this proposition of ours would be very
attractive and would go a long way in developing a strong association.

Could we discuss our business proposition this week ? I could call your
admin assistant tommorow (6/5) and fix up a suitable time for the call (10 -
15 Minutes Max.) We could follow this up with a technical meeting to
identify specific areas, should you feel comfortable with our proposition.

Looking forward to our discussions.

Thks, Arvind

Dear Andy

Thanks for your Mail. I sincerely hope you were able to get a high level
overview of our company. Further to my earlier mail, i am enclosing the
information which could provide further insight into our company. Pls
include them in your assessment process and give me a feedback if you
require any further clarification. We look forward to meeting you and your
team for an  presentation and the value we could bring to Enron. In the
presentation, we would cover our Methodology, Processes, Competencies,
Clients , Case Study & our economical/cost effective deployment processes.

Some synergies i perceive; Enron's initiative in ClickPaper could map well
based on our experience in Forest Express , EnronOnline could map into our
experience with RMX/Chevron or American Petroleum Exchange, Dealbench.com
maps well with our experience with eBreviate on the hosted ASP model for
eRFP,Auctions,Supplier Search. Moreoever, our development labs in India
could add great value for your module development, ongoing support,
maintenance, QA, Porting work; deploying a very low cost structure.

1.	TechSpan Details: I have enclosed the following -

	1.1 Company Overview (Management, Revenues, Growth, Locations,
Services, Competencies,  etc)
	1.2 TechSpan B2B Markets Expertise Brochure
	1.3 Case Study - e2Open , Traiana
	1.4 Projects with Ariba & MOAI

2.	Other Details which could be of interest

	2.1 TechSpan has been featured on IDC's analysis (Report No. 23918)

	"" IDC believes that TechSpan has done a good job of melding its
evolution as a services business to that of its 	partnerhips""

	2.2.  BEA's Partner brochure on its competency (attachment), wherein
TechSpan has been evaluated at par with KPMG & 	CSC. All our clients have
also realized the value in TechSpan and all have positioned us equivalent
(and higher in many 	cases)to any Big 5 Consulting firm.

	2.3.  INDIAN E-BIZ CONSULTING MARKET WORTH $136 M.: V&D

	TechSpan tops the Big Six list of e-biz consultants in India with
total business worth $67 million, followed by 	Planetasia and MindTree. The
study has identified pricing as the one big advantage enjoyed by Indian pure

In summary, we are a young company (two years in operations) with high
ambitions and clearly articulated vision of being a leader in the e-commerce
consulting space. We have achieved major milestones in being a $ 67.0
Million company within 2 years, largely due to the confidence exhibited by
our customers and partners. Though the above are some achievements in the
past (giving you a base comfort factor on our long term stability), we are
keen in discussing what value we could bring to Enron, now and in the
future.

Let me know when the contract comes in for the API, how it looks and what the voyeur charge is.

Get us on whatever panel they come up with on mid/back office.  Who should sit on this panel?

Subject:	ICE

I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading.

1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it.

2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.

3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role.

4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services. I told him we would.

If anyone has any questions about this let me know.

"RE: Duke and OpenLink","Thanks.  We had looked at OpenLink/Abacus last year, and we concluded that they were heavily risk control/management weighted.  We are concerned that they may try to ""swim downstream."" They are relatively small (about 100).  We will try to keep an eye on them...

OpenLink is one of the leaders in risk management systems. We used at Coral, and it was then called Abacus. It is strongest in front office risk management. I would view their competition as KioDex. The deal with Duke has been around for awhile.

The Scoop	
  <http://www.money.net/40images/clear.gif>
	
It was another confounding day of trading on Wall Street as the market rallied in the face of bad news-- a bunch of bad news... For starters, the ECB maintained its obstinate stance of fighting inflation and elected, once again, not to lower interest rates... Shortly after that news hit the wires, it was reported that durable orders for the month of September plunged 8.5%, which was well below the consensus estimate of a 1.0% decline...  In the midst of those disappointing developments, there were a number of negative research calls and a slew of lackluster earnings results... At 10 ET, the market learned that existing home sales dropped 11.7% in Sept. to 4.89 mln-- the weakest pace since...

Any luck on letter of credit?  Is there anything we can help with on our side?  We are very keen to close this transaction in the next two weeks if possible.  

Call me at 713 853-0397 if you have any questions.  I will call you tomorrow to touch base.  Mark can handle any legal issues.

Thanks

Thanks for your mail

Mr. Goldsmith -

I have attached below a copy of the updated BETA reflecting the changes you
proposed earlier. I have added some language to your proposals, but have
kept the intention intact.

The only additional comments that I will make are that Enron will require
(a) a confirmatory letter from Natsource LLC that the LC posted by
Natsource will be applicable to Natsource-Tullet (in essence a guarantee
letter) and (b)  if an LC has already been posted, it will need to be
modified so that it will reflect the ability of Enron to realize under it
for Natsource-Tullet.  If no LC has been issued, this latter point will
need to be handled in any LC issued.

Please take a look at the attached and let me know if anything further.  I
will be checking with our personnel to confirm that Natsource LLC does not
have to be a signatory to this BETA.

"Metals contacts","Bruce:

I work with Andy Zipper as an originator for EnronOnline.  Andy has tasked me to focus on developing EOL origination opportunities in the metals and mining sectors (base and precious), and he asked me to contact you to move this process along.  Would you have a moment during the next few days to conference via telephone on this topic?

Andy's group is working to develop new revenue opportunities for the EnronOnline platform; our two key products are described below.  Andy said that several companies in the copper and aluminum sector (among others) have approached you in recent months seeking these types of trading and/or product management capabilities.  I would like to follow up with these prospects with your help.

I would be pleased to discuss the offering in greater detail via telephone.  What time works for you during the next several days?

Best regards,

Mike

EnronOnline Products:

1). EnronOnline product hosting via remote stack manager. Customers can display products on www.enrononline.com and control them with the stack manager. Transactions will be between company offering product and customer; Enron does not stand in middle for credit. We are a marketplace operator.

2). X-online hosted environment. Enron Networks hosted instances of the EnronOnline product. This is private-label hosted software. If counterparty is interested in non-ENW hosting, that can be considered, but is problematic from a support and maintenance standpoint.

Attached is a proposed test plan from HoustonStreet for tomorrow.  I have reserved conference room 2712 beginning at 2:30 tomorrow and will escort HoustonStreet onto our floor at 2:30 tomorrow.  They will be allowed to set up machines from 2:30 to 3:00.  At 3:00 we will allow HoustonStreet to discuss their plan prior to our review.

Enron has terminated the price posting agreement and has no obligation to do testing.  We have simply agreed to review their system. 

During the review  anyone working with HoustonStreet should refrain from making any comments (positive or negative) concerning the performance of the system.  We will simply take the review under advisement.  

All discussions with HoustonStreet should be handled by myself or Savita.  

If you have any questions call me on 30397.

Bob,
I'll give you a call in the AM to see about lunch.

We would like to get started between 2-2:30 setting up the machines that we
will be using during the demonstration.  This should take approximately 1/2
hour to download the correct .CAB files and ensure that the application
installs correctly.  We will need to have administrative rights on these
machines in order to facilitate the installation.

At 3:00 if we could start in a conference room for approximately 15 minutes
we can review the demonstration scenarios and our objectives.
From 3:20 - 3:40 we will run through the demo scenario 1.
From 3:40 - 4:00 we will run through the demo scenario 2.
From 4:00 - 4:45 will be a free form testing time.
From 4:45 - 5:00 wrap-up, review, Q&A.

I'm getting ready to head to the airport - If you have any questions etc,
don't hesitate to give me a call on my cell phone - 603-591-9004.  Thanks,

Not clear to me if this is strictly Accenture's work for Credit or for EOL.  Not sure if they've worked for us, but I presume we don't want them taking ANY credit for our success given our origination goals and messages!

We know Vijay quite well and he is not easiest to deal with.  He has believed for years that Shell was going to take us over and never cured from that obsession.  I don't know anything about Vijay's visit, so don't know who he's speaking to in the US.  If he needs to be briefed on Enron Credit, I think that should be done by John here from London. 

And the decision to let Accenture talk about their work with Enron is one that has to be taken from corporate hq (Meredith). I would imagine though that our own Enron story is enough of a story, we don't need to do or like any 3rd-party endorsement from Accenture.

Accenture has done some work for us defining the 21st century credit process to support the online business environment.....not sure if they would add value here but we certainly would like Enron Credit discussed in the article if possible....

Greetings,

I will try to clarify what I know re: the ECONOMIST's interest in Enron,
and possibly speaking with someone at Accenture:

- Vijay Vaitheeswaran, reporter for the ECONOMIST, will be visiting Houston
next Monday-Wednesday; he leaves London this weekend for the States.

- he is doing 'an indepth' story on Enron, particularly interested in their
eBusiness operations;  he has been told that Accenture has worked on
different programs at/for Enron in general (NO MENTION OF SPECIFIC
PROJECTS!!!), that we are trying to ID what might be appropriate for the
reporter's needs .... and that we need more specific details from Vijay, to
nail down the right partner.

- Vijay has said only that he'd like to talk to someone who has worked on
Accenture's eBusiness work for Enron, to find out how Accenture has helped
Enron to maximize those ebusiness capabilities.

- would also like to discuss Accenture work around eBusiness in general

NOW, given sensitivities of the nondisclosure agreements around some of the
projects Accenture is currently working on w/Enron:

     1.  IS there anything that Accenture can tell this reporter about
eBusiness, without endangering the Enron relationship?  What would the
topics be?

     2. IF WE decide to participate, who would be the best Accenture
partner to be interviewed?  Peggy?  Kenny?  Jeff S.?

     3.  DOES ENRON approve of our speaking with the ECONOMIST?  (certainly
if they are talking with him, this could be an opportunity for us to
support, echo and otherwise fortify Enron's message points in this area - -
I look to Kenny and Peggy for guidance here).

Messages have been left with Vijay, asking for more specific information.
I will follow up with him as directly as I can on Monday;  since Vijay with
be in the US, he should now deal with me and/or Neil Nowlin, my media
relations colleague based in the Dallas office of BursonMarsteller
(Accenture's PR counsel).

I've attached some background info on Vijay (see below);

I look forward to your thoughts and comments.

Cheers

BACKGROUND BIO INFO ON Vijay Vaitheeswaran:

Vijay Vaitheeswaran
The Economist

Vijay Vaitheeswaran covers oil for The Economist magazine in London.  He
earned a B.S. in mechanical engineering from M.I.T. and recently was
honored with The British Energy Award for the Best Public Utility
Submission at the 2001 Business Journalist of the Year Awards.
(The awards are supported by the Corporation of London, the Confederation
of British Industry, the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the
Chartered Institute of Bankers, sponsored by
industry, and judged by prominent journalists, and representatives of
non-profit institutions.)
Eight years ago, the former New Yorker went to work at a new job in London.
He is now as much a fixture at The Economist as the clunky old Atex system.
Vijay is a former mechanical engineer turned brand manager at Procter &
Gamble turned reporter. In 1994, The Economist sent him out to Mexico to
open its first bureau in Latin America. He returned in 1998 with a tan, a
stash of tequila and fine cigars, and a very bad attitude about frigid
England.
He's gotten over it, and just recently took on the global environment
energy beat, with responsibility for topics ranging from the obvious to
agriculture, mining and commodities, as well as the impact of all of these
things on economic development.

Here's a link to his most recent article in The Economist
A brighter future?
The Economist, Feb 8th 2001
By Vijay Vaitheeswaran

http://economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=497405&CFID=2201824&CFTOKEN=35970405
For the better part of a century, governments the world over have been
running the power business as a command-and-control monopoly. Even in
free-market America, most people have been getting their power from stodgy
local utilities unencumbered by competition. This method has its merits:
most of the rich world is now wired up. But it conspicuously failed in the
developing countries, where over 2 billion people still have no access to
electricity. And now, as concerns about the reliability and
cleanliness of grid power grow, its limitations are becoming more apparent
in the industrial world, too.

Hi Andy,

I just wanted to do a note to confirm that Jim Perrello will be visiting you at
1.00pm this Friday.  I have attached a recent press release we issued announcing
Jim's appointment as CEO of Reuters Liquid Markets.  As discussed, the goal of
Friday's meeting is for Jim to provide feedback on the applicability of the
EnronOnline technology to the financial markets and particularly if, with little
customization, it could be used in the commercial paper marketplace.

I have copied Jim and would appreciate if you could email the details of where
he should go on Friday.

Cheers,
Simon

      <p>Dear Andrew,</p>
<!-- This mail was sent to ""Andrew Zipper"" <andy.zipper@enron.com>, who belongs to list
enl-members-html -->
<!-- CONTENT START -->

<p>The <b>General Accounting Office</b> made it official on Wednesday -
the investigative arm of Congress will <b>sue Vice President Dick
Cheney</b> over his <b>refusal to turn over information</b> related to
the work of his <b>energy task force</b>.  The GAO wants to know with
whom the task force met, especially within the energy industry.  The
<b>White House insists the request is inappropriate</b> and promises to
put up a fight.  On Thursday from the Washington bureau, we'll hear
where this dispute is headed.
<p>The Washington bureau will also have the latest on the Congressional
investigation into Enron.  Several new <b>Enron hearings</b> have been
added to next week's Congressional calendar.  <b>Two big hearings</b>
are scheduled for Monday and former <b>Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is expected
to make an appearance at both</b>.  This will be the <b>first time any
Enron executive has testified before Congress</b>.
<p>West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas will speak one-on-one
with <b>Southern California Edison President Bob Foster</b> Thursday.
He'll discuss <b>SoCal Edison's road to recovery</b> during 1:00 p.m. ET
newscast tomorrow.
<p>On Thursday from Houston, <b>Haynes and Boone LLP Attorney Lenny
Parkins</b> will join us to <b>provide legal analysis on the latest
Enron developments</b>.  Parkins is stopping by the bureau during the
noon ET newscast tomorrow.
<p><b>Energy Intelligence Group Bureau Chief Barbara Shook talks about
LNG projects</b>.  Some of the <b>projects that were scheduled to come
online in the U.S.</b> are now being <b>placed on the back burner due to
low gas prices</b>.  Catch Shook from the Houston bureau on Thursday.
<p>Finally from the NASDAQ in New York, <b>Tyumen Oil Company President
and CEO Simon Kukes</b> will join us.  He'll give us the <b>lowdown on
Russian oil issues</b> at 9:00 a.m. ET on Thursday.

"Two new additions to the periodic table of elements","
Element Name: WOMANIUM
Symbol: WO
Atomic Weight: (don't even go there)
Physical properties: Generally soft and round in form.
Boils at nothing and may freeze any time. Melts when
treated properly. Very bitter if not used well.
Chemical properties: Very active. Highly unstable.
Possesses Strong affinity with gold, silver, platinum,
and precious stones. Violent when left alone. Able to
absorb great amounts of exotic food. Turns slightly
green when placed next to a better specimen.
Usage: Highly ornamental. An extremely good catalyst
for dispersion of wealth. Probably the most powerful
income reducing agent known.
CAUTION: Highly explosive in inexperienced hands!
------------------------------------------------
Element Name: MANIUM
Symbol: XY
Atomic Weight: (180 +/- 50)
Physical properties: Solid at room temperature,
but gets bent out of shape easily. Fairly dense and
sometimes flaky. Difficult to find a pure sample. Due to
rust, aging samples are unable to create electricity as
easily as younger samples.
Chemical properties: Attempts to bond with WO any
chance it can get. Also tends to form strong bonds with
itself. Becomes explosive when mixed with KD
(Element: CHILDIUM) for prolonged periods of time.
Neutralize by saturating with alcohol.
Usage: None known. Possibly good methane source.
Good samples are able to produce large quantities on
command.
CAUTION: In the absence of WO, this element rapidly
decomposes and begins to smell.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Topping Out In Houston Again
WELL OILED

   Send the architects south. Silicon Valley may be powerless and
profitless, but Houston, the nation's energy capital and home to the
oil-baron excesses of the 1980s, is back in ""bidness."" The energy
giants in Texas have big fat wallets these days--and even bigger
construction plans. Not since the boom days of 1982, when trophy
architects like Philip Johnson and I.M. Pei reconfigured the skyline,
has Houston seen so much construction activity by the energy sector.

   Leading the parade, ironically, is Enron, an old energy behemoth
that has reinvented itself as a high-tech trading firm dealing in
everything from natural gas to Internet bandwidth. In fact, its new
40-story headquarters, designed by Cesar Pelli, will be fronted by a
seven-story ""podium""--or shorter building--to house what Enron is
calling the largest commodities-trading environment in the world.
   This environment, spread over four floors, each the size of a city
block, will become home this August to 2,000 employees trading
commodities that range from Old World (crude oil, petrochemicals,
steel and lumber) to New World (emission credits and derivatives).
Chairman Kenneth Lay and CEO Jeff Skilling are even moving from their
skyboxes to work in seventh-floor offices so they can peer down into
the pit.

   When the bigger 40-story structure is finished in December,
Enron's will be the first new skyscraper in downtown Houston since
1987--to be followed by three more by 2003. Besides Enron, Calpine
Corp., the nation's leading independent-power company, based in
California, will move into a new 32-story high-rise. And Reliant
Resources, the IPO spun off this month from its Houston parent to
deal with Texas' new deregulated electricity market, has signed on
for offices in a 36-story skyscraper.

   What's fueling the high-rise fever is simple: excess cash. Enron's
first-quarter revenues were up 281%, while Calpine's revenues and net
income were each up more than 400%--even with California's deadbeat
utility PG&E owing the company more than $300 million.

   After a decade of contraction in the business, with companies
having shut offices from New Orleans to Oklahoma, deregulation and
new marketing strategies are sparking Houston's renaissance. ""Enron
is a leading example of the new energy industry. Ten years ago, there
were no trading floors,"" points out Stephen Brown, senior economist
with the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. Both Calpine and Reliant
will also have trading operations in their new offices.

   Though Houston no longer relies so heavily on the energy business
(down to 48% of the local economy from 82% in 1982) the turnaround
sure feels good after the city lost more than 15,000 energy-sector
jobs two years ago, says Barton Smith, director of the Institute for
Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It has gained
those jobs back, plus some. Says Smith: ""The current boom is what's
keeping Houston afloat while the rest of the country is suffering.""

   None of this matters to real Houston lovers, of course. They're
just interested in bragging rights. After a bad decade, they're
beginning to sound like the biggest and the best in Texas again.
""Boomlet?"" says Laura Schwartz, spokeswoman at Enron. ""It's more than
a mini-boom. It's a boom.""

"Media Preparedness Training","
RE: Media Preparedness Session, June 12, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Doubletree Hotel, Lamar Room (downtown)

Team 

You may be wondering what our Media Preparedness Session on June 12 is about.  Here's the logic...   
We are in the enviable position of having significant media interest in the genius behind EnronOnline and our mid/back office services while, at the same time, we are trying to leverage our e-commerce reputation at Net Works.  We can use this to our commercial advantage, e.g. advertising without the expense.  Dealing with the media, however, can be like getting behind the wheel of a race car with no training -- you might have fun for a while but eventually crash.  That's why it's important that we set aside some time to get ready for the race.

We have hired The Ammerman Experience, a Houston-based media consultant, to facilitate the session, which includes interactive exercises in dealing with reporters.  I think you will find it rewarding not only in terms of helping your business, but for your own executive development.  Bring your best ideas for how to position Net Works for a big second half.

I hope we can have some fun with this.

Greg Piper

 	  	 Dear Andrew,

Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay breaks his silence - Lay is expected to testify in front of a Congressional hearing on Monday. We are planning to provide live coverage of the entire hearing in addition to our regular newscasts. Our Washington bureau will also be reporting live from the hearing every hour with updates. The hearing is one of 12 scheduled in Congress next week related to the Enron collapse. 

In addition to appearances by Lay, former CEO Jeff Skilling and former CFO Andrew Fastow will testify Thursday in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The Washington bureau will track this hearing, and any others that may have an impact on the energy sector. 

Our Houston bureau will also have reaction to former Enron CEO Ken Lay's testimony in Washington. 

In the first legal showdown over electricity deregulation in Texas, two state agencies are entangled in a lawsuit over rates set under the state's deregulation program. The Office of the Public Utility Council is suing the Public Utility Commission over the rates a default provider can charge in the western service territory for TXU Corporation. We'll have all the details from the Houston bureau on Monday. 

West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas talks with California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch about the proposed Rate Agreement with the California Department of Water Resources. Lynch says the PUC, DWR and Wall Street made a number of compromises in order for an acceptable deal to materialize. 

Director of the California Department of Finance Timothy Gage also talks with Kym about the proposed Rate Agreement between the CPUC and the CDWR. He'll discuss the bridge loans that will hold the state over until $12.5 billion in consumer-backed energy bonds are issued. Gage will also discuss the state's budget crisis and how to secure California's energy future on Monday. 

E Source Energy Industry Analyst Matthew Joyce comes to us from Boulder on Monday during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast. Joyce has the latest on what former Enron customers are doing since the fall of the energy giant. 

Closing Prices for Friday, Feb. 1, 2002	
 	 Crude:	 $20.38/bbl	 +$0.90	
 	 Unleaded:	 $0.6034/gallon	 +$0.0292	
 	 Heating Oil:	 $0.5531/gallon	 +$0.0215	
 	 Gas:	 $2.138/mmBtu	 unchanged	
 	 Fwd uE(Mar.):	 $3.61/mmBtu	 +$0.22	

Newscast Update: Starting at 9:30 a.m. ET, we'll have wall-to-wall coverage of former Enron CEO Ken Lay's testimony at a Congressional hearing in Washington. You can view the hearing as it happens by going to the ENL Video Library. We hope you'll take some time to watch this special coverage on Monday. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests reschedule or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Re: Lord Vader,","Good Morning,

No problem, I have gotten good at cold calling people to peddle my
wares. New Power shall not be spared.

Yes, the engagement has been great, the two families met a few weeks ago
for the first time, and all went well. Although I think her father
believes I am just marrying Wendy for her green card (just kidding).

Yes, Sunny is gone and so are 15 million of his closest friends. And I
believe you are correct that Alex starts at Allegheny today, although I
don't think it is trading related.

I will speak to you later this week.

Best Regards,

Jorg

Our intention is that the contact with NYMEX is to be a joint one, by your team and that of Enron Metals but ""a deal"" if done would by necessity have lead commercial input from the metals team.

"RE: EnronOnline in the palm of your hand","Hi Greg,

The ETS guys currently listen to our TIB traffic and use it in some of their internal applications.  This is a practice that I have never liked, primarily because these messages are intended to be internal to the EOL application suite, and we need the flexibility to change them as necessary.  As an example, as part of a recent exercise to reduce the overall network traffic, we re-engineered the entire EOL messaging layer.  However, it took us months to roll that change to production because we had to wait for the many pirates of our data to change to the new message structure. 

Our message to these guys has always been that we cannot support these efforts, and that we maintain the freedom to change our messaging at any time.  In practice, however, that is not realistic.  The ""EnronOnline in the palm of your hand"" e-mail refers to an application service that ETS has built on top of our message traffic that allows IPAQ users to request EOL prices.  This is particularly problematic, because as Andy as said, we must maintain control of the EnronOnline brand.  We don't have any control of the quality of this application.  The idea is a good one, so it is likely that if it is made available, our traders will be using it.  Or worse, our executives.  At that point, we have no choice but to fully support it.  As such, this kind of thing circumvents our prioritization process.  

Andy's message to Steve (below) is very gracious.  Frankly, I believe the message should simply be ""kill this"".

Steve,

I understand that you are rolling this product out for internal users only. In that case I have a couple of thoughts

1). I have no problem with an internal launch of this. If external, I have a very big problem.

2). I think it would be better for the relationship between ETS and ENW had you informed us of your intention to do this. You are using the EnronOnline brand and whether that is internal or external it is ours to manage. as this was a complete surprise to us. It doesn't really seem like just a pipeline risk management product.

3). Because this was not part of our development and operations effort, we cannot support the product technically. There will be no change management. Given the amount of changes we do to our back end there is a high likelihood that in the future your product will cease to function

4). It looks pretty good and I commend your ingenuity. 

If you disagree with any of this please feel free to let me know.

Andy Zipper

"John Cummings Update","Andy & Dave

This is to update you on a few meetings I have had and update you on my activities.

Last week I met with:
Neste Petroelum - Their US Activities are not very applicable, but they are the Finnish National Oil Company and the trader I met with felt there may be some application with their physical European business.  They are a big producer of ""clean"" gasoline and diesel that goes into the EU.  He is going to supply an appropriate contact.

Martin Resources - This is a medium size private company and the result of this meeting beyond general market intelligence was a possible interest in showing one market for sulfuric acid, which is a market where they have a Gulf Coast franchise.  My contact who is one of the owners and he will revert after having interanl discussions

Enterprise - This meeting got postpones until this coming Friday due to a crisis they had.  I did spend a little time with Monty Wells (I think that was his names)  who is the SVP incharge of the NGL's.  I only presented the idea briefly for him tho think about.  My meeting on Friday is with Jim Teague, President & CEO of Enterprise NGL division.

Tauber - Tauber is a medium sized trading company with $1 Billion in Revenues.  they are active in Petrochemicals, NGL, Refined Products, and heavy oils.  There was an interest and Tauber is an active EOL user and fan.  My contact Scott Posednik runs the Petrochemical book and his biggest deal breaker was the security of the transaction information.  He indicated the 1% chance that one of the EOL people with access to their data could share that with the commercial groups is a concern.  He is going to discuss this with his colleagues and come back to us with their interest.  They do a lot of trading in physical Raffinates, Naphtha, etc.

Koch Hydrocarbons - This meeting was well timed as they are actively looking at their e-commerce startegy.  I met with Mark Dobbins SVP -Trading and Ron Baker who runs their Olephins and NGL books.  Their biggest hurdle is going to be getting comfortable making markets.  Another issue will how the credit matrix works.  It appears if they did something that they might need something a little more sophistacated than the basic offering.  One final issue will be the reps and warranties made by Enron contractually as to the sharing of information with our business groups and the security of the data.  They have apparently had an ordeal negotiating their master agreements to transact on EnronOnline and are warry of Enron's contracts.   They are going to have some internal discussions and revert next week.

Shell Us Trading (SUSCO) - I had a very good conversation with Steven Murray and he was supposed to get back with me early this week about setting up a meeting.  The boundries have been established that our interest would be in their making markets for Oil, Petrochemicals, NGLs and Chemicals only.  Gas and Power are currently out of bounds.  

This week
I am Vancouver today and tommorrow attending a Wood products conference and I will be in Las Vegas on Thursday.  After thoroughly reviewing the pulp and paper industry I think that the only sectors that would easily fit into this model will be the waste paper and lumber. I have had and will have discussion with other producers, but they are still hung up on branding and their products not being commodities ect.  I am Vancouver and have several meetings together with the Rob Scheuer with lumber producers about showing offers.  In Las Vegas, there is a conference where Ray Bowen is the keynote speaker and there are several potential counterparties attending , including Waste Management.  My intent is not to spend too much time on Pulp and Paper and these two trips will allow me to quickly determine who the possible prospects are.

Leave me a message at x36413 if you have any questions or comments

Enron debt sinks on credit crunch fears


By Nancy Leinfuss 

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Bonds of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ene&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>), which is trying to curb fears that it faces a credit crunch, fell sharply on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported the energy giant on Thursday drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and is in talks with its banks about obtaining a new multibillion dollar credit line.

	

Houston-based Enron's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said late on Thursday that the company, the largest U.S. energy trader with $67.3 billion of assets, had drawn down from its credit lines to obtain more than $1 billion in cash to alleviate concerns about its liquidity. 

``There's been a lot of downward pressure on Enron following the negative news,'' said an investment-grade bond trader. ``Investment-grade accounts have been trying to exit those bonds, but there hasn't been any support from either high-yield or hedge funds.'' 

Enron did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 

Enron's investment-grade 6.40 percent notes due in 2006, which just two weeks ago were quoted to yield 2.3 percentage points more than five-year U.S. Treasuries, are now quoted at a dollar price, like junk bonds. They were bid Friday at 80 cents on the dollar, with a yield to maturity of 12.09 percent, or 8.34 percentage points more than Treasuries. 

Enron's 8.31 percent issue due 2003 fell a similar amount on Friday, and also trades at 80 cents on the dollar, traders said. 

The company's stock, meanwhile, has lost more than half of its value in the last two weeks as investors began questioning off-the-balance-sheet transactions between the company and two limited partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking at those transactions for possible conflicts of interest. 

Enron ousted Fastow on Wednesday. 

The shares were down $1.09, or 6.7 percent, at $15.26 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade. 

CREDIT RATINGS AT RISK 

On Thursday, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's revised Enron's outlook to negative while affirming its long- and short-term credit ratings of ``BBB-plus'' and ``A-2.'' 

S&P said it is closely monitoring Enron's capital needs and liquidity position, which it considers crucial to the success of the company's core business operations. 

``Assurances from the top levels of Enron management that the company will maintain its commitment to its credit quality and that no steps are being taken to support the company's common stock price at the expense of credit quality provide further support for Enron's ratings,'' S&P said. 

S&P said it revised its outlook after the big drop in Enron's market capitalization this week, which it said has hurt the company's financial flexibility and may impede management's ability to rebuild the balance sheet and sell assets in a timely manner. 

``The negative outlook acknowledges the potential for erosion of the company's credit quality as investor confidence in the company's management has waned,'' S&P said. 

Another credit rating agency, Fitch, on Thursday warned it may downgrade Enron's debt, saying the erosion of consumer confidence could block the company's access to capital markets.

Greg.

Welcome back!

Please advise ASAP whether or not your group is willing to give Bloomberg live access to Steel quotes on EOL, as the Paper group is willing to do. This live or not format will determine the form and substance of the agreement with Bloomberg.

I can not go forward with this negotiation with Bloomberg without knowing the format of the information, we will provide.

Thanks,

Greg,

As a follow-up to my voicemail today,if we do not want to give Bloomberg access to live quotes on EOL, Bloomberg is insisting on a very complex and most onerous and one-sided agreement, which is counter to Enron corporate policies.  

That Bloomberg long form is very inflexible and will take protracted negotiation. Please check with Andy to see if we can give them live access, just as the Paper group is willing to give them on EOL and Clickpaper.

Bloomberg has given the Paper Group a simple onepage letter authorization, which is acceptable to Enron. If we would give them live access,like the Paper Group, this authorization letter could be resolved immediately.

Please advise soonest.

"RE: Yo","Going okay.  I have been going at night a lot as our weekends are filled with 3 different sports now.  Been doing a fair amount of IFR but no actual.  Getting night landings back into shape was amusing.  Didn't break anything.  How much flying do you are you doing in actual IFR?  We don't have stormscopes or anything so a chance of embedded tstorms means I don't go.  I'm hoping they get another Bonanza or Mooney or something.  I would rather get a complex sign-off on the club's insurance nickel than my own.  Still angling to buy a plane at the end of the year.  I'm thinking of a Grumman Tiger.  They are faster than anything with fixed gear (other than a Cirrus), pretty cheap, and fine for one or two people.  Since I'm not allowed to take the kids, that's okay.

Don't know about the AGA....Seems to be that we are having harder and harder tme as an industry getting it right.

I flew to little rock last weekend for a BPPP bonanza school and had a really cool instructor who was a retired colonel in USAF and F4 pilot. Lots of good stories. Beautiful weeknd for flying.
Saw Jack Hirsch but didn't ask him about his club's bonanza...

How is yor flying going ?

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

 	 	    Dear Andrew,  It's official: Sen. Jim Jeffords is leaving the Republican Party and declares himself an Independent.  This move is going to have repercussions touching aspects in every area of legislation, and will undoubtedly affect the national energy policy.  We'll continue to update you on this situation from our Washington bureau.     Republicans and Democrats are nearing an agreement on the Electricity Emergency Relief Act.  Compromise language is being discussed behind closed doors, and members hope to resolve their differences when the markup continues Friday morning.   In a continuing effort to promote the Bush administration's energy plan, the Department of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is scheduled to travel to a nuclear power plant in Maryland on Friday.  Correspondent Peter Cook is scheduled to be along for the ride.  Tuesday, Peter brings us details of his trip to Maryland.    Also on Friday, I'm scheduled to speak with U.S. Chamber of Commerce Vice President of Energy Policy William Kovacs. He'll join us from Washington, D.C. to preview an energy meeting at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce where Vice President Dick Cheney will talk about the White House energy plan.  Catch my interview with Kovacs in the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast.     ENL's Gale Smith reports the Houston bureau is scheduled to give us an update from the ongoing story of 70,000 royalty owners who are filing a class action lawsuit against ExxonMobil.  The royalty owners allege Exxon unfairly determined the royalties they should receive from natural gas and natural gas liquids sales.  On Wednesday, a San Antonio U.S. District Judge certified the lawsuit filed by a Houston law firm.  Gale says the Houston bureau will bring you reactions from Exxon officials on Friday.     Dorothea El Mallakh, the Executive Director of the International Research Center for Energy and Economic Development is also scheduled to join us from our Houston bureau.  She says conservation is not synonymous with deprivation, and the current energy issue is not a problem with a quick solution.  We'll bring you more from Mallakh in the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast on Friday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

ICE Opens Singapore Office;Eyes Asia Oil Derivative Trade

05/23/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- The Intercontinental Exchange Inc., or ICE, has
opened an office in Singapore as part of a move to attract more Asian oil
derivative trade, an ICE spokeswoman said Wednesday.

  The spokeswoman said an office had been opened in Singapore because those in
London and the U.S. weren't sufficient to serve Asian customers. The volume
traded on ICE was increasing on a daily basis, she said.
  Asian derivatives offered by the Internet-based trading system include
Singapore gasoil, high sulfur fuel oil, kerosene and naphtha oil product
swaps, as well as Dubai and Tapis crude oil swaps.

  ICE hopes to eventually attract physical trade to its platform, but the
spokeswoman said this was complicated and would take some time to implement.

  Over-the-counter brokers in Singapore are under pressure from the system,
which they acknowledge is gaining market share at their expense. They also
face a challenge from a new forward curve trading platform offered by Platts,
a division of the Magraw-Hill Group of companies (MHP).

  Oil traders' opinions of the new system vary, but most say it's more
convenient, adding that, unlike ICE, the new Platts system may have
difficultly attracting sufficient liquidity.

  ""It's easier to trade (oil swaps) on ICE,"" said one trader. He also pointed
to the anonymity ICE offered as an advantage.

  But he said physical trading on ICE would be difficult, and was unlikely to
threaten Platts' central role in the physical market. ICE swaps, as with OTC
swaps, will be settled against Platts' Singapore physical quotes.

  ICE is an Atlanta-based company owned by a number of oil companies and
traders, including oil majors BP PLC (BP), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and Royal
Dutch/Shell Group (RD). The system is unregulated.

  Revenue is generated through a commission on each trade.

  One trader working for an ICE equity holder said he wasn't obliged to trade
on the system, but did so anyway because he liked it.

"RE: re:stuff","Thanks.

Does Viola have a trusted sidekick who he will trust to get a deal done with us?  How do we get going with institutions as well?

I will call Shankman and Friedman and get some scoop on Dow.

How would we get started with  fee?  If we actually do this, I think it should be more of a brokerage fee for access to liquidity as opposed to charging the Enron traders.

1). Hickerson does not have any products up yet. I need to find out from Bridges where we are with Cargill. He has been in meetings all morning, I will revert when I know.

2). To be honest I think we are nowhere with Dow, but I have left that to Berberian. I haven't heard a peep from anyone on this. I will find out.

3). I think it is 50/50 on GM. They clearly are interested, but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish. They do want to make markets. I think our best bet is an EOL product hosting deal, but their internal process will be excruciating. Next step is they will meet with alan Engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on EOL.

4). I have not been moving forward on service level contract because I do not think it really adds any value at the present time.

5). I do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to EOL. This should not be viewed as a commission.

6). I spoke with Vin Viola of NYMEX and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals. He is tough to pin down and negotiate with but we will run this down by end of next week.

7). Re:kiodex, it is coming slowly as we have a lot of things on the development/testing schedule right now.

8). As you know we are in receipt of the ICE API. We have not been able to do much work on it given 7).

Subject: Exchange Update


HoustonStreet:  Full connectivity to the stage environment was resolved on Tuesday.  Testing is being done with the number of updates flowing through our sys to theirs.  The number of updates were on avg close to 20-40 per second.  Ricky Oberai was not able to view their web site as they do not have their .cab file ready to load on our side to view the price updates as we send them.  They have advised they are seeing the prices on their side internally.  John Applegate called and advised they should have the .cab file to download sometime tomorrow.  There is more testing scheduled for 8am Central in the morning.
 
TrueQuote:  Finally got a hold of Steward Clark regarding any type of issues.  Testing with sending data with Ricky at 5pm today.  Also, they have upgraded their servers over the last couple of weeks.  They are handling approx, 10-20, maybe max 25 in a couple of bundles.  Finished a call with Stewart and Ricky with testing and TQ will be looking into peeling off a process which is eating up a large number of resources.  What has been stated by Stewart is they are receiving another server tomorrow and will migrate the database or another component to that box to resolve any resource issue.
 
ClickPaper:  As of Tuesday, they had filled 3 trades and one failed, the failed which was the test ran on Friday for testing purposes.  They are working out some bugs in the TEST/STAGE env for exchange.

"Follow up meeting with Reuters","

Hi Andy,

Re our tel conversation.  I've had another idea which, if you are receptive,
will actually help me get a much larger across the board buy-in to the concept
that you have presented.  If your team would be willing to come back to NY next
Thursday, I would be able to get a larger cross-section of individuals to attend
a meeting here than could come down to Houston.  I personally believe this will
improve the chances of getting a wider level of support in Reuters, which at
this stage is important given some of the concerns that have been raised.  Why
don't you have a think about the feasibility and i will call you tomorrow to
discuss.  I understand the issues why a demonstration in Houston would work
better.  However in terms of making positive progress, I would recommend that
this would be the best way forward.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Andy,

I just wanted to do a note to confirm that Jim Perrello will be visiting you at
1.00pm this Friday.  I have attached a recent press release we issued announcing
Jim's appointment as CEO of Reuters Liquid Markets.  As discussed, the goal of
Friday's meeting is for Jim to provide feedback on the applicability of the
EnronOnline technology to the financial markets and particularly if, with little
customization, it could be used in the commercial paper marketplace.

I have copied Jim and would appreciate if you could email the details of where
he should go on Friday.

Cheers,
Simon

With a target of 250,000 recruited volunteers by March 2004, Experience Corps needed a system to handle recruiting, opportunity matching, and other volunteer processes. Savvion enabled the organization to automate volunteer processes by collecting applicant data, monitoring recruitment, and cross-referencing volunteer databases. Savvion implemented this system in just a matter of weeks.

 	  	 Dear Andrew,

The Washington bureau will bring us more on the EPA decision to recommend changes to the nation's fuel specifications on Thursday. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the proposal to reduce the number of boutique fuels across the country will likely draw mixed reaction. 

We'll have the latest on energy legislation from the Senate. There continues to be mixed signals coming from both parties on the likelihood of a deal that could pave the way for a comprehensive energy bill to reach the floor. 

Also in Washington, a long list of energy influentials will speak at the Alliance to Save Energy's Summit on Energy Efficiency. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and S. David Freeman, the Chairman of California's new state power authority are among the scheduled participants. We'll have coverage of the Summit from the Washington bureau on Thursday. 

Houston has long been called the energy capital of the world and downtown Houston has always been considered the energy corridor. Now the Woodlands, a community located north of Houston, is staking its claim as the next energy corridor of the area. On Thursday the Woodlands Chamber of Commerce is hosting an energy forum to discuss the area's growth and ways to attract more companies. We'll bring you details from the Houston bureau tomorrow. 

We'll take a rare look Thursday into the largest nuclear power plant in Texas. South Texas Project Electric Generating Station invited members of the news media to tour secured areas as nuclear plants around the country upgrade security in light of the threats and attacks on America. 

Also from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research Mark Meyer will drop by to discuss how oil stocks are doing this quarter. Catch Meyer during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast. 

The California Public Utilities Commission is meeting on Thursday. West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the agenda may include the Rate Agreement between the CDWR and the PUC along with the issue of Direct Access. 

Kym also reports, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District is boosting its capacity. This move will add to what is already the largest utility-owned distributed photovoltaic system in the world. Kym will bring us details on Thursday. 

Finally from the West Coast bureau, we'll have comments from California Governor Gray Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio on the federal government's plans to expand Path 15. Join us for these stories from the West Coast bureau tomorrow. 

From ENL Headquarters on Thursday, Williams Energy Partners L.P. Chief Financial Officer Don Wellendorf will join us to discuss the company's third-quarter earnings. And Edward Jones Senior Energy Analyst Zach Wagner will join us from St. Louis to continue the discussion on earnings. Wagner will discuss Enron during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"RE: Global Strategic Sourcing Question","The DealBench business case applies but the technology stinks.  We are planning to redesign DealBench with the idea to allow it to integrate with EOL.  The concept is to allow a product to evolve from auctions to principal to specialist based markets.

Short term, GSS can try to use DB.

Why wouldn't we use the deal bench auction platform ? This provides for open auctions with participants changing their bids in real time, no ?

After some preliminary analysis, it does not look like our big counterparties i.e. Dynegy, Rliant, Duke, El Paso etc., are closing down their positions. On the contrary their net positions seem to be rising. This is only for NYMEX related financial instruments, I haven't looked at phys or power yet.

Just thought you would like to know.

"Client Services","Today, after an extended effort to resolve certain professional differences,
Bruce Gilardi decided to offer his resignation.  I determined that it was in
the company's best interest for me immediately to accept it.

I'd like to acknowledge Bruce for the important contributions he made, and
the standard he set for Kiodex to offer world-class client services.  We all
wish him the very best in whatever professional endeavors he chooses to
pursue.

Kiodex is stronger than it's ever been, thanks to all of you.  Our
differences with Bruce relate to his role in the Company's management.  Raj
M and I are available to speak with anyone at Kiodex who would like to talk
about Bruce's departure.  Please send either one of us a meeting request.

Raj M and I will be sharing with you our plans for Client Services in the
very near future.

All the best,

""Enron Activity - Dynegy Direct""
""Enron Activity - ICE""

  

Note: Total activity for Dynegy Direct is not available, therefore Enron's Percentage can not be calculated.

We would hold less than 1% of the equity in ICE - so no control at all

If we accept the Offer, and assuming the Offer receives sufficient acceptances from the other IPE shareholders, then we would hold equity in ICE (in the form of A and B Shares)

Subject:	Recommended Offer by ICE for IPE Holdings

This is to point out to you the approaching deadline for accepting ICE's Offer for IPE Holdings.  If we wish to accept this Offer, we must do so no later than 3 pm on Tuesday 29 May.

In the meantime, Michael has received calls from Richard Ward (IPE's CEO) inquiring as to our position, and it would be my view that we should accept the Offer. (Note that if ICE receives acceptances of 90% or more, then our shares in IPE Holdings will in any event be mandatorily acquired.  And assuming that such level of acceptances will be received, there is no reason for not accepting the Offer).

Please would you let me know whether you wish to accept the Offer.  Ideally, if we are to do so, I would plan to send the acceptance by close of business on Friday 25 May.


Thanks
Justin

Lydia - would you please pass this on to Andy Zipper.

Andy, my name is Kevin Morrissey.  I work on special
projects for a couple of our executives, and have been
designated point person for Enron opportunities.
First Data Corp is a processing company and money movement
company. We own Western Union, which passes billions of
dollars, and do the processing and settlement for credit
cards-doing over half of all Visa and Master Card. We pass
and settle trillions of dollars a year.  We have a very
large network with banks and financial institutions.
We started doing some processing for Enron Energy Services a
year ago, and think there are other opportunities for both
our companies.  I would like to spend some time with you
understanding Enron On Line to see what we might do for each
other.(Lou Casari  gave me your name - he said you were the
best person to explain EOL). I will be in Houston next week
and wonder if you have some time to meet with me on Tuesday
May 29 or Wednesday May 30. I have some open time 3-5 PM on
both days. If you could leave me a message, or have Lydia
leave me a call at 303-488-8226, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks.
Looking forward to meeting you.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

What is the latest with Dow as it relates to Net Works?

What are your thoughts and next steps on GM?

How are we doing on a contract with service levels between EnronOnline and EWS?  Do you belive that this is a good thing in the first place?

Should we try to build a case to start charging for people to get at the liquidity on EOL?

Is Shults going to find a clearer and get some locals and institutions as sub users to a clearing master?

 	 	    Dear Andrew,  International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale is on his way to the 115th OPEC Conference Tuesday and Wednesday, and is scheduled to speak with OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez.  We'll bring you Wolfgang's exclusive interview with Rodriguez later next week.  Wolfgang also tells us he may have an interview with Senior Energy Analyst at the Center for Global Energy Studies Julian Lee.  Log on all next week for updates from Wolfgang's trip.   The House and Senate are back in session next week, and Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford expects a chaotic week of reorganization ahead.  The power shift in the Senate is the big news on Capitol Hill, and Jay anticipates official movement to begin by Tuesday.  The Washington bureau will follow the changes taking place in leadership and the key energy chairmanships.     Jay also says Interior Secretary Gale Norton is scheduled to testify before the House Resources Committee.  She's expected to defend the administration's national energy policy.  Additionally next week, the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee will conduct a hearing on conservation and energy efficiency.  We'll follow these stories and more from the Washington bureau next week.     Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante reports the current boom in the energy industry is creating a need for qualified employees.  Next week Kim is scheduled to take a look at companies implementing training programs for high school and college students that groom them for positions within the industry.     Also from Houston, ENL's Gale Smith brings us a report on minority-owned energy-related businesses.  Gale is scheduled to speak with a Houston businessman who turned his company into a multi-million dollar operation that employs mostly minorities.  The Houston bureau will bring us details next week.   We're also scheduled to talk with Vice President of Omega Oil Company Andy Ashby from Houston next week.  Ashby knows the ins and outs of production methods, and will discuss below the reservoir production, coal bed methane production and domestic oil and gas production.  We're scheduled to speak with Ashby on Tuesday.    I'm leaving for vacation on Friday, and ENL's Stephanie Stanton and Washington Correspondent Peter Cook are sharing anchoring duties next week.  I'm also passing the pen to Peter.  He'll bring you the nightly e-mail wrap while I'm away.      Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

 	  	 Dear Andrew,

Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay will not testify at either Congressional hearing this week. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says because of Lay's decision not to appear, the Senate Commerce Committee is expected to authorize the issuance of a subpoena to Lay as early as Tuesday morning. Two House subcommittees could soon issue their own subpoenas as well. A subpoena would compel Lay to appear, but it does not guarantee he will testify - he could invoke his constitutional right not to speak. 

Other hearings involving Enron will proceed as planned, with three hearings scheduled for Tuesday morning. One of the hearings involves Enron board member William Powers, who will testify in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight Subcommittee. Powers led the internal investigation at Enron, resulting in a report released this weekend that was highly critical of the company's management team. We'll have highlights from Powers' testimony on Tuesday from Washington. 

Unsecured creditors can help ensure a better rate of return on what they're owed by Enron through claims trading. That's according to Haynes and Boone LLP Attorney Lenny Parkins. He'll join us during the noon ET newscast from the Houston bureau to discuss the process of claims trading and how creditors can assure they will receive some sort of payment. 

Also from Houston on Tuesday, Williams Gas Pipeline CEO Doug Whisenant talks about pipeline safety following September 11. He'll also discuss the future of Williams Gas Pipelines. 

We'll have more from the one-on-one interview between West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas and California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Kym says Lynch will discuss the ongoing negotiations with generators to rework the state's long-term power contracts.

Subject:	EnronOnline Opportunity with i2


As background for Mr. Lay's call to Sanjiv Sidhu of i2 concerning the EnronOnline opportunity, here is a brief summary of where we stand and our suggestions:

History of Enron/i2 Discussions

i2 was one the initial companies contacted by Enron Net Works (ENW) for the EnronOnline commercial discussion.
The focus of the Enron/i2 discussion earlier this year was a complete sale of the software asset that drives EnronOnline to i2.
i2 expressed considerable interest in the opportunity below the executive level, but ENW had difficulty getting a concrete bid or proposal from i2.
In order to get the discussion started, ENW provided an offer to i2.
i2's response to the Enron offer was that they considered it high and that they would prefer to partner with Enron in some manner in addition to some form of purchase.
ENW expressed interest in talking with i2 about this and requested that they outline their preferred deal to Enron.
ENW never received a term sheet or other information on a new price and partnering concept from i2.

Current Status of EnronOnline Commercial Initiative

Since those early discussions with i2, ENW has discussed the EnronOnline opportunity with other selected technology companies, and is now considering bids from several potential counterparties.  
Generally speaking the deal structure that appears to provide the best opportunity for both parties entails involvement by ENW after the transaction, in the form of equity participation or royalty payments or both, as well as the transfer of some Enron people.  
This seems to move us into the realm of a ""partnership"" structure that could fit the initial i2 interest.

Current Enron/i2 Status

Rex Shelby talked briefly with Greg Brady, i2 CEO, at a conference in NYC two weeks ago.  
Greg Brady expressed interest in renewing talks around the EnronOnline opportunity.  

Current Status of the Sale Opportunity

We are now reaching the point in the process at which we need to determine whether there is an interest from i2.
We want to make sure we give i2 the opportunity to outline a proposal with a price as well as outline their needs for a relationship going forward, or to confirm that they are not interested.

Suggested Message to Sanjiv Sidhu

Our suggested message to Sanjiv is:
.
1.	Enron remains interested in exploring this opportunity with i2 if there is a genuine interest from i2.
2.  	Enron is open to considering deal structures that provide incentive for participation by Enron after the transaction.
3.  	Enron is moving down the path with other parties, so if i2 has an interest, we would need to start working with them soon.

Thank you for your assistance on this.  Please let us know if you need more information.

"Conagra is our newest beta customer!","Last week, our sales team signed Conagra Foods, a Fortune 100 company, to a
beta license for the Risk Workbench.  Based in Omaha, ConAgra is North
America's largest foodservice supplier and the nation's second largest name
in retail foods (www.conagra.com).  In 2000, Conagra had revenues of over
$25 billion, making it 68th on the Fortune 1000 list.  Many of their
consumer brands are household names: Hunt's tomato products, Healthy Choice,
Louis Kemp, Libby's, Wesson, Country Pride, Blue Bonnet, Parkay, Reddi-wip,
Marie Callender's, Butterball, Chef Boyardee, Orville Redenbacher's, Peter
Pan, and Swiss Miss.
They currently have a large risk management and trading operation in Omaha
that hedges their exposure to energy and agricultural prices while engaging
in some speculative trading.  Kiodex will work directly with the principals
in this division as well as senior management as they adopt the Risk
Workbench for the purpose of conducting this mission critical function.
Conagra represents a tremendous opportunity for Kiodex to enroll a Fortune
100 company in becoming a high-profile reference account for us as we launch
on August 23rd.  Our focus, beginning on July 9th, will be on converting
this trophy client into a full paying customer (they are paying to
participate in the beta program) of the Risk Workbench.  I ask all of you to
help us realize this opportunity.
I would like to especially acknowledge Russ Chalom in our sales department
for his work on this account.  For the past 2 months, he has been
aggressively courting Conagra, performing demonstrations for senior
management, including the CEO.  His lucid delivery and cogent explanation of
the Risk Workbench value proposition created this opportunity for all of us.
Well done, Russ!
