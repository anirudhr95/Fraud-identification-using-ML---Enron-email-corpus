market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants:

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following enhancements to the
public web
server (www.nyiso.com), MIS and SPIDER that will be implemented on
September 12,
2001.

Generation Supplier Issues Development Project:

? Units may operate as Energy Limited Resources (ELR). Qualifying units
that
have their schedules modified will NOT be subjected to any financial harm
from
the obligation to cover energy balancing charges.

? Units may operate as Capacity Limited Resources (CLR). Bid rules will be
modified such that units may indicate an upper MW operating limit separate
from
the Upper Operating Limit (UOL). SCUC, BME, and SCD will honor this limit
under certain environmental and operating situations.

? Payment rules for start-up will be modified. Units will receive start-up
payments
for both the Day Ahead and Real-Time market if they are economically
qualified
and are scheduled in each market.

A Technical Bulletin describing the full details of ELR/CLR will be
released shortly.
If you any questions, please contact your Customer Relations Representative
or call the
Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS 

Enron Global Markets - Coal and Emissions Trading 
The first Enron Online synfuel trade occurred this past week, establishing EnronOnline as the only online marketplace for synfuel.  The purpose of bringing synfuel on EnronOnline is to provide market transparency between the coal/synfuel spread.  

The coal cash book, which began trading only two months ago, has traded over 2 million spot tons.  The fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies, while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal.  

Enron Energy and Operational Services - ENA Solid Fuel Initiative 
ENA started development of a Coal Initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide Enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections.  Because of the culture shock associated the use of the words  'Enron' and 'coal' in the same sentence, consideration was been given to changing the name to DNG (Dense Natural Gas); however, we went with Solid Fuel Initiative.

This initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ENA feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit.  The primary areas are Texas, Florida, southeastern Ohio and the central Rocky Mountain Area.  There are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued:  Brownsville, TX and Brighton FL.  In Brownsville, the Team secured formal Owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the Brownsville Ship Channel.  This approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay.

A 500 MW facility is being considered for Brownsville.  As conceptualized, it will consist of two - 250 MW (net) CFB units (Circulating Fluidized Bed) Boilers. The boilers will be fired by petroleum coke (petcoke) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible.  One of the advantages of locating this facility near Brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity.  There is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity.  As stated the plant is initially 500 MW, but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 MW facility.

The EEOS team is starting to grow and currently includes Hilda Akin & Cheryl Kent, Project Admin Assistants, Bill Fox as PEM, and Paula Solomon as PCM.  As the project develops there will be more team members required.  In addition, as the Florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team.   

eSource 
eSource, Enron's research group, recently posted on its website a Forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies.  These reports are free and available to all Enron employees on the eSource Hot Topics page at http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp <http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp>.  To date, over 1,600 employees have downloaded ""Spending Wisely on Private Hubs"", a report valued at $2,000.  Over 1,100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports, provided by Investext.  The reports, which are updated continuously, are presented in folders by company and industry.  New folders are being added upon request.  To submit a suggestion for a new folder, please complete the suggestion form at http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp <http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp>.  

Watch for the new eSource bulletin, The Source.  It will feature frequently requested searches, tips on finding information, new products, services, and events.

Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's information needs, eSource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to Enron employees.  

Enron Freight Markets 
EFM signed a firm contract with Streamline Shippers Association last week to provide truckload capacity for one-year with EFM's option to extend the contract for up to an additional year.  Streamline transloads international shipments that enter the U.S. through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  Streamline then consolidates the shipments into full truckloads destined to the major population centers throughout the country.  EFM will begin moving shipments to northeast destinations this week.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

West Power
On August 31, 2001, West Power Origination closed the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Southwest Power to Black Hills Energy Corp.  The sale to Black Hills concluded a two year strategy associated with the acquisition and expansion of the 50MW Las Vegas Cogeneration facility.   The 230MW Las Vegas II expansion project initiated in January 2000 consists of two, 2x1 systems utilizing LM 6000 PC technology in combined cycle. In May of this year, West Power Origination secured a 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply Company for the entire output of the expansion project.  The Las Vegas II expansion project is currently under construction and is scheduled to go commercial in September 2002.  This transaction utilized many of Enron's technical, financial and commodity capabilities.  Congratulations to everyone who made it a success.

News from the Global Flash

EES Europe Celebrates Pirelli Deal
EES Europe is celebrating another deal with an attractive brand name after clinching a three-year contract with Pirelli Cables and Systems, the world's leading energy cable manufacturer. The deal gives EES the right to match bids to supply gas and electricity to 18 manufacturing sites in Italy and the UK. EES will also assess opportunities for energy management programmes designed to increase energy efficiency at Pirelli's facilities.

Bob Manasse, Vice President Origination of EES Europe, said: ""Congratulations to all those involved for securing EES another great deal which will strengthen our position in Europe and give us a valuable point of entry into the Pirelli tire organization and the recently acquired Telecom Italia.""

German Gas Deal - First Municipality Transaction Signed in BEB Territory 
Congratulations are due to the Frankfurt and London-based gas teams who, in the face of tough competition from the Northern German incumbent supplier, BEB Erdgas and Erdoel (a jointly held Shell and Exxon subsidiary), succeeded in securing two gas supply agreements with the cities of Peine and Uelzen on 24th August. Securing transmission will be challenging due to the fact that BEB has the most onerous grid access terms in Germany. However, the gas team is hopeful these transactions will bring about a turning point in gaining access to customers within BEB's territory, which until Enron closed on these deals was considered to be the ""heart land"" of Germany. 

Enron Names New UK Coal-Hauling Freight Locomotive
On Saturday, 1st September, a ten-strong delegation from Enron's coal team traveled up to British Energy's Eggborough coal-fired power station to take part in the naming ceremony for a newly-acquired Class 66 freight locomotive, recently put into service by Enron business partner and rail freight specialist, Freightliner Heavy Haul.   Enron and Freightliner Heavy Haul signed a contract for UK coal transport in June 2000, effectively breaking the local monopoly in the rail transport of coal held by an incumbent rail freight company.  True to form, the introduction of competition has reduced rates and dramatically improved service levels.

Stuart Staley, Enron's international coal group vice-president, praised the dedication of the Freightliner train drivers and staff who have contributed to the success of the service for Enron. While Eddie Fitzsimons, managing director of Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd noted:  'We only started running coal trains in December 2000 and we have now run more than 17,000 individual wagon journeys containing more than one million tonnes of coal, almost all of that for Enron.'

The coal team selected the name Don Raider from numerous entries received from an earlier Globalflash competition:  ""The new locomotive was named Don Raider, after the river Don, a major river in South Yorkshire where a number of our customers are located,"" explains Tom Kearney, a director in Enron's international coal group who executed the original deal with Freightliner.  ""Other ""Raider Class"" Freightliner Heavy Haul locomotives will be named at a later date, each bearing the name of a river which flows near to coal-fired power stations and major coal-importing ports.""  

While mischievous Enron employees may think the name sounds suspiciously like a covert activity carried out by the new market entrants, we can assure you that would simply be speculation!   Congratulations again to the Coal team on securing this landmark deal.

"NYISO - NOTICE of Changes to OASIS/MIS/CSS Systems","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the public web server (www.nyiso.com), MIS and
SPIDER that will be implemented on July 31, 2001.


The Generation Supplier Issues development project
will be completed with the following functionality
being introduced into the NYISO markets (Please see
published Technical Bulletins for full descriptions):

   Units will be able to operate as Energy Limited
   Resources (ELR). Qualifying units whose schedules
   are modified will not be subjected to any financial
   harm from the obligation to cover energy balancing
   charges.

   Units will be able to operate as Capacity Limited
   Resources (CLR). Bid rules will be modified to allow
   units to indicate an upper MW limit, separate from
   the Upper Operating Limit (UOL), that will be honored
   in the scheduling horizon by SCUC, BME and SCD under
   certain environmental and operating situations.

   Multiple response rates will be allowed. This modification
   is intended to encourage units to be on dispatch by
   allowing units to move in response to price signals. MIS
   will be modified to allow up to three response rate ranges
   to be entered as static data inputs.

   Payment rules for start-up will be modified.

   Payment rules for unforced energy replacement will be
   modified.

Changes to SCUC will be deployed to optimize Phase Angle
Regulators (PARs) for evaluation of the Day Ahead Market (DAM).

The migration of web postings from InfoReports to MrXML will
continue with the replacement of a number of reports with
those generated using the new technology (please note that
the structure of all migrated reports will be retained).




Detailed Release Notices:

MIS:
  KCUG-4YKPTQ;  SMCE-4YKG8J;  BHAN-4XNLTA

Management expects the company to generate $25-$30  million in annualized sales by the end of this calendar  year (2001), and profitable. 4. Recently  Acquired Propamedia, Inc., a streaming media company -  anticipated annual revenues of about $3 million. 5. Profitable  company with strong recurring revenue streams. Total annual  revenues expected to be over $40 million by close of fiscal  2002.     SYMBOL: GTEC SHARES  OUTSTANDING: 23mm FLOAT  (est.): 3mm 52  WEEK HIGH/LOW: .51  - .02 SHORT  TERM PRICE PROJ.: $3.00 12  MONTH PRICE PROJ.: $8.00   [IMAGE]  6.  Biotechnology  subsidiary, Biosystems Technologies Inc., negotiating  exclusive distribution rights for HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis  products in China.  7. The  Company is poised to capitalize on the anticipated economic  explosion from China?s entrance into the World Trade  Organization. 8. New  Interactive Direct Marketing subsidiary, eSpectus Systems,  Inc. entering multibillion dollar direct email market. 9. New  management team with proven track record of business success. 10. Potential  company spin-offs mean shareholders gain stock in additional companies.  [IMAGE]    INVESTMENT  SUMMARY   When we  consider GTEC, we must understand the business model and huge potential  in the Company?s valuation. GTEC develops, invests in, and operates  high technology related companies in the US, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.  GTEC?s strategy includes the internal development and operation of  subsidiaries within the Company's corporate family, as well as investment in other  high technology companies directly, and through other venture capital arrangements.  The Company's strategy also envisions and promotes opportunities for synergistic  business relationships among all of the companies within its family.   We believe  the Company story will get a lot of attention in the investment community in the  coming months, as China joins the WTO. GTEC is a brand-new publicly trading  company via a reverse/merger with Newagecities.com, Inc. (NACT). The Company?s  mission is to accelerate the success of technology companies by acquisition and  development as evidenced by GTEC?s 2 recent acquisitions. GTEC  has been growing at an exciting rate and the foundation has been laid for spectacular  growth in its earnings and sales in the coming quarters. In a world in which ?tech  companies are losing money? lurks around every corner of the market, it?s  refreshing to find a technology company that offers real success for growth in  revenues and earnings.    China's  pending entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will generate  enormous opportunities within the service sector and give impetus  to the country's already robust economic growth. The agreement on  China's WTO entry paves the way for China to join the world trade  body and opens up China's economy to more foreign trade and investment  in sectors ranging from banking and automobiles to telecommunications  and IT services and products.  A recent survey by the Ministry of the Information Industry showed  China's IT industry is robust, in sharp contrast to the slowdown  in the growth of the world's IT industry. Statistics show that the  sales volume of IT products for the past six months has reached  356.1 billion yuan (US$43 billion) nationwide, up 28.3 percent over  the same period for the previous year. Registered Internet users  have exceeded 26 million in the country, an average annual increase  of 25 percent. It is estimated that China will spend one trillion  yuan (US$120 billion) over the next five years to spur its information  industry, according to a meeting of Ministry of Information Industry  held in Beijing on October 6, 2001. China's information industry  is to develop steadily, with its value added accounting for seven  percent of the nation's gross domestic product by the year 2005,  said sources from the ministry. Through 2005, the information industry  will become a major pillar industry of the country. The Chinese  government will make great efforts to push forward and give priority  to the application of information technology as a way of boosting  economic and social development.     Recently,  GTEC?s subsidiary, entered into a distribution agreement  with Intel Corporation (INTC), Cyrix and Advanced Micro Devices,  Inc. (AMD). Under the terms of the agreement, GTEC?s  subsidiary has exclusive distribution rights for Intel CPU and AMD  CPUs in the eastern part of China. GTEC has also been awarded  the exclusive distribution rights for Cyrix's CPU in Shanghai. The  Eastern part of China is believed to have the most dynamic economy  in the greater China marketplace.        VALUATION   A  penny stock with multi-dollar potential: trading today for about  50 cents per share, but in our opinion, has long-term potential  for huge gains. The stock may be one of the year's BIG surprises,  making its current status as an undiscovered stock a rare timing  opportunity for investors. Don't overlook this one! We not  only consider GTEC an attractive ""Emerging Growth Company,""  in our opinion, but also a ""Value Stock"" in view of its  revenues and earnings its current price is about $0.50 per share.  We believe that GTEC has targeted a creative niche in a hot  sector.    One  way to value a company is to look at its peers in the industry.  One public company listed on the OTCBB is pretty much in the same  line of business as GTEC. It is the Hartcourt Companies,  Inc. (OTCBB: HRCT) that has about $43.5 million market cap with  only $10 million in annualized revenues and losing money. Even  if GTEC were to trade at the same market cap as HRCT, GTEC  would then be valued at $1.90 per share. If the stock trades  to its peer?s valuation ratios, such as PE and price to sales  ratios, GTEC should be valued at about $6 per share. HRCT  has a HUGE following on Raging Bull (over 165,000 messages). GTEC  has virtually NONE (slightly over 100 posts). In our opinion  UNDERVALUED AND OVERLOOKED.   The  GTEC acquisition/spin-off schedule in 2002 should add a  considerable number of technology companies. According to management,  this will bring the projected revenue of GTEC by fiscal  2003 to $75 million and net income of $12.4 million or earnings  per share of $0.41 on the basis of 30 million shares outstanding  GTEC intends to acquire other business?s by issuing  restricted stock). If GTEC were to trade in the marketplace  at 15 times earnings, then this would value GTEC at $6.15  per share. If GTEC were to trade in the marketplace at  3 times sales, this would value GTEC at $7.50 per share.  (HRCT trades today at about 4.5 times annualized sales).          SUMMARY   We  believe GTEC is well positioned to take advantage of the  changes in the technology industry. We believe these changes are  still in their earliest stages, affecting primarily the small technology  companies to date. In other words, we believe GTEC is situated  nicely to ride out the slowing domestic economy. In our opinion,  we don't see much downside for GTEC that is traded around  $0.50 per share.

Subject:  Re: Follow Up Material from 9/19 Pricing Issues Task Force
      meeting


Responding to Tim Lynch's comments:

The BME-SCD Operating Reserve Comparison includes the following note:
""Data for BME hours beginning 0:00 was not reliable, assumed all hours were
not short.""

Please explain why data for this hour each day is unreliable and how it
impacts customer bills.  We are troubled that after operating a system for
nearly two years, problems remain that cause this magnitude of inaccuracy.

Tim Lynch
NYSEG Energy Trading
********************

As was explained at the PITF meeting the footnote in question related to a
data transferral problem between the NYISO and LECG that had NO IMPACT on
the BME prices, schedules or any billing matters.

To collate the data for the PITF meeting in a meaningful way it was
necessary to track the state of the 30 minute reserve constraint i.e. was
BME able to purchase sufficient 30 minute reserves to meet the pool 30
minute reserve requirement. LECG's information for the status of the 30
minute reserve constraint for hour beginning 0:00 was unreliable because of
data tranferral and processing problems so we made the very reasonable
assumption that in the middle of the night there is little chance that we
were reserve short. The footnote was entirely reasonable given the context
of the discussion for which the data was prepared.

Thank-you

"ICAP/UCAP  forms","
Dear Market Participant,

In the interest of not flooding the webmaster with constant changes (new
PTIDs or new participant names) to the
UCAP forms (Certification, Bid Forms, and Offer Forms), I will be updating
the forms about once per month.  Since you will
need a methodology to work around missing information, the new forms have
codes that will allow you to enter
undefined PTIDs and undefined new participants.

PTID number 999999 is used for a resource that has not been assigned a
number.
NewLSE is used for a new Load Serving Entity that has not been assigned a
""Registrant Name""
NewSuppl is used for a new Supplier that has not been assigned a
""Registrant Name""

NOTE that if you use any of the above, you must describe your intentions in
the comments cell of the form being submitted.

Other Changes

ISOSu is the prefix for sales or purchases that occurred as a result of
NYISO transactions during the supplemental
process.  The supplemental process is implemented when there is
insufficient UCAP available within a location and
the NYISO must purchase UCAP from outside the location where the shortage
has occurred to meet the NYCA reliability requirements.

PTID numbers to be used when identifying UCAP purchased through the NYISO
auction have been assigned.  The PTID
numbers range from 1 to 38 and are related to auctions or the supplemental
processes.   For example, a participant who is
selling UCAP that was previously purchased in the summer strip auction
would enter PTID number 1 on the Offer form when
selling into a subsequent ISO auction.

A list of PTID numbers is now available on the instruction page of the
auction Offer forms.



Reminder

When identifying an ISO auction, please remember that you must think in
terms of the procurement period for the first auction
month when the transaction took place.  For example, on May 15 (the auction
for the upcoming months of June through October)
3MW were transacted for the months of June and August.  The auction
reference that you will use for both the June and
August transactions are ISOMoJun.  The same auction reference would be used
if on May 15, the transactions were for
August and September.

When completing the Certification Form, do not net transactions.  Lets say
that you are awarded 25 MW from the Strip
Auction and later move (purchase or sell) 5 MW through a bilateral.  Your
entries on the form would show the 25 MW strip
auction transaction on one line and your second line would show the 5 MW
bilateral transaction.  You can not use a
value of 20MW on one line.

Each and Every Month you must submit your certification form.



Regards,
Bob Boyle

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

"Mulligans for Aug 9","
barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



It appears that the NYISO , who has obviously been allotted two HAM mulligans
for each reliability period, used them yesterday for the HB 16,17 Zonal HAM
results.  Cool! I particularly admire the part where they just quietly  left
them out figuring that  you wouldn't  notice 1300,1400.1500, 1800,1900 .

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"The Insider from Travelocity.com","Dear Larry,
Off Season Savings!
What's the best way to save money on your vacation? Book through 
Travelocity. What's the second-best way to save? Book off-season. 
Airlines, hotels, and even cruise lines often lower their rates when 
their peak seasons are over. This means bigger savings and smaller 
crowds for you. Read more about how to plan your trip to take 
advantage of seasonal savings, from Europe to Australia and 
Hawaii--and more. Destination Guides Make Reservations

"Price Reservation for 28 July Real-Time Market","
JSavitt@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Upon a subsequent reexamination of the data, the NYISO has determined that
hour-beginning 7 for the 28 July 2001 real-time market was mistakenly not
reserved.  There might have been a metering problem resulting in the
passing of some incorrect data.  Consequently, the NYISO is now reserving
hour-beginning 7 in the 28 July 2001 real-time market to verify the prices
in that hour.  The hour will be corrected or released as soon as possible.
The NYISO apologizes for the inconvenience, but feels that it must
reexamine that hour more thoroughly and institute corrections if necessary.

"Virtual Bidding - data release","Dear Market Participants:

Methodology used in developing the NYISO Virtual Bidding Credit
Requirements:

Day Ahead Market Hourly Zonal LBMP and Real Time Market Integrated Hourly
Zonal LBMP values were used as the data source for developing the NYISO
Virtual Bidding Credit Requirements.  These values are available on the
NYISO web site.  The time period of June 1, 2001 through August 31, 2001
was used.  Peak hours are defined here as the hours of 6am (06:00) through
and including 10pm (22:00).  The absolute value of the difference of the
DAM and R/T price was calculated for each peak hour.  The 97th percentile
of these series of prices was calculated for each zone.  The maximum of

"Important Message","It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall.  I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.  JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is ""Mission: Possible"" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.  In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer.

Thank you very much for your support.

Subject:	RE: New Football Pool

OK, Updated rules on the pool. Here is how we are going to do it.

Everyone buys 'shares' in any team they want. Each share is $5 apiece. You have to spend a minimum of $20 to get in (let's pump the pool up). This will be done Friday, October 26. The payout formula has changed, however. It is now the following:

Winner of each game in the wildcard round and divisional round gets 5% of the pot.
Winner of each conference championship gets 15% of the pot.
Winner of the Super Bowl gets 30% of the pot.

Since the Super Bowl winner wins earlier games to get to the Super Bowl, they will end up with either 50% or 55%, depending on if they have to play in the wildcard round.

The purpose of this is to establish some sort of value for 2nd tier teams. New Orleans, for example, may not have a chance (in your mind) as the Super Bowl winner, but may get a payoff as a winner of a wildcard game, etc.

1) The pot will be established on Friday October 26. Nothing will be added to it afterwards. The value of each team (as perceived by the market) can change week to week, and by allowing people to 'pick' later, would dilute the earnings, and de-incentivize people to make choices now, when it is riskier.
2) I will make my choice BEFORE any choices are sent to me. DO NOT send any choices to me today. You may start sending them tomorrow, and I will not look at them. I will NOT have prior information about which teams have small pots and which ones have large ones. Obviously, that information could be useful.
3) After all choices have been made (by 4:00 PM Friday), I will send out a summary to everyone listing how much the pot is, which teams are picked and for how much, how many outstanding shares there are. This information is to be used to establish a market for bilateral trades. You may trade with whomever you wish, how ever you wish. You can trade with people outside the pool. THIS IS YOUR OWN RISK.
All you have is a potential cash flow. You may trade those shares and cash for other shares, for cash, etc; you may structure bilateral options, anything you want. But I have NOTHING to do with it, and it does not affect the payout of the pool at the end. Figure your own hedges out. This can be fun.
4) In the unlikely event that a team wins a game(s) and establishes a payout for cash, and no one owns shares in that team (ie - the Cardinals or something), that money will be added to the Super Bowl winners pot. If the Super Bowl is won by a nobody (very unlikely), we will have to establish a strategy for that. I suggest one of 2 options - 1) Go down the list of Super Bowl loser, loser of conference Championship to Super Bowl winner, loser of conference Championship to Super Bowl loser, etc, until we find a winner, or donate the money to charity for disaster relief. It's up to everyone.


So, let me know today that you are interested, but DO NOT send your picks and money selection. That can start tomorrow, but I can't see the choices. Either call or email today, if possible!

Brad

"Enron Blood Drive","Due to the overwhelming response from Enron employees and contractors, today's blood drive appointments are completely full, and there are a large number of you who still wish to donate blood.  We are working diligently with the M. D. Anderson Blood Bank to schedule another day for blood donations, and you will be notified as soon as that date is secured.  For those of you who are interested in giving, please continue to either call the Enron Health Center, ext. 3-6100, to get your name on the waiting list or go to the donation line in front of the building.  We recognize and are grateful to the many of you who are wanting to give blood today, but ask that you be patient and understand our inability to accept walk-in donations at this time.  

Thanks again for the tremendous outpouring of concern.

"Try Ananova.com for much coverage of today's terrorist incidents.","
""Ruben S. Brown"" <rsbrown@ecubedllc.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Subject: Try Ananova.com for much coverage of today's terrorist incidents.

Sorry to impose on this list server, but many of us are involved in today's
events. The following may be helpful and of interest to some of you.

My son Ruben E. Brown, a computer maven at Incert Technology that some of
you know from NYISO meetings this Spring, has steered me to the Ananova.com
website which has high powered servers covering the Terrorist situation with
still relatively few hits. It is constantly feeding AP coverage and is
updated much faster than the conventional US sites.  Times are London times.

"Xcel Energy Inc. to Northern States Power Company","On Aug. 18, 2000, New Century Energies, Inc. and Northern States Power Company (NSP) merged and formed Xcel Energy Inc.  

As part of the merger, NSP transferred its existing utility operations that were being conducted directly by NSP at the parent company level to a newly formed subsidiary of Xcel Energy named Northern States Power Company.

Because of the merger, the record was overlayed in Global Counterparty and all history for Northern States Power Company is now under Xcel Energy.  A new Northern States Power Company record has been created in Global.  I will be moving all Xcel deals with a July 1, 2001 forward flow date to the newly created record for Northern States Power Company.  Xcel Energy will be inactivated in Enpower.  

Please choose Northern States Power Company (NORTHERNST) for future deals with this counterparty.

"August 2001 invoices","The invoices for August 2001 settlements were posted by 10:42 AM today,
Saturday, September 8, 2001.  The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience
resulting in posting these invoices a day after they were scheduled.  The
Customer Settlements group makes every effort to render accurate invoices
on a timely basis.  Although issued a day after their scheduled posting,
the invoices are still being issued within the 5-business days.  {I'd
forgotten about Labor Day when I set up the schedule.}

Transmission Customers will observe adjustments for an error on in May 2000
Settlement  Adjustment  invoices  that  were  issued  in  July.   The total
adjustment  amounted to $2,081,568.11 and was allocated across 2,261,753.08
MWh.   Customers  may  validate  their  respective adjustments by computing
their  ratio  shares  of  the  $2,081,568.11  using  2,261,753  MWh  as the
denominator  in  their respective ratios of their May 2000 load. The reason
the  denominator of the ratio share appears small is because the pay out of
this  adjustment is to the Transmission Owners.  In order not to assess the
TO's  a  proportionate  share  of the $2,081,568.11, which would defeat the
purpose  of  the  adjustment, their withdrawals have been excluded from the
ratio share.  Transmission Owners should observe a credit on their invoices
based upon their respective megawatt-mile coefficients for the period.

With  regard  to  the  November 1999 & December 1999 settlement adjustments
that  were  scheduled  to  be issued on the 7th, the NYISO intends to issue
those  invoices  next  week.  The issuance dates will ensure that customers
will have at least 5 business days to review the invoices prior to payments
being due to the NYISO.  If necessary, the NYISO will reschedule settlement
dates  for these months should our reconciliations take longer to complete;
however, we do not anticipate this at this time.

In  addition,  I'd  like to take this opportunity to clarify a point that I
made  in  a  TIE  posting  regarding  the  rebilling  of  the  August  25th
settlements.   The  initial  billing runs for August 25th were done without
considering  ConEd's  sub-zonal  load.   As a result, it appeared as though
there  was no load in the ConEd sub-zones on the 25th and all DAM purchases
and  bilateral transactions in those sub-zones were sold back to the market
in  real  time  causing  the  Schedule  1 residual adjustment to be grossly
inflated.   The reason this occurred was due to what appears to have been a
frame  relay  problem  between the NYISO & ConEd resulting in the NYISO not
receiving a file from ConEd.  By no means was my email notification of this
event  to  imply that ConEd was not complying with the daily load provision
process.  This was merely a hardware/communications issue.

Randy A. Bowers

"RE: WGR Responsibility for Gomez facility.","Charlie - yes the operating agreement from the summer of 1995 does require WGR to conduct all env activity.  My guess is that there was an oversight but also that the TNRCC won't make an issue out of this.  

Charlie (childs) - let us know what comes up.  thx

Subject:	RE: WGR Responsibility for Gomez facility.

I received a call from WGR (Bruce Ports 303-450-8401) on Tuesday 12/18.  Seems no permits were filed for the Gomez, Oates or Pikes Peak treaters (which were not running) during the period WGR was operating the plant for us.  WGR did file title V paperwork and paid fees for the Gomez compression that was operating.  Probably no harm since the plants weren't running, but may be a technical violation.  Bruce asked me for some history of operation which I gave him verbally [i.e. Intratex (an Enron affiliate) operated for NNG prior to WGR].  One point I stressed, was that we believed the operating agreement obligated WGR to file any required environmental permits (with or without NNG reminding them) and that NNG was deliberate in not performing duties that WGR was paid to perform.

Subject:	WGR Responsibility for Gomez facility.

Guys, with respect to the above, as you know, WGR was responsible for all compliance submittals during the time that we owned and they operated.  I know in the past, prior to their taking over ownership, I would remind them each year that a particular document was requried.  I figured that when they became owners, they didnt need me anymore.  Louie, you are right, Phil Moyer was the environmental contact for WGR and he was the one I would contact and apprise.  It just so happens that I have copies of previous annual submittals from WGR for the Gomez facility  when the facility was under our ownership, their responsibility.  I even have a copy of the Title V Permit.  When I was told that we no longer owned the faclity, I sent all information I had to WGR, but kept copies of the stuff I had, just in case.  I can send it one more time if you want me too.  Let me know.....

"Emission Fees","Please respond to Larry,

I spoke with Darron Blackburn regarding the Burger, Crane, and Sonora
accounts.  Darron has told me that the blue fee return sheets indicate that
EOTT submitted zero fees for these three accounts.  Darron indicated that
these sites had either NSPS sources or an active Title V permit.  Therefore,
fees would be required.  A fee would not be required if there was no
intention of operating the sites in the 2002 fiscal year (September 1, 2001
through August 31, 2002).

1. If a fee is owed but the site did not operate in 2000, then EOTT would
owe the minimum fee - $26.
2. If the Title V was not officially terminated prior to Nov.1, then the fee
is required if the source operates in the fiscal year.

Our database shows Burger and Sonora to be out of service.  Therefore, a
2002 fiscal year fee would not be required.  This needs to be communicated
to Mr. Blackburn in writing.  Our database shows Crane to have all
grandfathered tanks.  Therefore, the only trigger for a fee would be an
active Title V permit.  Do you know if the TNRCC has voided the Title V and
if so when?

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

	     KEY  FEATURES     Unrisked future net revenue of  $2.42 Billion from Utah properties alone    $14.80 / share price target  forecast by Canaccord Capital    Important strategic  partnerships with Phillips Petroleum, Halliburton Co. and  Burlington Resources    Named one of Colorado's 100  Fastest Growing Companies by Denver Business Journal     Strong management team led by  an established team of oil & gas leaders        [IMAGE]   Leading Petroleum Engineering firm  reports GASCO ENERGY's unrisked future net revenues of $2.4  billion from Utah wells alone. Analyst forecasts $14.80/share  price target!  Gasco Energy Inc. is an  oil & gas company whose natural gas properties could potentially  begin producing in the billion-dollar range, but is still trading  under $3 per share!    [IMAGE]Recently, Gasco Energy's (OTCBB: GASE)  properties and future revenues in Utah were independently evaluated  and estimated by Netherland, Sewell & Associates (NSAI) - a  40-year-old international petroleum consulting firm. NSAI (www.netherlandsewell.com ) has worked with hundreds  of top financial institutions from Bank of America to Credit Suisse  as well as major oil and gas companies from Exxon to Shell.    The report states that  the estimated unrisked future net revenue on GASE's interest will  most likely produce $2.42 BILLION!! Please note that the report  discusses NET revenues, which are calculated by deducting state  production and ad valorem taxes, operating expenses and ALL future  capital costs from the gross revenues. While these are net revenues,  as opposed to net income, this can mean great news for GASE's  existing and future shareholders!    In evaluating  probabilities of occurrence, NSAI's report states ""there is very  little risk of not encountering gas in this basin-centered gas  accumulation"". In fact according to NSAI, the property's most likely  present worth is $242 million discounted at 10% based on average  NYMEX prices for the period 09/00 to 08/02. Wellhead prices used in  the report are $3.56 per MMBtu, escalated 3% per year to a maximum  of $4.15 per MMBtu.    Foremost among GASE's  strategic partnerships is GASE's agreement with Phillips Petroleum  (NYSE:P). GASE and Phillips have been working to maximize  shareholder value on the Utah properties. GASE has also teamed with  Halliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL) to potentially drill and complete up to  10 wells within the same area.    IN ADDITION to the  interest in Utah properties, GASE also recently reported that it has  teamed up with Burlington Resources (NYSE: BR) - one of the world's  largest independent oil and gas companies - to explore and develop a  series of natural gas plays in Wyoming. This significantly enlarges  GASE's land mass, which may further increase the company's net  present worth!!    According to the U. S.  Geological Survey, the Greater Green River Basin has produced more  than 7.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 849 million barrels  of oil, making it one of the country's truly significant oil and gas  fields. Burlington Resources is the perfect partner to help develop  the many highly fractured, tight-gas-sands prospects the companies  expect to find there.    OPPORTUNITY: Based on GASE's recoverable resources,  property's present worth and industry partnerships London based  Canaccord Capital recently issued an Investment report estimating  the value of Gasco's licenses to be $740 Million, or $14.80 per  share.    Despite all the recent  developments, the company's stock is still trading below $3. Many  consider this to be ridiculously low, considering that NSAI  estimates future net revenues of up to $2.4 billion and unrisked  present worth at $242 million. With its high probability Utah stake  AND its Wyoming partnership with Burlington, GASE is now diversified  AND showing huge growth potential!    BILLION DOLLAR  QUESTION: How quickly will GASE's stock price start to  reflect its real value? As the company is still trading on the  OTCBB, maybe it hasn't been able to attract institutional investors  who price stocks based on their real value. When they learn about  the recent developments, GASE's valuation could potentially change  overnight!    URGENT! With an  application for listing pending and the type of assets GASE  possesses, it may be only a matter of time before the company jumps  to Amex. That would open a lot of doors for GASE and potentially  explode the demand for GASE stock and lead to a much higher  valuation! What will GASE be trading at by then?

"Re: A response on today's horrid event from a Canadian","a poodle is a poodle indeed!  the displays of patriotism are just peoples'
way of showing support, pride, and love of one's country.  hell, my 72 yrs
old papa wanted to do the candle thing...then line up 50 terrorist and
shooting them in the heads!  he said he would love to be able to help fight
the afghans!  just bc you wanna show or display symbols of patriotism,
doesn't mean that's the ONLY thing you're willing to do.  not just anyone is
gonna be allowed to help search for missing victims...only certain ones are
allowed.  others can only show their support by donating $$$ for the families
of survivors and rescue workers (mark cuban gave a million bucks), donating
supplies & blood.  people here were waiting up to 8 hrs just to donate
blood....sheit, that means something in my book.  sure, we're fat and happy
about an extended time of peace and prosperity....but i think the fat cat can
still swing the bat.  just give it some time my european canine...give the
texan a chance to lead and the people a chance to follow.  after all, that
dude leading us be from the RIGHT side of POLITIX

"United Way Day of Caring","


EWS has been asked to sponsor the Center for the Retarded, for this year's Days of Caring.  We need your help to make this effort a success.  

What are the Days of Caring?

United Way Days of Caring began in 1992 with 800 volunteers from area corporations.  The Days of Caring for the year 2000 grew to over 7,000 participants from the Houston area.  During the annual Days of Caring, volunteers put their caring into action by working at agency locations.  Donors are able to see for themselves the work done by the agencies, meet those who are served and learn more about how their investment in the United Way impacts our community.

What agency are we sponsoring?

The Center - Serving Persons with Mental Retardation   

*	 Serving Bay Area and Fort Bend, Harris, Montgomery and Waller Counties  
*	 Provides opportunities for persons with mental retardation to maximize their potential for independence.   
*	 Services include: adult activity centers, education, community living options, employment and health services.   
*	 For more information, visit the website at: www.cri-usa.org <http://www.cri-usa.org> 

How long will I be away from the office? 

You have 2 shifts to choose from.  We will provide your transportation to and from the location.    

The morning shift will start at 8:15 a.m., Friday August 10th, with a kick-off from the Office of the Chair.  The bus will then leave at 8:30 a.m. and will drop you in front of The Center.    The bus will return you to Enron by 11:30 a.m. where you can grab your complimentary sack lunch from Chick-Fil-a. 

The afternoon shift will begin at 1:00 p.m. and last until 4:00 p.m.   

The Body Shop has been generous enough to let us use its shower facility for anyone who chooses an outdoor activity.

What will I need to do?

You have the option to sign up for a variety of activities.  These activities include Landscaping, Heavy Cleaning, Light Construction, Painting, Arts & Crafts, Playing Bingo, and Hosting a Party (providing baked goods, punch, and snacks).

Will I need to bring any equipment / supplies?

Depending on the activity you choose, you may be asked to provide equipment / supplies.  The necessity for supplies may range from construction paper and scissors to rakes, brooms, and gloves.  Your Business Unit representative will follow-up with more details.

Contest Information -

For everyone in EWS who participates in the Days of Caring, your name will be entered into a drawing  to win 1 of 5 American Express Gift Certificates. 

As I stated earlier, WE NEED YOU TO MAKE THIS EVENT A SUCCESS. 

      

How do I volunteer?

Contact your EWS Days of Caring Committee Members -

Cheryl Lindeman      5-2849                 Tom Myers    3-0475             Tammie Schoppe    3-4220            Marcus Edmonds    3-4243

"Dynegy Discussions","
Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

"2001 Safety Calendar - CORRECTION","For those that use and rely upon the ETS Safety Connection Calendar, please be aware there is a discrepancy in December. The December calendar states the 25th and 26th are Enron holidays. It should state the 24th and 25th. 

Please refer to http://hrweb.enron.com/infozone/holidayCalender/Default.asp for any calendar concerns.

I apologize for any confusion this may have generated.

"Re: Follow Up Material from 9/19 Pricing Issues Task Force meeting","
tjlynch@nyseg.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:


The BME-SCD Operating Reserve Comparison includes the following note:
""Data for BME hours beginning 0:00 was not reliable, assumed all hours were
not short.""

Please explain why data for this hour each day is unreliable and how it
impacts customer bills.  We are troubled that after operating a system for
nearly two years, problems remain that cause this magnitude of inaccuracy.

DCongel@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants:

This is a message that will be posted each month as a request from market
participants who attended the last Billing & Accounting Workshop.  The
suggestion
was to have a simple statement posted to the web letting each customer know
that
the last version for each billing day of the month has been posted.  In the
future this
will simply be ""The latest versions of advisory statements have been posted
to each
customer's web site for the billing month of mmm/yyyy.""

If you have any questions please contact customer relations at

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"CHANGE TO THE ADVISORY STATEMENTS BEGINNING 8/15/2001","On 8/15/2001 Market Participants will have (2) new billing codes in their
advisory statements.

(1)  Code 238, which currently exists in the hrly advisory statement, but
up until now it has been null.  Code 238 will now be 'Hrly LRR DAM Contract
Bal Pmnt $'.  This will reflect dollars paid to a generator for DAM
Contract Balancing that is Out-of-Merit for LRR.  Code 239 will reflect
dollars paid to a generator for DAM Contract Balancing and is not
Out-of-Merit for LRR.  The sum (238+239)=313, and 313 can be found under
the ""Power Supplier"" section of the daily advisory statement.

(2)  Code 314, this is a new addition that did not exist on the daily csv
file before.  Code 314 is 'ELR DAM Contract Balancing Payment $'.  There is
not an
hrly code for ELR DAM Contract Balancing because it is a daily settlement,
not an hrly settlement.

The funds that will be collected from the LSE's to pay for Code 313, and
Code 314 will be collected through the residual adjustment codes 611 (hrly)
and 813 (daily).

Version 14 of the data dictionary will reflect these new billing codes, and
this will be found on the NYISO website under Grid Accounting &
Settlements, just like the previous versions.

A new billing code mapping will also be available, and will be version 7,
and can also be found under the Grid Accounting & Settlements section on
the NYISO website.

"Meeting and Event Expenditure","
The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.
3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form.
4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

"Today's Events","The Enron Building in Houston will be closed for the rest of the day.  The offices in New York and Washington, D.C. have also been closed, and all employees have been accounted for.  We're asking all Houston-based employees not involved in critical operations to go home to be with their families.  We have every reason to believe the Enron Building is safe and secure.  Each Enron location has the discretion to determine what is in the best interest of their employees.  We know of no Enron employee or facility affected by today's tragic events.  Let's keep all the victims of these tragedies in our thoughts and prayers.  

If you have information that you believe may be relevant to this matter, please email john.brindle@enron.com <mailto:john.brindle@enron.com>.  For updates, view http://www.enron.com/corp/usbombingcrisisupdate.

"GADS Data and Equivalent GADS Data Reporting","
JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

All ICAP Suppliers submitting GADS Data and/or Equivalent GADS Data should
clearly distinguish GADS Data  from Equivalent GADS Data submissions.
Please identify the data as GADS Data or Equivalent GADS Data and do not
intermingle the two data forms in any data file.  Attachment K of the NYISO
ICAP Manual clearly defines the data requirements for each data type and
Attachment J of the NYISO ICAP Manual explains how UCAP (Unforced Capacity)

"Code of Ethics -- What Exactly Did I Agree To?","

How well do you know our Code of Ethics?

""It is a condition of employment that each employee accept the responsibility of complying with the foregoing policies.  The Company will require each employee of the Company to complete and submit a statement in a form designated by the Company pertaining to such employee's compliance with the policies set forth in this booklet.  The Company reserves the right to request any employee to complete and submit such statement at any time or as frequently as the Company may deem advisable.""
(Enron Code of Ethics, July 2000, page 62)

What does that mean?

In layman's terms, everyone employed by Enron agrees to all the policies and standards listed in the current Code of Ethics (July 2000).

Who does it apply to?

The Code of Ethics applies to all employees, third party contractors, guests and licensees of Enron.  Additionally, employees are responsible for their family members and/or personal household who use, own, or have access to Enron's communication services and equipment -- including telephones, fax machines, computers, computer modems, long distance telephone services, cell phones, voice mail, pagers, e-mail, mail and delivery services.

What about my privacy?

Don't expect privacy when using Enron's equipment or services -- whether the activity is business or non-business related.  For example, don't use Enron's equipment to send or receive personal messages that you don't want monitored or accessed by the government, third parties or Enron.  In a nutshell, if you want privacy, don't use Enron's equipment.

Are there repercussions for non-compliance?

Yes.  An employee who violates any of the policies in the Code of Ethics is subject to disciplinary action, including suspension or termination of employment, and can include legal action if Enron believes it to be appropriate under the circumstances.


If you have any questions or comments about IT security or a related issue, please feel free to put them into eMeet (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf) under the ""IT Security"" category.  We'll monitor the site and respond to you there.

   This poem was written by a terminally ill young girl in a New York
   Hospital. It was sent by a medical doctor - Make sure to read what is
   in the closing statement AFTER THE POEM.

   SLOW DANCE
   Have you ever watched kids
   On a merry-go-round?
   Or listened to the rain
   Slapping on the ground?
   Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight?
   Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?
   You better slow down.
   Don't dance so fast.
   Time is short.
   The music won't last.


   Do you run through each day
   On the fly?
   When you ask ""How are you?""
   Do you hear the reply?
   When the day is done
   Do you lie in your bed
   With the next hundred chores
   Running through your head?
   You'd better slow down
   Don't dance so fast.
   Time is short.
   The music won't last.


   Ever told your child,
   We'll do it tomorrow?
   And in your haste,
   Not see his sorrow?
   Ever lost touch,
   Let a good friendship die
   Cause you never had time
   To call and say,""hi""
   You'd better slow down.
   Don't dance so fast.
   Time is short.
   The music won't last.


   When you run so fast to get somewhere
   You miss half the fun of getting there.
   When you worry and hurry through your day,
   It is like an unopened gift....
   Thrown away.
   Life is not a race.
   Do take it slower
   Hear the music
   Before the song is over.


   PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO HELP THIS LITTLE GIRL.
   ALL FORWARDED E-MAILS ARE TRACKED TO OBTAIN THE TOTAL COUNT.


   Dear All:
   PLEASE pass this mail on to everybody you know. It is the request of
   a special little girl who will soon leave this world as she has
   cancer. Please send this to everyone you know or don't know. This
   little girl has 6 months left to live, and as her dying wish, she
   wanted to send a letter telling everyone to live their life to the
   fullest, since she never will. She'll never make it to prom, graduate
   from high school, or get married and have a family of her own. By you
   sending this to as many people as possible, you can give her and her
   family a little hope, because with every name that this is sent to,
   The American Cancer Society will donate 3 cents per name to her
   treatment and recovery plan. One guy sent this to 500 people! So I
   know that we can send it to at least 5 or 6. Just think it could be
   you one day. It's not even your money, just your time! PLEASE PASS ON
   AS A LAST REQUEST


   Dr. Dennis Shields, Professor
   Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology
   1300 Morris Park Avenue
   Bronx, New York 10461

"Friday County Commission - Redistricting Meeting","I am forwarding a message from Rod Adair. It is my understanding that Rod
drew ALL the plans and does not back any of them, as he can't, considering
his role in this process. That makes sense. Rod drew plan G which is the
plan Frank Sanchez (a Democrat) directed him to draw. I am still in favor of
Plan C, which puts the districts up for grabs to either Democrat or
Republican. That is the way these districts should be drawn. It should not
be a safe seat for either side.

The Commission will also vote for the Chairman. Some are indicating that
they will vote for Eloy Ortega, who is a Democrat. We have 4 County
Commissioners who are Republican and 1 who is a Democrat. Why should any of
our commissioners vote for a Democrat to be Chairman?
The executive board of the Republican Party passed a resolution last Friday
that we resolve, as officers of the Republican Party, to encourage
Republicans who are elected to serve in public office to promte fellow
Republicans to positions of leadership and authority at each and every
opportunity.

As fellow Republicans in Chaves County we need to call and let our
Republican County Commissioners know they should elect a REPUBLICAN to serve
as chairman and leader of that board.

> >I'm forwarding this in regards to the County Commission meeting on
Friday...I have talked to Rod Adair in the past about how he draws a
district. The way he draws districts is fair for both sides. It makes a
district available to a Democrat, as well as, a Republican and may the
hardest worker win. This whole notion of ""majority minority"" districts is
offensive because it indicates that minoirities don't think for themselves
and vote for the candidate or the party of their choice, they instead vote
in a block. That means Democrats want minorities in a block because in their
mind they do now and will always vote Democrat. If that is true, they are
drawing lines in favor of themselves and don't forget, Frank Sanchez is a
Democrat. Rod's plan is fair for both sides. I'm backing HIS plan. I'm
planning on being there.

"Tragedy Claims Life of Enron Employee","As most of you know, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York.  We are very sorry to report that we believe an Enron employee was on board that flight.   Nick Humber, a director in Enron Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.  Nick was based in Boston and was traveling to Los Angeles for a meeting.  We have talked with Nick's family and offered our full support.  Please continue to keep Nick's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers.

"NYISO - Software release - October 16, 2001 [and update for September 25, 2001]","
FCiani@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

Software changes originally scheduled for September 25, 2001 have been
delayed.  Quality Assurance testing discovered problems which need to be
repaired and retested.

The deployment of BEA's WebLogic application server will be delayed until
October 16, 2001. This server will be the platform utilized by the MIS to
provide bidding and scheduling functions.  It will replace the current
NetDynamics product and will be a more robust and reliable development
platform for future enhancements.

New data postings will be available on the web to provide real-time
internal
transmission limits and flows.  Transmission line scheduled and actual
outages
will also be posted.  These postings are a continuation of the data
requests
made by the Business Issues Committee (BIC) in September 2000.


If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

"RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel","RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:  Re: Follow Up Material from 9/19 Pricing Issues Task Force
      meeting


Responding to Tim Lynch's comments:

The BME-SCD Operating Reserve Comparison includes the following note:
""Data for BME hours beginning 0:00 was not reliable, assumed all hours were
not short.""

Please explain why data for this hour each day is unreliable and how it
impacts customer bills.  We are troubled that after operating a system for
nearly two years, problems remain that cause this magnitude of inaccuracy.

Tim Lynch
NYSEG Energy Trading
********************

As was explained at the PITF meeting the footnote in question related to a
data transferral problem between the NYISO and LECG that had NO IMPACT on
the BME prices, schedules or any billing matters.

To collate the data for the PITF meeting in a meaningful way it was
necessary to track the state of the 30 minute reserve constraint i.e. was
BME able to purchase sufficient 30 minute reserves to meet the pool 30
minute reserve requirement. LECG's information for the status of the 30
minute reserve constraint for hour beginning 0:00 was unreliable because of
data tranferral and processing problems so we made the very reasonable
assumption that in the middle of the night there is little chance that we
were reserve short. The footnote was entirely reasonable given the context
of the discussion for which the data was prepared.

Thank-you
Andrew Hartshorn

HE 13 EDT - Original deal made for 50 MW @ $82.20 - Hourly P&L notes deal was cut at 12:15 and therefore only 13 MW flowed as confirmed by PJM data - Tag review indicates flow started at 12:15 and ended at HE 13  (38 MW flow) - Settlements is requesting this be revised back to 50MW @ $60/MW - I need input from you regarding this deal to determine the action required.  Please provide any helpful info you have as soon as possible.

HE 10 EDT - Just an FYI that the purchase price was changed to $41/MW from $42 at the request of Exelon to our Settlements group.  I went ahead and changed it due to the low value and because it is in our favor.  If you disagree with this or have any questions, please let me know.

"Teesside Update","
Dear Enron Employees:

I'm sorry to report that a third Enron employee has died in the hospital as a result of injuries from yesterday's explosion and fire at Teesside Power Station.  To lose another employee is a devastating blow to all of us.  A fourth employee remains in the hospital and is in stable condition.  Please keep these employees and their families in your thoughts and prayers.  We will release their names as soon as all family members and relatives have been notified.

I'm in the U.K. now and will be visiting with the employees and families who've been affected by this tragic accident.  I will also visit the site and will meet with authorities in order to determine the cause of the explosion.  I will keep you posted on any new developments.

"results of football pool","Hello everyone, 

	It was a tough week overall this week with several games going down as upsets. College games were overall better than the pros this week. No one correctly picked the Clemson victory over Georgia Tech. Also no one picked New England over Indy, Cleveland over Jacksonville or Baltimore over Denver. We have a 3 way tie heading into the Monday night game tonight, with 
Rick Broussard, Rob Benson and Todd DeCook still alive, all with 5 incorrect picks. Rick picked San Francisco tonight with 37 total points scored, Rob picked San Fran with 41 points and Todd picked the Jets with 52 total points. Therefore, it will first come down to who wins the game tonight, as if the Jets win, Todd will win it outright. If the 49ers win, then it will come down to total points. If there is 40 or more points scored, Rob will win, 38 or less, Rick will win, 39 there will be a tie. We had 28 entries this week, therefore the prize is $56. The following is who played this week with total incorrect picks next to each person's name.

"A response on today's horrid event from a Canadian","This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.

America: The Good Neighbor.

Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable
editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television
commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as
printed in the Congressional Record:

""This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most
generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.

Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of
the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and
forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying
even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.

When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who
propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.

When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries in
to help. This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes.
Nobody helped.

The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars! into
discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about
the decadent, warmongering Americans.

I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the
erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane. Does any other
country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the
Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why
do all the International lines except Russia fly American Planes?

Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the
moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios. You talk
about German technocracy, and you get automobiles.

You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon -! not
once, but several times - and safely home again.

You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store
window for everybody to look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued
and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are
breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home
to spend here.

When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through
age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad
and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both
are still broke.

I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other
people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to
the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during
the San Francisco earthquake.

Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired
of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing with
their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at
the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is
not one of those.""

Stand proud, America!

This is one of the best editorials that I have ever read regarding the
United States. It is nice that one man realizes it. I only wish that the
rest of the world would realize it. We are always blamed for everything, and
never even get a thank you for the things we do.

I would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as you can
and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends until
this letter is sent to every person on the web. I am just a single American
that has read this.

"SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE","As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

Dear Market Participants:

Due to today's unfortunate incidents in New York City and the rest of the
country and the resulting high level of internet traffic, some Market
Participants have reported problems submitting their bids and seeing their
schedules over the internet. This is not a problem with the NYISO markets,
which are functioning normally.  If you experience any communication
problems, we encourage you to contact your NYISO customer account
representative or the NYISO Customer Relations help desk line at (518)
356-6060. If necessary, someone in Customer Relations can help you input
your bids or relay your schedule information to you.

Sincerely,

Kathy Whitaker
Customer Relations

The NYISO has successfully migrated its billing system to a new server.
Re-billings for July 1st - 16th, 2001 were rerun and posted over the
weekend.  In addition to the July 2001 re-billings, the NYISO also ran and
posted the advisory billing statements for the July 2000 settlement
adjustment.  Invoices for the July 2000 settlement adjustment and July 2001
initial billing are scheduled to be issued on August 7, 2001.  Customers
are advised to resume their reviews of advisory billing statements and
report anomalies to their Customer Relations Representatives.  The NYISO

"Organization Changes","Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

"July 16 2001 Advisory Statements","
DCongel@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Market Participants:

In the early evening hours on 8/8/2001 the NYISO inadvertently ran a
billing job for
7/16/2001.  This created a version 5 of the bills for this billing date.
Version 5 is not
valid, all customers should use version 4 when reconciling their advisory
statements
to their invoice.

If you have any questions please contact Customer Relations at
518-356-6060.

"8/9/01 mulligans","
barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



It appears that the NYISO , who has obviously been allotted two HAM mulligans
for each reliability period, used them yesterday for the HB 16,17 Zonal HAM
results.  Cool! I particularly admire the part where they just quietly  left
them out figuring that  you wouldn't  notice 1300,1400.1500, 1800,1900 .

resent after 1/2 hr delay if you get this twice

"FW: FERC Meeting on November 7","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Nicolay, Christi L.  
Sent:	Monday, November 05, 2001 9:00 AM
To:	Black, Tamara Jae; Harvey, Claudette
Subject:	FW: FERC Meeting on November 7

TJ and Claude-please send to your groups. thanks.

 

FERC's meeting scheduled for Wednesday, November 7, does not have any RTO dockets on the agenda.  The generic docket ""Electricity Market Design and Structure,"" which is the docket FERC is using for its ""RTO Week"" proceeding, is included on the agenda, but we do not expect any significant actions in this docket because FERC is still taking comments from the industry on the outcome of RTO Week.  However, this new Commission has surprised us before, so if anything of import happens at next week's meeting, we'll notify you immediately. 

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Sarah

"Collateral calculation for the Virtual Transactions Market","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:


COLLATERAL CALCULATION FOR APPLICANTS FOR THE VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS MARKET:

The largest price delta observed at the 97th percentile level during June,
July, and August, 2001, was $159.33. This
amount  should be rounded to the nearest dollar amount ($159.00) when used
in the collateral calculation process..

The collateral formula is as follow:

The price delta of $159.00 is multiplied by the exposure calculation factor
of 14 ($159.00 x 14 = $2,226.00).  This equals the dollar amount of
collateral required per mega watt hour (MWH).  The $2,226.00 is then
multiplied by the maximum number of MWH's the Market Participant may wish
to bid on a daily basis.  The Market Participant notifies the NYISO of the
maximum number of MWH's they  may wish to bid  per day by completing,
executing and returning the  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF
UNDERSTANDING OF NYISO FINANCIAL ASSURANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR
VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS.  This document is attached to Addendum A of the NYISO
Registration Packet dated August 28, 2001.(refer to Page A6 of the Addendum
A).  The NYISO Registration Packet is located on the NYISO web site at:

http://www.nyiso.com/services/relations/cregistration/pdf/nyiso_reg.pdf

The example used in Addendum A stated the Market Participant wished to bid
up to a maximum of 1600 MWH's per day.

In this example, the collateral required would be $2,226.00 x 1600.
Consequently, the collateral requirement to bid up to a maximum of 1600
MWH's per day in the Virtual Transactions Market would be $3,561,600.

Please contact NYISO Customer Relations if you have any questions.

Please click on the arrow to the left of the title to expand the section.  Thank you.

            October 2001                                                                                                                                                                    Volume 2, Number 10	



In an effort to reduce our speed to market, improve client satisfaction, and streamline the account setup process, we have made several changes to the process:

The Work Initiation Process will no longer be used to process new deals.
The Deal Sheet has been replaced with a new form, the Deal Ticket.  The Deal Ticket consists of a one-page data entry form and a data sheet that can be uploaded.  Enron owns the Deal Ticket and is responsible for revisions and updates.  A sample Deal Ticket is contained in the attached file.
Deal Tickets will be transferred from Enron to CSC's Order Provisioning team via the share drive (Enron's I: drive and CSC's L: drive).
This new process went into effect for Gas Mid Market deals on October 8.
The new process went into effect for Enron Direct on October 22.
Power Mid Market deals will launch in the coming weeks.
CSC will report the status of all deals in process to Enron.
All deals originally submitted through the Work Initiation Process will be stored there, and changes to those deals will continue to be process through that tool.

If you have any questions about the new Deal Setup Process, please call Tom Huson, Team Enron, at 713.345.5054.

The Business Center is the central point in EES for dealing with customer issues.  Given that role, the management and staff of CSC's Customer Call Center have established procedures to handle calls that come into the Business Center but require resolution by  CSC.  A ""hot"" hand-off procedure ensures that customers speak to the person who can resolve their question while still on the phone.  Together, the two groups are working hard to respond to customer inquires and problems in an ongoing effort to achieve
the highest level of customer satisfaction.




Two CSC teams were called to action as a result of the September 11th terrorists attack in New York.  On the morning of the attacks, approximately 40 CSC employees were at work at St. Vincent Catholic Medical Center, the closest hospital to New York's financial district.  CSC has an IT outsourcing contract with the medical center.  After the attack, CSC employees helped to set up an expanded receiving area for ambulances and emergency vehicle, transfer patients to the emergency room, and restock
emergency vehicles returning to the World Trade Center area with towels, sheets, saline solution, and masks.  They also helped to set up additional nurses' stations and round up stretchers and wheelchairs from throughout the facility.  By Wednesday, the team moved onto other roles by helping to setup and man telephone lines and collect patient information in an ad hoc database.  Some also volunteered at the information center that was setup for family and friends in search of information about their loved ones.

The Pinnacle Alliance team supports the J. P. Morgan Chase (JPMC) data centers.  Twenty CSC employees worked 24-hour shifts at the data centers located at 60 Wall Street using backup generators for power to maintain servers and telecommunications for JPMC's equities and markets business.  The team was able to access the impact and stabilize the technology infrastructure for the client's continued operation.  JPMC was one of the first financial firms to complete New York Stock Exchange testing over the
weekend of September 15.  On September 17, JPMC had its largest single day of trading without incident.

BKranz@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Jim,

Thank you for providing your suggestions for proceeding with the assessment
of BME/RT pricing issues assigned to the S&P working group by the BIC
Chairperson at the MC last week.  The compilation and review of data that
you have proposed would take some time and coordination from staff in
several departments including Operations.  Due to the conditions we are
experiencing this week, we will be unable to provide this data in time for
the next S&P meeting.  Because of this, I would propose that we post this
list with the meeting materials for the 20th and that we will provide as
much information on our assessment of the issue as we can at this meeting.

scheije@selectenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

I apologize for the larger circulation of this email than to just the S&P
WG.

The MC last week urged a rapid consideration of the interactions between
BME and SCD and their related prices from the hot, high load days of July
24 and 25.

To pursue this there is additional information needed from the ISO. Below
is a preliminary list I compiled that would be useful in assessing the
situation.

Data should be provided for relevant hours i.e. those with high BME or RT
prices or both. Particularly for those hours with binding reserve
constraints in HA or RT.

1 RT reserve levels in each hour (it is recognized that the value
fluctuates but the the point is to get an idea of apporximately how short
the ISO was of reserves, if at all)

2 Similar information should be obtained for our neighbors; PJM, NE and
IMO. Also, could the ISO describe what the others do hour ahead to prepare
for the next operating hour under circumstances such as we encountered
those two days? NY has the unfortunate position of producing prices related
to decisions for which it pays otherwise - what were our neighbors doing?

3 An accounting, by hour, of reserves carried on exports out of NY

4 Identification of any non-ICAP based exports that may have been counted
for reserve; this shouldn't happen as it puts non-ICAP providers in the
position of being recalled...

5 BME reserve deficiencies by hour; were the reserve levels always met,
albeit at extreme prices, or was the ISO unable to cover the requirements
in advance?

6 Based on Mike Calimano's report, there were ""a couple hundred Mws"" of
operating units not seen by BME; this situation needs to be (1) confirmed
and (2) explained and corrected

The following are sort of 2nd tier questions:

1 If the ISO was short of reserves in RT why weren't the EDRP resources,
who were notified, not called into play to aid in curing the deficiency?
There should have been no economic judgement call by operators (if the
first two hours were at $500 that was likely cheaper than what BME was
taking in if the BME prices applied to settlement under ECA B). BME made no
judgement call when its prices spiked due to the 30 M NSR scarcity and took
available imports.

2 What would have been the System State(s) if the reserve margins had been
held in RT (assuming ISO was short in RT)? Would this have forced a Major
Emergency and subsequent voltage reductions, public appeals etc? Had this
been done would have the EDRP Mws been activated?

I would also like to offer the following as potential changes to be
considered. They are based on the limited discussions that have taken place
so far.

1 Include exports that are being counted as reserve in BME as it evaluates
its reserve position. Since BME is deciding which transactions will be
scheduled, operators would need to indicate which transactions and how many
Mws could be counted in RT as reserves. The implications for the solution
algorithm are unclear - can BME recognize the additional reserves thus
carried? Would it result in fewer imports and lower BME prices? What if the
reserve requirements used as input to BME were manipulated downward for
reserves on exports? What happens if BME did not schedule the export(s)?

2 Subject to the ISO providing detailed RT reserve info, it seems that the
reserves should be carried in RT and that SCD should not be allowed to
dispatch with units that were not available to BME (thus resulting in the
large price disparities). If the ISO had adequate reserves in RT, SCD
should not be allowed to produce RT price reductions relative to what BME
is doing. However, having said this, if there are no energy resources to
maintain reserve levels AND the ISO needs to maintain its regulation room,
the next thing to go is load. To my long understanding, we do not shed load
to avoid shedding load (at least not to maintain reserves...)

Perhaps if BME has some adjustments and the missing Mws are accounted for,
little needs to be done in RT. (This does not mean that SCD handles GTs
correctly - that is still a commit problem it is incapable of resolving...)

3 At one point, we had approved use of BME prices to settle all HA
transactions. This approach was scuttled by the ISO when they discovered
that there were persistent, unidirectional price differences between the
proxy busses and their connected in-NY zones. We then retreated to
automating what is done under ECA B; substituting BME prices only under
constrained ramp or ATC conditions.

The ISO should review this again. Does the price difference remain,
inviting gaming? If so, is there a way for the MMU to watch for or prevent
inappropriate opportunistic behavior? A full, partial 3rd settlement would
lessen the sting of HA prices that are out of synch with RT.

4 The ISO should review the multipliers in the LP solution that insure that
energy, then regulation and then the 3 types of reserve are maintained.
They should be no more than required for a proper solution outcome. Prices
at $65000 are not necessary and misleading (while mathematically
correct...). Also, if we are to consider settling transactions at BME
prices, such an outcome would result in considerable opposition...

5 Another non-controversial change would be to extend the DADRP
participants to hour ahead evaluation. In the instant circumstance, it is
likely that BME would have chosen some of those loads opposed to imports
(there was no congestion so some of those western loads might have looked
pretty good...). Since there is the issue that the DADRP is subsidized, I
would propose that, if extended to BME, that the DA bids be used for BME
evaluation. If nothing else look at it as sending money to companies in
NYS.

"Re: Voltage Limits","
barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Chuck,
     I understand (barely)the mechanism which predicts/solves the voltage
constraints, my problem is more coming from the price visibility side. It's like
driving down the road with a speedometer swinging between 55 and 85 and a cop
sitting in the medium. Do you speed up or slow down? Going the wrong way could
get you a day in court. Multiple units OOM, Gen bid guarantees, BME' s $900 in
every zone, hugh positive congestion one hour, hugh negative congestion the next
(Zone P), RT prices $60-90 and neighboring ISO's in the high hundreds (PJM) and
$1000 for three hours in ISONE and one can only wait and see what the uplift
was. I may get my cocker spaniel to stick his head out the window and use the
elevation of his ears as a speed estimate. How the heck does one drive in the
NYISO market?

This is perhaps one of the most interesting, exciting and profitable businesses you will ever see. HERE IS HOW IT WORKS: (1) There are more than 3 million businesses for sale - and thousands of them are easy to find on the Internet.(2) There are also about 12,000 Public Companies and most of them want to acquire or merge with a private business because it will improve their sales revenue, profits and increase shareholder value. The Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) business is no more complicated than putting together the private company Sellers and the Public Company Buyers - showing you how to become an M&amp;A Matchmaker using E-mail is what we teach you. &nbsp;There are large Public Companies (NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ) and smaller Public Companies (OTC/BB). This means you can do big deals and small deals. One of our Associates that started in January will earn $250,000 cash and $1 million in Public Company (AMEX) stock on his first deal. Another new Associate with no experience just completed her first deal and earned $300,000; she only started five weeks ago! &nbsp;Each deal is different and you may earn more or less.<BR>
 <BR>
This is one of the hottest business opportunities in the country right now. It has been written about in many leading business magazines. This is the only opportunity of its kind where you work directly with an Attorney and an Investment Banker who can show exactly how to be successful in this exciting and very profitable industry. THERE IS NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED - Just the ability to send e-mail from your computer and follow step-by-step directions.You will get complete assistance by phone, E-MAIL and fax for three years. &nbsp;The reason you will be successful is that every time you make money the Attorney and Investment Banker who help you share the profits with you. This way everyone is a WINNER.<BR>

Folks,

Attached is an agenda for the ICAP deliverability conference call on
Friday.  To facilitate discussion, I have put together a very rough draft
that identifies several of the major approaches and the concerns raised and
concerns addressed by each.  I would invite all folks participating to make
comments clarifying each alternative as well as raising additional concerns
or identifying other concerns that are addressed by each approach.  If you
have another approach, please submit it for the group's consideration.

Thanks

"Media Reports","
As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

"Daily Update","
Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

"New Course Offerings","Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

     The Nominating Committee of the NYISO Business Issues Committee is
seeking qualified individuals willing to serve as Vice-Chairperson of the
Committee.
     The scope of responsibilities of the Business Issues Committee can be
found in Article 9 of the ISO Agreement.  As specified in the Agreement,
the Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson will serve a one-year term, and the

     The Nominating Committee will review the credentials of the presenting
candidates and may screen the pool.  Although the Nominating Committee is
required (pursuant to the BIC By-Laws) to bring at least one qualified
candidate before the Business Issues Committee for election, the Committee
encourages all qualified persons with an interest in this position to
submit their credentials.
     The Nominating Committee requests that interested individuals, who are
not representatives of the members or sectors listed above, to present the
following material by 5:00 pm, September 7, 2001.

position of Vice-Chairperson, and describe your ability to make the
necessary time commitment.
3.   Please describe any training or experience you have had in mediation,
ADR or consensus building.
4.   Please describe briefly why you would like to have this job.

"New Certification Form","
As part of our on going effort to streamline the ICAP process, we are
implementing a
new method and form for the monthly ICAP certification process.  Starting
with the August 24, certification
date please use the attached form.  Both Suppliers and LSEs will use the
same form thus eliminating
two forms for those who buy and sell ICAP.  Also, the forms will not longer
be faxed to our office.
We are requiring that you password protect the workbook and email it to us.
Your password will be the
same one you are currently using for bid and offer forms.  If you do not
have a password, please contact
Serena Barrett or myself and one will be issued to you.

It is important that you read the legal page in the workbook.

Please review the workbook spreadsheet ""List Page"" and find your company's
8 character registrant name.
If you do not find your company or the name of a company you do ICAP
business with please contact me.
Starting with the winter strip auction your 8 character registrant name
will also be your new registrant name
for bid and offer forms.

Attached are three workbooks.  The one you will use monthly is blank and
ready for use.
The other two were developed as examples to answer your basic questions.
Please contact me by email if you have any questions.

Regards,
Bob Boyle

Hola cabrones,
Ok, aqui esta el plan! Due to some very important people dragging their bums things have changed slighty. We will now be going to Playa del Carmen. Many of us have been there before. It is a great place and well situated. The hotel is called the Rui Playa and the price is $585.00 smackeroos all inclusive. It is a fun jet package I found through Way to Go Travel agency here in town. It is a very nice place and I urge everyone going to look at the funjet travel site and check it out. There is two people to a room and we can work out when we get down there who's bunking with whom. Again the dates are leaving Thursday September 6th returning Sunday the 9th.  Please call Elizabeth at Wat to Go Travel at 713-467-2262 and work out paying. They can either send you the ticket or you can pick it up. Don and I have already reserved our places and I have left a list of those that have confirmed to me with Elizabeth. They are as follows. My! cell phone is 281-450-6115 please call me for anything. If I left anyone out please inform me all we need to do is give her the names. For those of you who may have to cancel I suggest buying the ticket insurance it's only $35. Please do this asap because sure as shit the prices just like morning wood will rise again.

"Re: A response on today's horrid event from a Canadian","     to Rambo in Mansfield/South Dallas

   My e-mail was in response to all the ones i've received lately.
   Did i criticize the public displays ? i just said i didn't
understand them.  Whatever floats your boat, G.
   I'd like to further emphasize one point.
   On a INDIVIDUAL basis, Americans are the most compassionate and
good-hearted people i've personally come across  (much more than
the Europeans - i was there, i saw - and much, much more, i hate
to say, than us)  We are all refugees, and all of us have been
helped along the way, if not with $10,000 in cash (lol), but on a
personal level, by kind, compassionate people. The scale of blood
and money donations we are seeing now can never be approached
anywhere else in the world.  And not just in this extreme, tragic
case, this has always been true.  The Marshall Plan, earthquakes
in Turkey, floods in Bangladesh, etc... Americans have always been
there to help, if not in manpower, at least in cash donations. In
the immortal words of you-know-who, Americans are good people.
   However, good people do not patriots make.
   Where were the patriots when, after Pearl Harbor, the
resolution in Congress to enter WWII passed by ONE vote ? Were the
patriots, those people who lined up the streets of Washington and
claimed that F.D.R. was a warmonger, a traitor, and a Jew-lover ?
   Were they patriots, those young men and women (""the flower of
America's youth"") who insulted and spat at the Vietnam Veterans
who returned home ? Let us not argue the merits of the (illegal)
war in VN. But shouldn't patriots at the very least show support
for their troops ?
   Were they patriots, those companies which, during the height of
the Iran hostage crisis, tried to deal with the enemy and make a
profit ? (Marc Rich was not an isolated case)
   In the next few weeks, will people try to dump their stocks in
the hope of making a killing or cutting their losses ?  (Greyhound
stocks anyone ?)  Continenetal has already laid off 12,000 people,
couldn't they have waited, and don't you believe they wanted to
make the cuts all along but jumped on the opportunity ?
   America at its heart is a nation of self-interest - money.
It goes to war in the name of that self-interest, not in the name
of IDEALS (the Gulf War was meant to defend and save the poor,
little Kuwaitis...rite...)  That self-interest makes America rich
and strong - and all the more power to them, we all want to be
rich and strong.  The question is, will its people die for it?
   Hopefully, we'll never find out - no one wants a fukkin' war.
I just wonder (WONDER, not question, criticize, or judge) if the
same Joe Smith who is screaming for war rite now on CNN, in a few
months' time, after the grief and justifiable anger have died
down, will he be so willing then to drop everything and go to war,
HIMSELF, on the GROUND in Pakistan or Afghanistan.  Once more,
Buddha saves us, we'll never find out.

PS
   I claim that if i win the $10,000,000 Lotto jackpot, i will
donate half of it to chairty. With my TRACK RECORD, would you
wonder my resolve ?  How dare you ?  Joe Smith does have a track
record too.

"ISO Navigator Alert: NERTO Report Issued by ALJ Young","
Aaron Breidenbaugh <aaron@global2000.net> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Greetings,

FERC ALJ Young has issued his eagerly anticipated report on Northeast
RTO formation.

Subscribers may obtain a copy of the report, business plan, and
appendices here:

http://www.iso-navigator.com/NERTO_Business_Plan_Final.pdf

Judge Young recommends the appointment of settlement judges for the
post-mediation ""going forward"" process and refrains from advocating any
particular governance structure or stakeholder processes apart from
tallying the number of stakeholder supporters for each.

Over the objections of the largest group of stakeholders, including PJM,
as well as virtually all generators and marketers, the Judge advocates
Option 1-M concerning market design issues. He cites with favor its
incorporation of ""best practices"" from NYISO and ISO-NE and criticizing
Option 3-M's failure to identify best practices, ""let alone implement
them"". Option 1-M is the option favored by NYISO and ISO-NE and
anticipates end-state implementation by Q3 2004. It is described in
Appendix B of the Business Plan.

The Judge implies in his criticism of the very aggressive Option 3-M
that some of its supporters at least ""would sacrifice optimal RTO market
benefits in the long term to exploit more immediate economic opportunity
in a sprint"". He also notes that ""PJM was unwilling during the mediation
to concede that any practice pre-identified by another ISO in fact
constituted a best practice."" The following statement is especially
noteworthy:

""I left the mediation confident that the PJM paradigm will prove a more
than adequate platform for the Northeastern RTO- provided it
incorporates essential best elements from the other ISOs, and provided
further that impatience, haste and greed are not permitted to drive RTO
implementation at the expense of sound policy.""

Although he takes no position on whether the RTO CEO or Board members
should have to resign their current positions, the Judge does advocate a
an RTO-dedicated staff that does not work for the existing ISOs. He also
acknowledged the fact that the mediation process ""decidedly
disadvantaged"" smaller, newer entities, and that the Commission needs to
address this problem in the post-mediation process.

The report notes the technical difficulties likely to be faced in
scaling up the PJM platform to the entire Northeast and the vagaries of
NY and NE:

""None of the software experts whom I consulted believes the Northeastern
RTO will require an entirely new software system.  Neither does any of
them believe that any currently-employed software is capable of managing
a system as large and complex as the RTO.   The Northeastern RTO will
constitute the largest energy market in the world.  The complexity of
the technology it will take to implement and administer that market is
staggering.  I learned during the course of the mediation that the
complexity of electric system management software is second only to that
of the banking industry.  I also learned that there are very, very few
vendors who design such software, and those vendors have a tremendous
economic incentive to overestimate their/their software's capabilities
to secure such lucrative contracts.  Once entrenched, moreover, it would
be exceedingly difficult and expensive to switch vendors in the event
the original software proved inadequate.  And that would be the least of
the problems.

Accordingly, it is my strong recommendation that independent,
non-vendor, experts be involved in the technology assessment from the
outset.  These experts should be involved in both the IT and
applications technologies assessments, and should be required to
demonstrate that they have no financial interest whatsoever in the
outcomes of those assessments.  This will assure that the RTO has the
advantage of continuing and unbiased expert opinions with respect to
software provider representations and capabilities throughout the
assessment process and beyond.""

(Left unstated was the fact that PJM itself is the software vendor of
the PJM platform.)

The ALJ strongly advocates that the Commission preclude comments on the
Report or, alternatively, that if comments are allowed, replies should
be permitted.

Aaron

(Copies of this email are being circulated to the TIE list as a public
service.)

"results of football pool","Hello Everyone,

	Well, this week was no doubt a tough week for us all picking the winners. Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week. Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game. Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville. In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong. Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points. Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win. George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored. There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62. 

	There is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon. I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win. Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2. If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it. I do not want to go more than $3 for now. Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars. This is not my idea to have some people give up more money, but just a suggestion I got from a few people. 
Below are the number of games missed by each person this week.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

AUGUST BIRTHSTONE: PERIDOT
=============================
Today's birthstone for August, peridot was also a favorite of
the ancients.  This lovely transparent yellowish green to deep
chartreuse stone was quite a powerful gem.  It was considered
an aid to friendship and was also believed to free the mind of
envious thoughts.  Because of its yellowish color, it was also
believed to cure or prevent diseases of the liver and dropsy.
And if that's not enough, if worn on the left arm it would
protect the wearer from the evil eye.

Peridot is also popular today, but probably more for its
lovely shade of green than its professed powers.  While not
particularly brilliant, the richness of the is color can be
exceptional.  It comes in shades of yellowish green to darker,
purer green colors.  Unfortunately, because of its rarity
most people never see peridot in the deeper, purer green color
that is so prized.

Some caution should be exercised in wearing peridot.  It is not
a very hard stone and may scratch easily.  Also, some stones-
like green sapphire or green tourmaline-can look like peridot
and be mistaken or misrepresented.


THE DIAMOND MARKETPLACE
============================
In diamond bridal jewelry, the current demand is for:
* G-H color and SI-VS clarity
* Sizes form 1-1.5 carats and over 2 carats
* Round brilliants and princess cuts
* Ideal cuts


FAMOUS DIAMOND PEOPLE: DIAMOND JIM BRADY (1856-1917)
=====================================================
""Them that has 'em wears 'em,"" said Diamond Jim Brady, a man
who did much to popularize diamonds in the United States.
Born poor, honest, and Irish, James Buchanan Brady was a
salesman of extraordinary abilities.  During the ""Gay
Nineties,"" when American railroads were expanding across
the continent, Brady made a fortune estimated at more than
#10 million selling railroad cars.  During World War I, he
sold 38,000 cars to the French government in one sale.

Brady had a different set of monogrammed jewelry for every
day of the month, including a ""Transportation Set"" comprised
of a jewelled rail car, tank car, and caboose studded with
2,548 diamonds and other precious stones.  He personally
owned more than 20,000 diamonds, and sometimes wore
$25,000 in jewelry on single day (a fortune in that day).

When he died, Brady's will left a few of his most
elaborate pieces of jewelry to long-time friends.  The rest
of his fortune went to charity.


DIAMOND COPYCATS
=============================================
Cubic zirconia dates to 1937, when two German mineralogists
discovered the cubic form of zirconium oxide. Soviet
scientists learned how to ""grow"" this mineral in a laboratory
in the 1970s, and Swarovski & Co. began producing it for
mass consumption in the 1980s. As it became more widely
available, CZ quickly became popular with jewelry designers.
New developments have led to a sparkling array of CZ in every
color imaginable.

Though cubic zirconia looks like diamond, there are some
noticeable differences. CZ has slightly less brilliance than
diamond and a hardness of 8.5 on the Mohs scale [diamond is
10]. CZ is 75% heavier and, because it's grown in a
controlled environment, a crystal isn't used if it's not
perfect.

Moissanite was discovered in 1893 when Nobel-prize-winning
scientist Henri Moissan uncovered minute quantities of a
new mineral from a meteorite that crashed thousands of years
before. In the late 1980s, Cree Research, Durham, NC,
developed a way to produce moissanite crystals in a lab. In
1995, a master diamond cutter discovered that when cut
properly, created moissanite crystals could look like diamond.
Moissanite's color is comparable to I-J-K colors of diamond,
is 9.5 on the Mohs scale and has a refractive index of 2.648-
2.691 (diamond is 2.417), dispersion of 0.104 (diamond is
0.044) and specific gravity of 3.21 (diamond is 3.52).

IDEAL CUT
===================
An Ideal Cut round brilliant diamond is one which is cut
to a specific range of proportions (Ideal proportions) and
also has an Ideal (0) grade for both polish and symmetry.
This has been defined by the American Gem Society Labs. as
the top, or zero grade, in their grading system. Diamonds
attaining this grade are sometimes referred to as AGS000
(AGS triple zero's). The proper grade, however, is simply
AGS0 (AGS zero). This cut grade has also come to be called
the ""American Ideal Cut"" based on its acceptance in this
country.  A true AGS triple zero or triple ideal is a diamond
where the proportion (cut), polish and symmetry are all
at the top (zero) grade.

Unfortunately, the Gemological Institute of America (GIA)
does not provide a cut grade in its grading report. They
provide only the table % and total depth % for the stone.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine the individual
contributions of the crown, girdle and pavilion to the total
depth and no crown or pavilion angles are given. In order
to determine if a GIA-graded diamond meets the AGS Ideal (0)
grade for proportion, it is necessary to measure the stone
for all the missing data. Fortunately, this can be done quite
quickly and easily using an automated proportion analyzer
called a ""SARIN"" (after the Co. which produces it) whose s
oftware can be programmed to AGS specifications. Thus, since
GIA grades of Excellent for polish and symmetry are considered
equivalent to the AGS Ideal grades, a GIA-graded diamond can,
with a Sarin analysis give as much information as an AGS
grading report. This information is important in making an
informed buying decision.


FANCY COLORED DIAMONDS
==============================================
The GIA grades the saturation of color by 9 different verbal
categories. They are: Faint, Very Light, Light, Fancy Light,
Fancy, Fancy Dark, Fancy Intense, Fancy Deep and Fancy Vivid.
Normally, Faint, Very Light, and Light in sizes under three
carats are not considered exceptional enough to pay premiums
for. To collect or mount in jewelry, these stones will often
trade in the same ranges as nice white diamonds. Often
mounting a stone in these saturation categories will ""kill""
the color. Light pink and blue in a larger stone may be
desirable, if, and only if, the stone doesn't turn white when
mounted. Diamond dealers often refer to these color categories
as those you ""have to read the certificate to find the color"".
Generally avoid these stones unless you are looking at eye
clean 5-15 carat ""light"" pinks or blues. They will be expensive
stones.

The rarest and most valuable colored diamonds are vibrant reds.
In fact,  one of the highest per-carat prices ever paid for a
diamond was for a purplish red stone weighing just over
0.95 carats.  Sold at auction in 1987,  this fiery beauty
brought an astounding  $926,000 per carat.  More recently,  a
5.11 carat red diamond is rumored to have sold privately for
$8 million.  However,  not all fancy colored diamonds sell for
such colorful prices  (please excuse the pun).


PLATINUM AS A JEWELRY METAL
====================================
Throughout the world, platinum jewelry is made in a purity
of at least 85 per cent platinum, and in Europe and the USA,
95 per cent is the norm. Other platinum group metals -
palladium, ruthenium and iridium - and copper and cobalt are
commonly alloyed with platinum to optimize its working
characteristics and wear properties.

One of the main advantages of platinum for jewelry
fabrication is its strength and resistance to tarnish. It can
be repeatedly heated and cooled without hardening and
oxidation effects, while even the most slender sections of
platinum permanently retain their shape, providing a secure
setting for diamonds and giving jewelry designers a freedom
of invention not always possible with other materials. Perhaps
the best example of platinum's technical virtuosity is the
tension ring, in which a gemstone is held in place by the
tensile strength of the platinum ring shank alone.

Platinum does make certain demands on the jeweler's skills.
It requires high temperature melting and casting equipment
(pure platinum melts at 1769'C) and a scrupulously clean
working environment. Careful attention to polishing technique
is needed to achieve the highly reflective finish which shows
a diamond or other precious stone at its best.


ONLINE SPENDING TRENDS
====================================
Though Internet users are spending more time at retail sites,
online spending is down. Forrester Research reported online
spending fell to $3.2 billion in June from $3.9 billion in
May. Online shoppers spent an average of $245 per person
online in June, a decrease of $20 from May.

Internet usage overall, however, is up. Neilson/NetRatings
reported 58% of U.S. households, nearly 102 million
households, are online. In July, Internet users spent an
average of 10 hours and 19 minutes online, up 7% from a year
earlier. The growth in Internet use, Neilson/NetRatings
reports, is driven by late adopters and more aggressive use
from the enormous Internet population.

While there has been a drop in online jewelry sales the
past several months compared to last year, forecaster
agree that online jewelry sales will outpace the growth of
consumer e-commerce as a whole in the next three years. As
customers gain experience and here more success stores about
online diamond and jewelry buying, their increased
confidence translates into increased sales.


BLACK DIAMONDS: HOT TREND BUT BE CAREFUL
=================================================
Black diamonds are not new.  They have been a curiosity for
centuries, but is a recent new trend for jewelry.  They are
typically opaque, very heavily included, often with surface
reaching inclusions and fractures that mar desirability.
They are also very difficult to cut, so you often find them
in poor makes.  Buyers need to be aware that most of the
black diamonds currently being used in jewelry is treated
and not natural.  There is nothing wrong with using
treated black diamonds as long as you are told they are
treated and you pay the appropriate price, as opposed to
the more expensive natural black diamonds.

Since the natural black diamonds are so hard to cut, melee
sizes used in pave work is almost always treated.  Here are
some simple test for determining natural versus treated.
* Under strong light, treated diamonds have edges that
appear deep brown rather than black
* When the surface is examined with a 10x loupe, treated
diamonds seem spotty or the color is uneven
* When tested with a electronic diamond tester, treated
black diamonds generally are indicated as ""not diamond.""

While the treated black diamond is in fact a diamond,
the electronic diamond tester indicates it is not because
during the treatment, the material becomes very electrically
conductive.


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:

"May & June 2000 1st settlement adjustment invoice banking instructions","
DCongel@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Market Participants:

In a billing inquiry sent to us concerning the June 2000 adjustments
made per the email below, which was sent on 7/10/2000, we noticed
an incorrect value was stated for the NYISO clearing account balance
prior to adjustment.  That value was $7,831,072.52.  The value should
have been $7,262,238.10, and this has caused problems for reconciling
your invoices.

We apologize for any confusion that may have been caused by this
misstatement.  Any questions concerning this issue can be directed to
customer relations at 518-356-6060.

__________________________________________________________

""Customers should note that their invoices have been adjusted to recognize
a net zero impact to the NYISO clearing account.  Each settlement
adjustment was  performed to report each customers' share in residual
adjustments and uplift.  In the initial billing of these periods, the
monthly OATT Schedule 1 rates were computed with forecasted residual &
uplift costs.  Had the NYISO settled residuals and uplift in the current
period, as it now does, customers would have realized these costs
immediately.  The advisory billing statement formats now reported by the
NYISO allow customers to see the actual costs of these components.  Once
the net NYISO clearing account impact from these billings was determined,
an adjustment was computed based upon customers' respective ratio shares of
transmission service settled during each month, adjust these costs out of
their settlements.  Any difference between the adjustment and residual &
uplift costs reported on the advisory statements are due to additional
residuals or uplift from the settlement adjustment process.""

June 2000 adjustment to recognize a net zero impact to the NYISO clearing
account:

NYISO clearing account balance prior to adjustment:     (strikethrough:
$7,831,072.52 ) $7,262,238.10

Customer Adjustment:     Customers' June 2000 Transmission Service
Transacted x (strikethrough: $7,831,072.52)  $7,262,238.10/ 13,825,630 MWh

"Football is here, ARE YOU READY?","World Sports Exchange

Press Release

September 2, 2001

St. John's, Antigua - World Sports Exchange, WSEX.com, the largest and most respected sports book on the Internet is happy to announce its ""Finally Football"" celebration.  From now until Saturday, September 8, 2001, WSEX will be rewarding both it's new and existing customers with a 10% bonus on all deposits received during this period.  Yes, that's right. WSEX is paying a 10% bonus on deposits for a limited time.  So to all of you who have asked for it in the past, come and get it while it lasts.

World Sports Exchange is the largest online sports book in the world.  No other operation offers more wagers on more sports than WSEX.  We have football, basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis, golf, soccer, auto racing and more.  We offer straight wagers, parlays, teasers, ""if"" bets, round robins, action points and beyond.  You want props?  WE HAVE PROPS!!!  We have so many props that we have PROPS on PROPS!!!  Every day of the week in football, basketball, and baseball.  If you can't find it here, it doesn't exist.

Come join the Internet gambling revolution.  Find out why WSEX is always interviewed by the major media for a story on Internet gambling. We are the biggest and the best, it's as simple as that.  We have the highest limits on more bets than any other online book in the world.  We have been featured on 60 Minutes, HBO Real Sports, ESPN's Behind the Lines, ABC's 20/20, and MSNBC.com just to name a few.  We have also appeared in numerous magazines and newspapers including Business Week, the NY Times, the Wall Street Journal, the LA Times, Cigar Aficionado, Yahoo Internet Life, and many many more.

World Sports Exchange has been licensed and regulated by the government of Antigua and Barbuda since 1996. Don't be fooled by other fly-by-night operations that claim to have licenses or claim to have been in business a long time.  We have a long track record as a dependable and reliable sports book WSEX.com is the real deal.

World Sports Exchange is the only major sports book in the world to offer online interactive wagering on sporting events 'in progress'.  In football, baseball, golf, and basketball, WSEX allows you to bet after every play. If you love baseball, WSEX will even let you bet on what a player will do for each 'at bat' (i.e. single, double, triple, strikeout etc.).

We have once again upgraded our hardware this summer to process more wagers than ever.  Last year we documented our system at over 300 bets per minute for an hour before kickoff.  This year we have the capacity to handle more than double that amount.  If you can use a mouse, you can place a wager.

If you want betting options, state of the art technology, reliability, and an impeccable track record for payment, there really is no other choice.  You are cheating yourself if you are not playing at WSEX.com.

So finish what you started.  Come visit us at www.wsex.com Go to the Payment Options page ""www.wsex.com/about/payment_opts.html"" and fund your account.

Remember, IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACTION, NOTHING CAN HAPPEN!!!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  ""Generating
resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North
America during the 2001/2002 winter season,"" says Michehl R. Gent,
President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC).  ""Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions
and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater
than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC
Regions.""

For your convenience, a copy of the press release announcing the
2001/2002 Winter Assessment is shown below.  A copy is also available on
the following NERC web site:

NERC Issues 2001/2002 Winter Reliability Assessment

Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  ""Generating
resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North
America during the 2001/2002 winter season,"" says Michehl R. Gent,
President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC).  ""Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions
and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater
than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC
Regions.""

""Transmission systems in North America are also expected to perform
reliably,"" he added, ""although some transmission congestion is expected
during the course of the winter.""  According to the report, fuel
supplies, inventories, and deliveries are expected to be adequate this
winter.  Natural gas storage facilities are currently at levels 20
percent greater than the same time last year.

The report notes that the Pacific Northwest remains under a severe
drought condition that limits its ability to generate electricity from
hydropower resources, although reductions in customer demand are
sufficient to preclude the need for rotating blackouts.  California's
demand and resource situation has improved since last winter due to a
combination of increased resources and reduced demand.  California is
expected to have adequate capacity margins throughout the winter.

For a copy of the 2001/2002 Winter Assessment, visit NERC's web site at
(http://www.nerc.com).  NERC's web site also includes information on the
electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and
activities.

*********************

NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America.  It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to ""keep the lights on"" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems.  NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account
for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada,
and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.

"EnronOnline -Stack Manager Changes","We have made the  following modifications to the EnronOnline applications.

Stack Manager Changes

Fill Order Enhancements - (Effective Tuesday September 25)
?	To fill a Top of Stack order in Stack Manager, Right click on the pink shaded order in the depth window of Stack Manager and select fill.
?	The trader now has the ability to fill limit orders that appear at the top of the trader's stack on both sides. 
?	The order will now be filled at the full order volume regardless of the trader's stack volume.
?	Filling an order will not move the trader's price or cause a hedge to occur.

Resize floated stack windows- (Effective Tuesday September 25)

You will now have the ability to resize the stack window to the desired extent.

Website Changes ( Effective Monday September 24)

Limit Order Restrictions on Physical Transactions -
?	Customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions. If a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it.
?	If a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price, both orders will be cancelled. The customer would have effectively transacted with himself.

Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks.

"NYISO - Advisory Billing Statements","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is in the process of migrating the NYISO billing system to a new
server.  Customer advisory billing statements for July 15 - 17 may not
contain metered megawatthour data supplied by market meter authorities.  In
the absence of metered megawatthour data, the billing process for Balancing
Market settlements is performed using instantaneous integrated data from
the NYISO Performance Tracking System.  Completion of this migration is
anticipated for late evening of Wednesday, July 18.  Market Participants
are asked to refrain from submitting billing inquiries for July 15-17
billings until further notice.  The NYISO will rerun the aforementioned
billing dates as soon as the migration has been completed.  The NYISO will
inform the market when this migration has been completed and indicate when
rebillings for July 15-17 may be expected to be posted.

The NYISO apologizes for any inconveniences caused by this project.

Regards,
Customer Relations
518-356-6060

"MIS","
barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



While being entertained at the latest OSS working group meeting,  the limitation
of being able to only schedule MIS 14 days in advance was brought up.
Once upon a time, when business rules and bidding rules were changing faster
then tires on pit row, it was agreed to limit the entries to 14 days in order to
avoid having long term deals fail (as per nameless NYISO guy). Now that things
have slowed down and bidders are more savvy and able to babysit their bids, we
should be looking to expand the time frame for placing longer term bids in MIS.
An  informed NYISO guy (different guy by the way) said it would be easy and
using 4-5 man days to do. I have talked to Ray Kinney (Chair of the S&P WG) and
gave him the same song. If your shop would like to see the MIS limit lifted,
have your representative to the S&P WG help it along. Please don't bother Ray
directly or my TIE messages will rerouted to the Quilting Forum.

UNITED WAY 2001

Building Houston's Future, Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign, officially began Monday, August 6 and runs through August 17.  Enron's goal this year is $2.9 million and the EWS goal is $1,276,000.  Enron will match every employee's contribution dollar-for-dollar.

The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers and there's no better way than to give to the United Way, which touches over 50% of the families on the Texas Gulf Coast.

ON-LINE PLEDGING
We are again using an on-line pledging system.  Please click on https://hrglobal.enron.com to make your contribution and learn more about this year's campaign. You will need your GIS ID (which is your ""9..."" number, not your ""P..."" number) and password.  If you are not sure what your ID and password are, please go to https://ehronline.enron.com, click the ""Accept"" button, and then click on ""Forgot your User ID or Password?""  If you have questions regarding access, please call the HRGIM help desk at ext. 3-5666.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets announced today that Ivan Boileau has been named general manager of Garden State Paper, its recycled newsprint mill in Garfield, New Jersey.  Ivan was formerly the assistant general manager of Enron's Papiers Stadacona paper mill in Quebec City, where he was responsible for pulping, paper machine operations and maintenance. Under Ivan's leadership, Garden State Paper is expected to increase annual production, as well as produce higher quality recycled newsprint at a lower cost.
Enron acquired Garden State Paper in July 2000 and Papiers Stadacona in April 2001. The acquisition of both mills now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North America. Enron began offering various financial hedges to the Forest Products industry in 1997, and today is the world's leading provider of customized financial risk management services to both buyers and sellers of pulp, paper and wood products. In addition, Enron provides capital services, inventory management and long-term fixed pricing contracts for physical product for up to 10 years.

EIM Trading
Enron Industrial Markets Middle Office has a busy six months ahead of it as it works to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to handle the tremendous growth in the Industrial Markets Trading.  Key milestones will be the continuous improvement of customer service (both internal and external), the development/retention of team members, and the implementation of the first phase of new systems focused on electronic trade capture, robust physical order management, and settlements.  These milestones will be key to a strong finish in 2001 and being in a good position for the growth expected in 2002.

EGM Fundamentals
OPEC Producer Profiles
Columbia University summer associates Majed Limam and Noha Kasrawi have prepared a birds-eye view of individual OPEC producers and the types of crude they export. Working from public and proprietary information sources, they offer readers background information, a description of each player's role within OPEC, the structure of its oil industry, breakdown of its exports and synopsis of upstream, midstream and downstream sectors. Each country profile contains hyperlinks to crude assays and information on the marketing of their crudes, as well as maps. The results of their research can be viewed by selecting in-house analysis on the EGM Fundamentals webs site at: <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/>

Tracking Wholesale Gasoline
If gasoline rack prices are on your mind, a recently completed database that allows users to track gasoline 87 rack prices in eleven US cities, for both branded and unbranded gasoline, should be just the thing. The final product, developed by EGM Fundy staffer Jim Cole and Columbia University summer associate Majed Limam, gives a theoretical value for gasoline netback prices by subtracting tariffs and transportation costs from the average rack price for each city.  The output is displayed in graphical form in excel, but the major calculations and sorting occur in an Access database. The complete database is being updated continuously and will reside on the EGM Fundamentals web site in the nearest future. 

Worldwide Petchem Plant Shutdowns, Startups
The EGM Fundamentals Petchems team has compiled a master list of petrochemical plant shutdowns and startups worldwide from a wide variety of sources. This information, sorted by region and compound, allows users to confirm or anticipate changes in supplies impacting specific petchem markets. Updated weekly, the full report is available under In-house Analysis at: <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/petchems/>


IN THE NEWS

Deregulation Pilot Launch Successful: The Texas Electricity Deregulation Program pilot officially launched August 1 without a hitch. The pilot program, which hinged on the conversion of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas' (ERCOT) 10 control areas to a single control room in Austin, was delayed for two months due to computer problems. ERCOT is slowly transferring customers to their new providers and expect to complete the conversion by the end of August. The Texas electricity market will be fully deregulated on January 1, 2002.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Gas TPA agreement signed in Spain
Some very good news just in from Spain.  Last week, Enron Espa?a Generaci?n and Enagas reached a long-term agreement whereby Enagas will provide Enron Espa?a Generaci?n with regasification and transport services of natural gas of approximately 1,7bcm annually between Huelva and our planned combined cycle gas turbine plant at Arcos de la Frontera (Cadiz).  The services will begin in 2004, a date that coincides with our planned schedule for commencement of operations for the plant.  Well done to all the team.

Enron launches derivatives for three new tanker freight routes in shipping market
Enron's tanker freight team has this past week increased their derivatives portfolio (freight futures or 'swaps' of monthly contracts up to four months out) for three new tanker freight routes on EnronOnline. The tanker freight derivatives will be benchmarked against published indices for the three routes on the 'Baltic International' (BITRA) and International Independent Tanker Rate Assessment (IITRA) exchanges to help ship-owners (including oil companies), charterers, traders and even banks with exposure to the shipping market, mitigate the volatility of the freight element of tanker voyages traveling from Singapore to Japan (30,000 tonnes), the Caribbean to the US Gulf (70,000 tonnes) and Rotterdam to New York (33,000 tonnes).  Derivatives for the three routes will be managed out of the Singapore, Houston and London offices respectively.  ""Volatility of the tanker freight market has been as high as 62% on some routes,"" explains Scott Moncrieff, Enron's director of Liquids Freight Trading, based in London.  ""This has increased the importance of freight in relative terms on most tanker routes"" 

""In nine months we have already traded more than 3 million tonnes of paper freight, with a value of more than USD 14 million on the existing 80,000 tonne Sullom Voe (North Sea) to Willemshaven (Germany) route, and we expect to achieve similar levels of interest on our three new routes.  The tanker freight market is estimated to be worth more than USD 15 billion annually, and with increased liquidity being brought to the sector because of more players entering the market there's plenty of opportunity for us to build our business.""

The tanker freight team is also very heavily involved in the physical chartering of tanker vessels in Europe, The Americas, Arabian Gulf, Mediterranean, Far East and US West Coast, utilizing both the spot shipping market and Enron-controlled 'time-charter' vessels.

Nordic Pre-Pay Deal
The Nordic origination team has closed their first municipality power pre-pay deal in the last week. This is the first deal to be completed based on a financing structure that Enron Nordic Energy negotiated with Den Norske Bank earlier this summer. The deal is an important reference for municipalities that are interested in raising cash without selling their ownership in local power companies.

Steel Products
In March 2001 the European Steel Group commenced operations as an expansion of the successful effort underway in North America.  The group offers both physical and financial commodity grade steel products and serves as the only market-maker for a commodity market that is larger than that of crude oil.  The mission is to introduce the concept of indexation and financial contract to an industry where price transparency and risk management are virtually non-existent.  Physical and financial contracts for hot rolled and cold rolled steel are currently on offer via EnronOnline.  Interest from European producers and end-users is keen with the first financial transactions expected to close by the end of Q3. 

Since the team's inception they have successfully completed transactions with counterparties in Kazakhstan, Egypt, and China amounting to nearly 50,000 metric tonnes of steel.  

Forest Products
Enron's European Forest Products group is now trading physical market pulp to complement the financial derivatives products already offered for the last 2 years, increasing the volume under contract by 30%. 

Over the past six months, the group has recruited physical pulp traders to handle its day-to-day physical pulp trading business.  ""We have sourced long-term physical supplies of ""market pulp"" from around the world which will complement the financial derivative products we have already been offering,"" explains Martin Holmes, Director of Enron's European Forest Product Operations.

By trading both physical and financial contracts, Enron is pioneering more creative pricing in the industry by offering physical and financial cash and forward prices, as well as being the only market maker to quote longer dated swaps.

The group is also actively looking at structured finance opportunities including a number of inventory deals. These opportunities have arisen as the benchmark pulp price for Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK) has fallen by 45% over the past 6 months, leaving producers with high levels of pulp inventory in warehouses.

On 2nd July, the group launched the first standard contract for Bleached Eucalyptus (BEK) pulp on EnronOnline, and is actively marketing to industry brokers to adopt the contract as the benchmark index for pricing. The contract meets the commodity specifications of the BEK contract on the London Pulpex futures exchange, where Enron is the only market maker for all pulp futures contracts offered.

Remember when you and your little sister would sit down to play a game of Monopoly? And how you would always sneak an extra $500 bill while she would always manage to land on the orange properties and make you pay rent? Time for a rematch! PlaySite's Monopoly, offered in conjunction with Hasbro.com, has become one of our most popular online games. No cheating allowed, but you might want to learn from your sister and buy those orange properties.    Why? Because according to many Monopoly experts, the orange group as a whole provides some of the best return on investment for developed properties. This is because the Jail square is the one visited the most times during a game. You may be just visiting Jail, or you may have been sent there by a card, by the ""Go To Jail"" space on the board, or by rolling doubles. From the Jail, a player HAS to land on something that is on the second or third side of the board (the light purple, orange, red or yellow properties). Statistically, the property square that is most landed on is Illinois Avenue. But the orange properties are also top 15 contenders for the most landed on squares and are relatively inexpensive to develop.    What other winning strategies do you have? Do you like to own the utilities and railroads, or do you prefer the low-rent district of the dark purple and light blue property groups? Put your theories to the test and play Monopoly!       [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  e2 to e4  1 e2-e4 e7-e5 2. Bf1-c4 h7-h6 Is this programming code or a particularly bad Scrabble rack? Neither, it's algebraic notation and it's used to keep a history of the moves in a chess game. Now, before you go running away screaming at the word ""algebraic,"" you should note that it's easy to learn, it allows you to reconstruct games from the past that can help your own style of play, and it's a standard feature in PlaySite's chess. We call it ""Game History"" and you can view it in games you watch, or your own games. Reviewing game histories, and trying alternatives, is the best way to improve your chess-playing abilities. Check out how it works , and then take on some of the top PlaySite chess  players...      [IMAGE]     [IMAGE]      [IMAGE]   Q:  Who invented Monopoly?    A:  Nuh uh. If you said Charles Darrow, you've fallen for a long-believed myth about the origins of the game. In truth, the game evolved over time, finding its original shape in Elizabeth Magie's 1904 offering called The Landlord's Game. This game was modified by Magie over a period of years, adopted and refined under different names by other game designers, and eventually the game found its way to Charles Darrow. To be charitable, it could be said that Darrow popularized the game and got Parker Brothers to produce and sell the game, but we owe a big round of thanks, or a trip to GO and $200, to Elizabeth Magie.     [IMAGE]    Q:  Besides algebraic, what is the other form of chess notation called?  [IMAGE] [IMAGE] A:  Descriptive notation. Descriptive notation uses capital letters as abbreviations for the piece that is moving and its destination square. For instance, the move e4 (algebraic) would be notated as P-K4 (descriptive), in that the P (Pawn) is moving to the 4th row on the King's column (K4).     [IMAGE]  	[IMAGE]	[IMAGE]

own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.  
 

For enrollment, or more information on these courses, please log on to http://elm.enron.com.

"NYISO - Software Release for September 25","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:


Dear Market Participants:

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following enhancements to the
NYISO web server, MIS, SPIDER, Real-Time system and AutoSys that will be
implemented on September 25, 2001.

   A new pilot application will be deployed between the NYISO and ISO-New
   England to help automate the exchange of inter-regional transaction
   schedules.  Operations groups at both sites will receive automated
   transfer of transaction data to facilitate the hourly transaction
   checkout process.

   The NYISO web infrastructure will be enhanced through the implementation
   of BEA's WebLogic product. The new application server will be the
   platform utilized by the MIS to provide bidding and scheduling
   capability to Internet customers. The new software replaces the
   NetDynamics product, will provide the same functionality, and will be a
   more robust and reliable development platform for future enhancements.

   New data postings will be made available on the web site to provide
   real-time internal transmission limits and flows, as well as
   transmission line scheduled and actual outages. This posting is part of
   the collection of data requests made by the Business Issues Committee
   (BIC) in September 2000.

   A new Upload / Download template will be created that will enable Market
   Participants to get access to generator adjusted megawatt data (current
   and historic billing data).

If you any questions, please contact your Customer Relations Representative
or call the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

"Out of Merit","
barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Can anyone tell me the difference between solving for a line constraint (mw
limit) and a voltage constraint? Could it be that the former uses SCD and sets
LBMP and the other uses units out of merit and clobbers uplift?

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

In case the happening comes sooner rather than later, here is my contact info. I want you all to know it's been great working here and learning everything I have for the past 5 years, and I wouldn't trade this experience for anything, and I hope you wouldn't either (other than the Great Slide, that is). I hope everyone tries to stay in touch. If you haven't heard already, try this link out for an alumni directory to stay in touch. If you haven't already done so, please let me know your contact info as well.

"Organizational Announcement","
It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.

>>Asian-American groups plan walk to aid victims
>>By KRISTI RANGEL-KING
>>Chronicle correspondent
>>
>>Houston's Asian-American groups will sponsor a ""Walk
>>for America"" next week to raise money for victims of
>>the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
>>
>>""Walk for America is the unity of people all ages and
>>nationalities -- people coming together in a symbolic
>>gesture to illustrate our support and love for this
>>land we call home,"" says a letter from the Vietnamese
>>Culture and Science Association.
>>
>>Along with several other Asian-American organizations,
>>the VCSA will hold the event at the University of
>>Houston Main Campus, 8 a.m.-noon Oct. 28.
>>
>>The registration fee is $10 per walker and
>>participants are encouraged to solicit pledges and/or
>>donations.
>>
>>All proceeds from the three-mile walk will be donated
>>to the American Red Cross to aid in victim relief
>>efforts for those directly affected by the Sept. 11
>>acts of terror in New York City and the Pentagon in
>>Washington, D.C.
>>
>>Vietnamese-Americans have joined the fund-raising
>>efforts. In New York City, Vietnamese businessman
>>Trung Dinh Tran donated $2 million. The Little Saigon
>>Radio Station, broadcast in Houston and Orange County
>>and San Jose, Calif., raised $1 million for victim
>>relief.
>>
>>""In a crisis, everyone has an obligation to do
>>something,"" said Truong Nong, a member of the VCSA.
>>
>>The Vietnamese community wants to show its support for
>>President Bush and the fight against terrorism, said
>>Anhlan Nguyen, VCSA president.
>>
>>""American people have reached out their arms to help
>>us for the last 26 years,"" said Kim Nguyen, Walk for
>>America coordinator. ""We want to give back some of
>>what we have received.""
>>
>>In addition to raising money for victims, the walk
>>will also show that all Americans, regardless of race,
>>creed, ethnicity or religion, are united in their
>>efforts to stamp out terrorism, said Anhlan Nguyen.

"[Fwd: NY EDI - call for interest in general in-person meeting]","Please take note of the memo below from John D'Aloia of PSC Staff. John
is looking to see if there is any interest in the Marketer community in
attending a PSC hosted meeting in Albany to review the Commission's
Order on EDI as well as having the opportunity to have vendors present
to discuss what they have to offer in the way EDI technology. I believe
that it is extremely important that anyone without expertise in EDI or
the in-house capability of building such a system attend this meeting.
EDI will be a reality in New York by the end of this year and any
Marketer who is not EDI compliant by the end of 2002 will not be able to
do business in NY. Please respond directly to Mr. D'Aloia on whether or
not you would attend such a conference. Thank you.

-------- Original Message --------
Subject: NY EDI - call for interest in general in-person meeting
Date: Tue, 14 Aug 2001 12:50:58 -0400
From: john_daloia@dps.state.ny.us
To: nywg@listserv.allenergy.com

To: NY EDI Participants; New York ESCO/Marketers

Subject: Call for interest in general meeting on EDI

(Note: The topic of this message was communicated in a separate email
two
weeks ago to various parties.  It is being sent again to ensure we have
reached the appropriate audience of companies involved in retail access
in
New York)


The New York Public Service Commission issued Opinion 01-03 on July 23,
2001.  This order re-affirms the Commission's intent to have all New
York
utilities and eligible E/Ms begin implementation of EDI systems for
certain retail access transactions by year end 2001.  Please note that
all companies involved in these subject transactions will
be required to implement EDI.

 The Commission's Opinion and supplemental documents can be found on the
Commission's EDI web page at:
        http://www.dps.state.ny.us/98m0667.htm.

The purpose of this email message is to solicit ESCO/Marketer interest
in
participating in a general meeting in which PSC Staff would review the
overall EDI effort to date, respond to questions regarding the
requirements specified in Opinion 01-03 and discuss a proposed timetable
for testing and implementation. In addition to these agenda topics, the
meeting may also focus on the steps involved in implementing an EDI
system
(either in-house or via contract with a suitable vendor) and
arrangements
may be made to have several EDI vendors make presentations regarding
their
services or products.  We expect representatives from each of the
utilities to be in attendance to respond to any utility specific
questions
you may have. It is important to us in planning for this meeting that we
know which topics are most important to your company.

At this time we are envisioning a two day meeting on Thursday & Friday,
September 20 and 21, 2001, and to be held in Albany near or at the
Commission's offices. Let us know your company's interest in
participating
in such a meeting and forward your ideas on which topics should be
addressed in order to ensure that the meeting is as productive and as
informative as possible.  Please respond via email to PSC staff (John
D'Aloia) as soon as you can but no later than COB on Tuesday, August 21.

 All ESCO/Marketers are asked to respond - either affirmatively or
negatively, and to provide the contact information (name, phone number
and
email) for the appropriate people at your companies who should receive
EDI
correspondence.

Also, to ensure this notice gets thoroughly communicated, all utilities
are asked to forward this message to each of the active E/Ms they are
currently working with (hence, duplicate copies may be received by some
of
you).

Regards,

John D'Aloia

I talked with WGR (Phil Moyer and Jack Bates) and the TNRCC concerning the operating (Title V) permit issues at Gomez.  Two Title V permits were applied for by NNG and issued for Gomez.  Title V Permit No. O-00754 is for the gas processing operations and Permit No. O-00759 is for the compressor engines.  I will draft a letter and prepare the appropriate TNRCC forms required to void Permit No. O-00754.  The TNRCC forms will require Responsible Official signatures from Mike Nelson and Danny Pribble.

Charlie - yes the operating agreement from the summer of 1995 does require WGR to conduct all env activity.  My guess is that there was an oversight but also that the TNRCC won't make an issue out of this.  

Charlie (childs) - let us know what comes up.  thx

Subject:	RE: WGR Responsibility for Gomez facility.

I received a call from WGR (Bruce Ports 303-450-8401) on Tuesday 12/18.  Seems no permits were filed for the Gomez, Oates or Pikes Peak treaters (which were not running) during the period WGR was operating the plant for us.  WGR did file title V paperwork and paid fees for the Gomez compression that was operating.  Probably no harm since the plants weren't running, but may be a technical violation.  Bruce asked me for some history of operation which I gave him verbally [i.e. Intratex (an Enron affiliate) operated for NNG prior to WGR].  One point I stressed, was that we believed the operating agreement obligated WGR to file any required environmental permits (with or without NNG reminding them) and that NNG was deliberate in not performing duties that WGR was paid to perform.

Subject:	WGR Responsibility for Gomez facility.

Guys, with respect to the above, as you know, WGR was responsible for all compliance submittals during the time that we owned and they operated.  I know in the past, prior to their taking over ownership, I would remind them each year that a particular document was requried.  I figured that when they became owners, they didnt need me anymore.  Louie, you are right, Phil Moyer was the environmental contact for WGR and he was the one I would contact and apprise.  It just so happens that I have copies of previous annual submittals from WGR for the Gomez facility  when the facility was under our ownership, their responsibility.  I even have a copy of the Title V Permit.  When I was told that we no longer owned the faclity, I sent all information I had to WGR, but kept copies of the stuff I had, just in case.  I can send it one more time if you want me too.  Let me know.....

"Crisis Management","From Enron Corp Business Controls


Operations in Enron's Crisis Management Center will cease at the close of business in Houston on September 12.  All inquiries or information pertaining to the events of the last two days should now be directed to Enron Corp Business Controls at 713.345.2804.  In the event immediate assistance is required after hours, the Business Controls telephone number will be answered by the 24x7 security desk which can have a representative from Business Controls return your call immediately.

With respect to employees stranded around the United States, we regret that these employees should make their way back to Houston or their home office as best they can via commercial airlines, train, or rental car.  Unfortunately, corporate and other private aircraft will not be flying until sometime after restrictions are lifted on commercial carriers.  Therefore, Enron corporate aircraft should not be counted on to provide assistance in this situation.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Market Participants:

All advisory statements for 11/1999,12/1999, and 4/2001 have
been posted to each customers web site.  08/2001 will be done
this evening.

The NYISO was originally scheduled to invoice November 1999
and December 1999 on Friday 9/7/2001.  We have decided to delay
this until next week to allow extra time verifying the data, and
determining
the correct version mapping for reconciling invoices.  April 2001, and
August 2001 will be posted on 9/7/2001 as scheduled.

Payment dates associated with the November 1999 and December 1999
will be adjusted as necessary.  Market participants will be notified of any
change when the invoices get posted.

We apologize for the tardiness of this announcement.  If you have any
questions concerning this announcement please contact your market

"November 1999 Settlement Adjustment Invoices","The invoices for November 1999 settlement adjustments will be posted by
23:00 today, Monday, September 17, 2001.  The NYISO apologizes for any
inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices.

Transmission  Customers  will  observe adjustments to their settlements to:
(1)  recover  costs  related  to  adjustments  made  outside of the billing
process;  and  (2)  adjust  the  NYISO clearing account balance to zero for
November 1999 settlements.

With  regard  to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these
adjustments  could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant
data fix.  As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments
is  done  through  adjustments  outside  of the billing process.  The total
adjustment of $14,178.39 was allocated across 5,059,790 MWh.  Customers may
validate  their  respective  adjustments by computing their ratio shares of
the  $14,178.39  using 5,059,790 MWh as the denominator in their respective
ratios of their November 1999 load.  Customers will observe a difference in
the  denominators  used  in  the  ratio share allocation of this adjustment
versus  adjustment  #2.   This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the costs for
adjustment  #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the
adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment.

Prior  to  October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the
revenue   received  from  Schedule  1  charges,  which  were  comprised  of
forecasted  uplift  & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred
by  adjusting  subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.  In October
2000,  the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions
that  allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In  order  to  allow  any  changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be
settled  through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in
October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.  This results in
an  over-collection  which  is  being  returned  to  Customers  through  an
adjustment  to  their  monthly  balances.   This  billing treatment for the
November  1999  settlement  adjustments  resulted  in credits to the market
totaling  $5,583,559.78  allocated  across  5,074,229 MWh.  Customers where
allocated  their  portion  of  this  adjustment based upon their respective
ratio  shares of the 5,074,229 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for
the month.

November  1999  settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to

clearing  account  on  Tuesday, September 25, 2001.  Payments due to market

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"2001 Safety Calendar - CORRECTION","For those that use and rely upon the ETS Safety Connection Calendar, please
be aware there is a discrepancy in December. The December calendar states
the 25th and 26th are Enron holidays. It should state the 24th and 25th.

Please refer to http://hrweb.enron.com/infozone/holidayCalender/Default.asp
for any calendar concerns.

I apologize for any confusion this may have generated.

January 2002 apparently was printed incorrectly also.

"Security Bulletin","
The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

I am working with Lou on the Gomez Title V issue.  We are preparing a submittal to the TNRCC to void the Title V permit (Permit No. O-00754) for the gas processing facilities.  Lou wanted to see if you knew whether the gas processing equipment operated after 1995.  If if didn't operate, did it have the potential to operate? Was the equipment flanged off, shut down, removed from the site, etc.?

"RE: Draft NYISO Statement On External ICAP from ISO-NE","
JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:




ISO-NE has a filing pending at FERC to eliminate their ability to recall
energy from Resources selling ICAP into NY.  If FERC approves the filing,
the ISO will accept up to 350 MW of ICAP from the ISO-NE control area,
subject to the maximum 2558 MW of Installed Capacity located outside the
NYCA in accordance with Attachment B of the Installed Capacity Manual.
Installed Capacity in this context will be in the form of the ICAP
equivalent of the qualified Unforced Capacity (UCAP) sold, consistent with
the ICAP equivalent calculations in Attachment J of the ICAP Manual.

ISO-NE has requested an effective date for its filing of October 22 so FERC
is not expected to approve the ISO-NE tariff changes before then. The next
ICAP Supplier and LSE certifications are due to the NYISO on October 23.
The deficiency auction is scheduled on October 25. In accordance with the
last paragraph of Section 4.9.3 of the ICAP Manual, the ISO plans to open
the period for requesting such rights at 8:00 a.m. on October 18 and close
the request period at 5:00 p.m on October 22. This request period is
conditioned on a timely approval of the elimination of
recall rights by ISO-NE.

Resources located in New England (as well as PJM or HQ) that want to
qualify as ICAP Suppliers in New York must comply with the equirements set
forth in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.9 of the ICAP Manual. The NYISO
encourages Resources to submit DMNC test results, Operating Data and other
required information as soon as possible to allow their participation in
the ICAP market if and when the Commission approves the elimination of the
recall procedures in New England.

"Re: FW: Nostradamus' prediction on WW3..................","
Nostradamus is weak.  However, this Do-stradamus guy is the real deal.  He stuff is absolutely amazing... 
Some of you may have seen this already, but it's eerily precise...  
""In da year of da new c-note and 9 (mm) months, from da sky be comin' a King Kong of Terrorocitication...Da sky be burnin' at Colt 45 degrees.  Fire be approachin' da New Jack City...""  
"" In da city where Jay-Z be big pimpin', shizzit be goin' down. Duncan/Robinson duo be gettin' busted up, yo. While da fo' -tress (not to be confused wit da ""three"" - tress) be fallin' and can't get up, da ghetto-fabulous Big Pimp shall reprezent. East coast/West coast thug-life be on."" 
From the Book of Do-stradamus  
c-note = one hundred = century  
9mm - 9 = September  
Colt 45 - 45 = NY is located at the 45 degree Latitude (and a lot of bros from da hood enjoy drinking Colt 45)  
Big Pimpin' in da... = NYC  
Duncan/Robinson of (San Antonio Spurs) = Twin Towers  
Fo' - tress = Pentagon (this probably should have been Five-tress, but Do-stradamus was close enough)  
Big Pimp = Jay-Z, who lives in da U.S.  
East coast/West coast = war

"results of this week's football pool","Hello Everyone,

	We had a few upsets this week, with some games missed by quite a few people. No one correctly picked Georgia
defeating #7 Tennessee. Oklahoma/TX game was mixed, many people missed Ohio St. beating Northwestern and the only non-top 25 game was mixed, with many people taking Southern Miss, as Memphis won 22-17. In the pros, many people picked Atlanta over the Bears incorrectly, San Diego over Cleveland was missed by most people, Arizona upsetting the Eagles was not good for just about everyone, Seattle beating Jacksonville was not picked by most people and Tampa Bay defeating Green Bay was also missed by most. Through all that, Joe Step did only get 5 incorrect picks and has won this weeks pool already. I came close with 6 wrong, but we both have St. Louis tonight. We had 33 entries this week, the most we've ever had, even back to last season, good job!! Therefore Joe won $66. Below is each person with the number of games they missed this week.

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

"TEESSIDE POWER STATION INCIDENT UPDATE","
Earlier this evening, the police were able to confirm to Enron that all of our employees who tragically died or were injured as a result of yesterday's explosion have now been identified.  This means we are now in a position to give you some information about the members of staff:


Graeme White
Graeme, 37, is in a stable condition at Middlesbrough General Hospital.  He has worked as an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station since October 1999.  Graeme lives in Billingham and is separated with two children.

Paul Surtees 
Paul was Engineering & Maintenance Manager at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in 1992.   He was divorced with a young daughter and lived in Hawthorn, County Durham.  Paul died in Middlesbrough General Hospital earlier today.  He was 40.

Andrew Sherwood
Andrew was an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in March 1999.  He lived with his partner in Hartlepool.  Andrew died at the scene yesterday. He was 36.

Darren Higgins
Darren was also an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in October 1997.  He was unmarried and lived in Normanby near Middlesbrough.  Darren died at the scene yesterday.  He was 28 and leaves a young son living in Poland.


We are continuing to offer as much support as possible to the families of these employees, as well as their friends and colleagues at the plant and associated sites across Enron.

We understand that the last twenty-four hours have been extremely traumatic for everyone concerned. We appreciate there are many questions that remain unanswered, but for the moment our thoughts and prayers are with those we have lost and their families and friends.

We will communicate more information about the incident as it becomes available.

"Announcing Outlook Web Access for Houston Outlook Users","Attention: Houston-based Outlook Users
The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday July 16th, Houston-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook. 
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example:
Username: jdoe4
Password: ********
Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston mail server.

If you have any questions, please call:

Resolution Center at x31411 or
	ETS Solutions Center at x54745

      I have spoke with Richard Stallings (Cubix) this morning and I will receive a fax copy of the corrected test data for unit 703, station 7.  This revised information will support the 96 % torque load on this unit opposed to the 68 %.  I will get Larry and the Mountainair team a faxed copy, we need to make certain that we dispose of any of the information that supports the 68 % test data.

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of ""icap"" as a product (including any ""reserve type"" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on ""Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets.""

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

"NYISO - MIS OUTAGE - October 17, 2001","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants

On October 17, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible
as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.  Ultimately,
these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative
or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You
 Customer Relations

"Rockland Electric Transfer to PJM","On October 17, 2001 Rockland Electric Company and PJM filed with FERC a joint application for the transfer of operational control from the NYISO to PJM of certain facilities located in Northern New Jersey.  The facilities are the transmission assets in the Eastern Division of Rockland's service territory.  This includes approximately 400 MW of load in Bergen County, NJ and transmission facilities that are already directly interconnected with PJM (note that other Rockland facilities located in NJ, namely those in northern Passaic County and Sussex County (Rockland's Central and Western Divisions respectively) will not be transferred to PJM and will remain under the operational control of the NYISO since these facilities are not directly interconnected with PJM nor with Rockland's Eastern Division).  The filing requests approval of the transfer by November 30, 2001 which would allow PJM to take operational control on February 1, 2002 (the filing does not address what, if any, changes to the operation date might be if FERC does not approve this by Nov 30).  Rockland Electric is a subsidiary of Orange & Rockland Utilities which is a subsidiary of Con Edison.

The transfer adds approximately 400 MW of load and 56,000 customers (mostly residential and commercial) to PJM.  There is no increase in supply, therefore the total load of PJM is increased by 400 MW without any additional resources.  The transmission assets include 138-kV (8.3 miles), 69-kV (35.9 miles) and 35-kV (12.4 miles) transmission lines and 11 substations (the filing includes a detailed description of these assets).

Let me know if you require any additional information.

"FW: Summary RTO Week Day 2 -- Planning & Expansion","

 


  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

"Neptune Project order (ER01-2099)","	On July 26, 2001, FERC issued an order conditionally approving the proposed tariff for the Neptune Project, which will consist of several thousand miles of undersea high-voltage direct current transmission systems connecting Main, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to the capacity-constrained markets of Maine, New York City, Long Island and Connecticut.  As a merchant transmission facility, Neptune proposed to assume all the risk of the the project.  It proposed rates effectively capped by market forces.

	Conditions on the Commission's approval:  

		- Neptune must join an RTO adjacent to or containing the geographic area of its proposed faciliteis and must place operational control of its facilities under the RTO.

		- Service must be provided pursuant to the Order No 888 pro forma tariff (Commission denied Neptune's request for a waiver).

		- Neptune cannot negotiate bilateral transactions prior to conducting its open season; it must make all capacity available solely through the open season process.

If you would like any further information, please let me know.

-----Original Message-----
From: Kirkpatrick, Joe
Sent: Tuesday, July 24, 2001 2:52 PM
To: 'market_relations@nyiso.com'; nyiso_tech_exchange@global2000.net
Subject: RE: just checking..first one never went out


Pre-contingency voltage limits have to be respected in order to validate
any existing interface limits.

As far as I can remember (the memory is the second thing to go)
stability limits are calculated using offline studies. Minimum voltage
limits are part of the study parameters, any voltages experienced in the
R/T that are below the minimum voltage limits used in the offline study
invalidates the stability limits. In other words if you cannot respect
the minimum voltage limits the stability limits are rendered invalid,
system operators do not know if the system can withstand the worst
system contingency as there has been no study to validate the limits at
that new low system voltage.

If a system voltage limit measured at a bus is below the minimum voltage
limit you must increase the bus voltage to the minimum voltage limit,
this is beyond SCD, and I suspect BME and SCUC (to some degree).

If the software cannot resolve the problem then a manual request for
generation or OOM request must be made to resolve it.

That aside the OOM issue is one that needs to be resolved. Some
generation needs to be dispatched OOM to resolve for system problems
that SCD or BME cannot resolve (inherent software deficiencies and
modelling problems), the big question is how do you discern between
legitimate OOM generation requests and other requests that are highly
suspect.

JULY BIRTHSTONE: RUBY
=============================
Prized through out the ages, even by kings, ruby is the red
variety of the mineral corundum.  Historically, it has been
symbolic of love and passion, considered to be an aid to firm
friendship, and believed to ensure beauty.  Today's birthstone
for July, ruby's color ranges from purplish or bluish red to a
yellowish red.  The finest color is a vivid, almost pure
spectral red with a very faint undertone of blue, as seen in
Burmese rubies, which are considered the finest among serious
collectors.  Other sources of fine ruby are Thailand, Vietnam,
Cambodia, Kenya, Tanzani, and Azad Kashmir in Pakistan.  The
ruby is very brilliant and very hard.  It is also very durable
and wearable, characteristics that make it an unusually fine
choice for any piece of jewelry.

Translucent varieties of ruby are also seen, and one variety
exhibits a six-ray star effect when cut as a cabochon.  This
variety is called star ruby and is one of nature's most
beautiful and interesting gifts.  But, as with so many other
beautiful gifts once produced only in nature, these lovely gems
are now duplicated in synthetic star rubies and other
numerous ""fake"" rubies.  The newest laboratory-grown synthetic
rubies , like those made by Ramaura and Chatham, are so close
to natural in every aspect that many are passing as genuine.
Be cautious of bargains and when in doubt with a significant
purchase, request colored gemstone report from a major gem-
testing laboratory.

COLOR, BRILLIANCE, AND FIRE
=============================================
What at first glance looks like the color of a diamond is
really a combination of bodycolor, brilliance and dispersion.
Each is affected by both the basic nature of the diamond
crystal and the cutting proportions selected by the cutter.

When gem professionals speak of color, they usually mean
bodycolor, the basic color of an object.  It results from
selective absorption, which causes most of what we normally
think of color.  This is how it works: All white light is a
balanced blend of different colors of light.  When white light
is reflected by, or passes through, an object, the object may
absorb (or subtract) some of the colors; we see the remaining
blend as the object's bodycolor.  Bodycolor in a diamond can
best be seen looking at the diamond sideways against a white
piece of paper.

Brilliance is the total amount of light returned to the eye
by reflections from within the stone and from the surface.
When light strikes the surface of a gem, part of it is
reflected immediately and part of it enters the stone.  The
part reflected from the surface is the external component
of brilliance.  Cutter try to fashion gems so the back
facets create an internal mirror effect, reflecting light
that comes in from above to bounce back out through the top
of the stone.  This is the internal component of brilliance
that is largely responsible for the brightness and ""life""
of the stone.

Dispersion, or fire, is a spreading and separating of
white light into its component, spectral hues.  Prisms
produce the most familiar examples of dispersion.  Diamonds
are more dispersive than most gems.

While a D color diamond will have no bodycolor, it can
show a great deal of color due to brilliance and
dispersion.  Because of the mirror effect, a diamond will
reflect the colors of its mountings, as well as the walls,
lights, and anything else around.  Likewise the bright
flashes of color in a diamond are likely the rainbow colors
resulting from the dispersion.


CODE OF LOVE
===================
For those who want to keep their private life private, to
declare their love covertly, Glasgow, Scotland, jeweler Eric N.
Smith has the answer: a range of bespoke luxury jewelry
embedded with round and rectangular diamonds which, like dots
and dashes, spell out messages in Morse code, the Financial
Times (FT) reports.

Morse code invented by American Samuel Morse in 1837, and for
years the international language for distress at sea has been
replaced by satellite technology. But an estimated 50 million
people worldwide are still familiar with it, and Smith thinks
there's a lot of mileage in his brainchild.

A keen amateur yachtsman qualified in Morse, Smith had the idea
while doing sketches for a new collection last year. It struck
him that the sequence of round and rectangular stones bore a
striking similarity to Morse code's dots and dashes.

Experimenting on a ring with the Morse equivalent of the word
""Always,"" he found it possible to fit the required number of
diamonds on the gold band, and the covert collection was born.

Smith generally embeds diamonds in yellow and white gold, to
create unique rings, bangles, pendants, earrings and cufflinks.
Because each piece is made to order, any precious stone and
metal combination is possible. A copy of the Morse translation
is also provided with each piece, so the recipient gets the
message.

There are people for whom even Morse is not obscure enough. ""One
client from Los Angeles has a wife who loves unraveling ciphers,
secret messages and that sort of thing,"" says Smith. ""He was on
the internet looking for a gift, saw our website and ordered a
ring with a message, part of the surprise being that she has to
work out what the symbols are in the first place - and then what
they mean.""

Prices start at ?500 ($686 U.S.). If you want to cut the expense,
it's best to pick phrases heavy on the letter E, which in Morse is
represented by a single dot, the least expensive symbol to
replicate.


NATIONAL MUSEUM GEMS
==============================================
Curators at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of
Natural History are in the early stages of preparing an
exhibition, tentatively titled ""Gemstones of the World,"" for
its grand opening here in the spring of 2004. After eight
months, the exhibit will take off on a three-year tour of the
country's major natural history museums, unleashing a wealth
of facts and fables about colored stones on the public.

The National Museum of Natural History is the most visited
museum in the world, with 10 million visitors annually. The
Hall of Gems gets about 80 percent of that traffic because
most people make a beeline straight for the Hope Diamond, the
most viewed object in the world with twice as many looks as
the Mona Lisa.



THE AWESOME ASSCHER CUT
====================================
In recent months we have noticed a definite increase in
demand for the once obscure Asscher cut diamond.

The Asscher cut was inspired by the table cuts of the
Renaissance, however, it was a big departure from the
brilliant cuts that dominated the 1800s and was a
forerunner of the standard emerald cut. Because of its high
crown and small table, the Asscher cut has more light and
fire than an emerald cut.

Check out the following internet address for excellent
background article on the Asscher cut and a photo of a
9.46 carat Asscher cut diamond ring.

WORLD WIDE DIAMOND SALES DOWN
====================================
De Beers said its rough diamond sales in the first half of the
year was $2.62 billion, a 26% drop from last year's record high.
The company says the downturn is due to a global economic
slowdown and falling demand in the United States, the world's
biggest market for the cut and polished stones used in jewelry.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Diamond Source of Virginia is looking for ways to reach
potential diamond buyers.  Our marketing challenge is that
these shoppers usually keep it a secret until they have made a
purchase and presented the gift.  This is your chance to win
Free Diamond Jewelry for providing great marketing ideas.

CLARITY GRADING GUIDELINES
================================
There are no absolute rules that make a particular diamond fall
into one clarity grade or another.  Because every diamond is
unique and there is an endless variety of ""clarity pictures""
just like every snowflake is different, each stone must be
judged on its own merits.

The more diamonds one looks at, the easier it becomes to judge
which clarity grade a stone falls in.  The general steps for
clarity grading are as follows:

1) Clean the stone.  Dust particles will likely be larger than
most inclusions so the cleaner the stone, the easier it is to
see the inclusions.
2) Examine the stone face up with a 10x magnification and
preferably with a microscope with darkfield illumination.
3) Note your first impression of the severity of its
inclusions.  The first call is usually the most accurate.
4) Examine the stone from the side, around the girdle and
through the crown and pavilion.  Note all characteristics
including size, number, position, nature, color, and relief.
5) Review the stone face-up and assign a general clarity
classification.  If you have to look for quite a while (with
10x magnification) to find any inclusions, consider VVS.  If
it takes a few seconds to find the inclusions, it is
probably VS.  If you notice them immediately, SI seems likely.
If they are obviously eye-visible, the stone probably merits
an I grade.
6) Make the distinction between VVS1-VVS2, VS1-VS2, SI1-SI2,
or I1-I2-I3 as needed.
7) Call the grade.  If you study too much, your intial gut
feel which is usually right, tends to get clouded by analysis.



PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:

"Outlook Communication","Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our email environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that we have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues. 
?	During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exchange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug, which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the better part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which appears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchange servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug.
?	Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experienced database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Outlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchange servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected server.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use -- we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems with the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the business week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to move users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impacted users could not access their e-mail.
?	During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and dangerous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against viruses that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktops.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day.  The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but we believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron computing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this time, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as the performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to get better.
There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the last few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and meet Enron's business needs and expectations.

"Condensate Throughput Request","The Environmental Affairs Department is developing a list of ETS natural gas pipeline facilities where the  condensate throughput exceeds 30,000 gallons/year.  In the coming weeks, the Division Environmental Specialists will be asking your operating teams for annual condensate throughput at all facilities.  Please impress upon the teams the importance of collecting and providing this information as we have committed to a first quarter 2002 deadline to compile the list.  This request is especially critical in areas prior to processing as the likelihood of the annual condensate throughput to exceed 30,000 gallons/year increases in those areas.

"April 2001 Advisory Statement Mapping","Market Participants:

There is one correction to the version mapping below.  April 4, 2001 should
be Version 4 minus Version 1.  This was one day when we had an overwrite
problem.  The version 1 for this day is what ties out to the original bill
and supplemental invoice.  The supplemental invoice consisted of changes on
4/4, 4/10, 4/11, 4/13, and 4/18 through 4/30.

Subject:  FW: Riddle from Paul Harvey

Here is a pretty neat little thing from  Paul Harvey.




See if you can guess the riddle at the  end.
Paul Harvey Writes: We tried so hard to  make things better for our kids
that
we made them worse. For my grandchildren,  I'd like better. I'd really like
for them to know about hand me down  clothes and homemade ice cream and
leftover meat loaf sandwiches, I really  would.
I hope you learn humility by being  humiliated, and that you learn honesty
bybeing  cheated.
I hope you learn to make your own bed and  mow the lawn and wash the car.
And
I really hope nobody gives you a brand new  car when you are sixteen.
It will be good if at least one time you  can see puppies born and your old
dog put to sleep.
I hope you get a black eye  fighting for something you believe in, I hope
you
have to share a bedroom with  your younger brother. And it's all right
ifyou
have to draw a line down the middle of the  room, but when he wants to
crawl
under the covers with you because he's  scared, I hope you let him.

 When  youwant to see a movie and your  little brother wants to tag along,
I hope  you'll let  him.
I hope you have to walk uphill to school  with your friends and that you
live
in a town where you can do it safely. On  rainy days when you have to catch
a
ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to  drop you two blocks away so you
won't be seen riding with someone as  uncool as your Mom. If you want a
slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how  to make one  instead of buying
one.

I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and  read books.
When you learn to use computers, I hope  you also learn to add and subtract
in your head.

I hope you get teased by your  friends when you have your first crush on a
girl, and when you talk back to your  mother that you learn what ivory soap
tastes like.

May you skin your knee  climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove and
>stick your tongue on a  frozen flagpole.

I don't care if you try a beer once, but I  hope you don't like it. And if
a
friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope  you realize he is not your
friend.
I sure hope you make time to  sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go
fishing with your  Uncle.
May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy  during the holidays.
I hope your mother punishes you when you  throw a baseball through your
neighbor's window and that she hugs you  and kisses you at Christmas time
when you give her a plaster mold of your  hand. These things I wish for you
-
tough times and disappointment, hard work  and happiness.  To me, it's the
only way to appreciate life. Written with  a pen.  Sealed with a kiss.  I'm
here for you.  And if I die before  you do, I'll go to heaven and wait for
you. Paul Harvey

When asked this riddle, 80% of  kindergarten kids got the answer, compared
to
17% of Stanford University  seniors.

What is greater than God,  More evil than the devil, The poor have it, The
rich need it, and if you eat  it, you'll die?
>Send this to 10 people and then push  the shift key, it will give you the
answer. P.S. You wont believe this, but  this really does give you the
answer!!

"NYISO Market Participant change - 1st Rochdale Cooperative, LTD","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants

1st Rochdale Cooperative. Ltd. is being removed from the
NYISO-administered electric energy markets.  The changeover
of 1st Rochdale's customers to the provider of last resort,
Consolidated Edison Company of New York, will take place on
Friday, October 12 for the Saturday, October 13th market.
1st Rochdale had previously posted a sufficient amount of
collateral to cover its obligations to the energy market and
the NYISO anticipates, therefore, that no losses associated
with this transition will be borne by the market.

Regards,
Customer Relations

""Kirkpatrick, Joe"" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

This is great stuff..

Since Strategic sees the value in having this 'valuable' call option. I
would suggest that they value the put option on the load contracts being
served and rebate their customers accordingly.
Include the obvious DAM to R/T arbitrage as optionality also, the
options thay hold are hourly and therefore are much more valuable.

I look forward to the rebates being sent to their customers.

If a GT so valuable go buy one or build one.

The settlements curently posted for September 28-Version 2 & 29-Version 1,
2001 are not accurate due to problems encountered with some data files for
those dates.  As a result, some customer balancing energy is incorrect and
residual adjustments for those dates are artificially inflated.  The NYISO
will be re-running those billing dates as soon as it is feasible to do so.
The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience caused by this problem.

"November & December 1999 Settlement Adjustments","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants:

On the November 1999 & December 1999 Transmission Customer Monthly
Statements many customers have noted under the ""Energy Settlement"" section
for ""Forward Energy"" a change in MW-Hrs with no associated change in dollar
amounts.  This is because of a correction in the sign convention for the
MW-Hrs related to external generation transactions (transactions from a
proxy bus to the NYISO reference bus).  For all other types of transactions
the NYISO charges customers the appropriate TUC or LBMP  based on the MWs
that flowed, but for external generation transactions, customers receive
payments from the NYISO, and therefore these types of transactions have an
opposite sign convention.

The dollars associated with the external generation transactions have
always had the proper sign convention, but the MW-Hrs have not.  On
01/17/2000 this sign convention was corrected for all billing months going
forward resulting in the correct MW-Hr values being reported from February
2000 to date.  However, November 1999 - January 2000 did not have the
proper MW-Hrs reported on the Transmission Customer Monthly Statements.
With the latest settlement adjustments posted the MW-Hrs are being
corrected with the proper sign convention.  Transmission Customers will see
similar changes in their forward energy MW-Hrs for January 2000's
settlement adjustment.

If you have any questions please contact your Customer Relations
representative at 518-356-6060.

"Solicitation for the position of Vice-Chairperson of the NYISO Operating Committee","
MRyanTaber@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Solicitation of Credentials from Candidates
   for the position of Vice-Chairperson of the NYISO Operating Committee
          for a one-year term from December 2001 ? November 2002

     The Nominating Committee of the NYISO Operating Committee is seeking
qualified individuals willing to serve as Vice-Chairperson of the

     The scope of responsibilities of the Operating Committee can be found
in Article 8 of the ISO Agreement.  As specified in the Agreement, the
Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson will serve a one-year term, and the
Vice-Chairperson will become the Chairperson following the completion of
the Chairperson's term.  The Agreement further specifies that the
individuals elected to these positions may not be active in the same sector
as the Chair of their Committee, nor may they be representatives of members
that occupy the Chairperson or Vice Chairperson positions of the Business
Issues Committee or Management Committee.
     These provisions, at this time, preclude representatives of the
following companies or their affiliates and representatives from the
following sector from consideration for Vice-Chairperson for the upcoming
term:
?    Transmission Owners
?    Niagara Mohawk
?    Con Ed Solutions
?    New York Power Authority

     The Nominating Committee will review the credentials of the presenting
candidates and may screen the pool.  However, the Nominating Committee is
required (pursuant to the OC By-Laws) to bring at least  one qualified
candidate before the Operating Committee for election.
     Therefore, the Nominating Committee requests that interested
individuals, who are not representatives of the members or sectors listed
above, to present the following material by 5:00 pm, October 4, 2001.

?    A current resume
?    Brief answers to the following questions:
1.   Please describe all experience you have had in chairing groups or
committees of diverse interests, with a list of such groups.
2.   Please describe the support of your organization for your assuming the
position of Vice-Chairperson, and describe your ability to make the
necessary time commitment.
3.   Please describe any training or experience you have had in mediation,
ADR or consensus building.
4.   Please describe briefly why you would like to have this job.
5.   Please describe briefly your organizations actual and/or potential
business interests in the Northeast and New York State, including the
sector in which your organization participates for purposes of NYISO

"NYISO - TCC - October TCC Reconfiguration Auction - Notice of Delay and New Bidding Period","
GWilliams@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The October TCC Reconfiguration Auction bids and offers were received on
Monday (9/10).  On Wednesday (9/12) at least one Market Participant asked
to adjust its bids based on Tuesday's tragic events in New York City,
citing a material change in circumstances.   The NYISO has determined that
it would be inappropriate to allow one Market Participant to change its
bids at this time, but recognizes that the circumstances upon which all
bids were based may have changed.   Therefore, the NYISO has decided to
delay posting of auction results for the October TCC Reconfiguration
Auction to allow each Market Participant an opportunity to review its bids
and offers and, if deemed appropriate, adjust them.  All bids and offers
received on Monday will be invalidated.  Market Participants may submit
their bids and offers during the new Bidding Period scheduled for Friday
(9/14).  The revised schedule for the October TCC Reconfiguration Auction
is as follows:

September 14, 2001 - The Bidding Period opens at 8:00 AM and closes at 5:00
PM.

September 17 - 20, 2001 - The NYISO will conduct the required award
analysis for this auction.

September 21, 2001 - The NYISO will post the results of this auction.
Buyers who were awarded TCCs will be notified by the NYISO using email no
later than 5:00 PM.

September 25, 2001 - The NYISO distributes Award Notices to purchasers and
sellers of TCCs.

September 27, 2001 - Any dispute regarding an Award Notice must be
submitted in writing to the NYISO by 5:00 PM.

September 28, 2001 - Payments due to NYISO by 5:00 PM for TCCs awarded.

October 3, 2001 - The NYISO makes payment for all TCCs sold during the
October Reconfiguration Auction.

October 5, 2001 - The NYISO distributes any residual auction revenues from
the October Reconfiguration Auction to the Transmission Owners.


The schedule for the remainder of the Autumn 2001 Initial TCC Auction is
unaffected.

"FALL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK MEETING","
WChiume@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:


THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK MEETING
Presentation by Economy.com


The NYISO Analysis & Planning Department is pleased
to announce the next Economic Outlook Meeting scheduled
for October 18, 2001. The meeting will be at the NYISO
facilities:

     290 Washington Avenue Extension
     Albany, NY 12203

There will be lunch at NOON. The meeting starts at
12.45 PM.

Dr. Celia Chen and Dr. Steve Cochran from Economy.com
will present the outlook for New York, Northeast and U.S.
economies. The meeting is open to any market participant
interested in attending.

I encourage market participants to attend this meeting
particularly given the current 'uncertainty' on where the
economy is heading. The presentations will cover a
broad range of issues, including:

?    will the interest rate cuts help?
?    was the tax cut sufficient, or 'timely?'
?    how are the New York metro economies doing?
?    the impact of the stock market on New York, and
?    what are the implications of the global economic
     slowdown to the U.S. economy?

The last meeting in March was vibrant and insightful.
I anticipate the same for the next one, so mark your
calendars. Also, send me any questions that you

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

"RE:  Sept. 24 ICAPWG Mtg","
""Kirkpatrick, Joe"" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The example contained in the presentation with regard to the cost of
ICAP to Customers is while sound in theory contains misleading and
totally inaccurate information with regard to the cost of a GT.

The capital cost of the GT in the example is $2.5 M for a 25 MW GT or
$100 per KW. If the author can build GTs in NYC for $100 per KW then
please contact us and we will secure your services.

I can cite NYPA's investment of well over $500 million for 450 MW for a
cost of $1100 per KW.

The cost to build GTs in NYC are closer to $1000/KW or 10 times the
value represented in the example.
The O&M costs are also at some sort of serious discount to reality.

If examples are to be cited then let's get them closer to the real
world.

addition, I've attached the most recent Order in the Southeast RTO case.

"S&P Mtg re: BME/RT Issues","
scheije@selectenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

I apologize for the larger circulation of this email than to just the S&P
WG.

The MC last week urged a rapid consideration of the interactions between
BME and SCD and their related prices from the hot, high load days of July
24 and 25.

To pursue this there is additional information needed from the ISO. Below
is a preliminary list I compiled that would be useful in assessing the
situation.

Data should be provided for relevant hours i.e. those with high BME or RT
prices or both. Particularly for those hours with binding reserve
constraints in HA or RT.

1 RT reserve levels in each hour (it is recognized that the value
fluctuates but the the point is to get an idea of apporximately how short
the ISO was of reserves, if at all)

2 Similar information should be obtained for our neighbors; PJM, NE and
IMO. Also, could the ISO describe what the others do hour ahead to prepare
for the next operating hour under circumstances such as we encountered
those two days? NY has the unfortunate position of producing prices related
to decisions for which it pays otherwise - what were our neighbors doing?

3 An accounting, by hour, of reserves carried on exports out of NY

4 Identification of any non-ICAP based exports that may have been counted
for reserve; this shouldn't happen as it puts non-ICAP providers in the
position of being recalled...

5 BME reserve deficiencies by hour; were the reserve levels always met,
albeit at extreme prices, or was the ISO unable to cover the requirements
in advance?

6 Based on Mike Calimano's report, there were ""a couple hundred Mws"" of
operating units not seen by BME; this situation needs to be (1) confirmed
and (2) explained and corrected

The following are sort of 2nd tier questions:

1 If the ISO was short of reserves in RT why weren't the EDRP resources,
who were notified, not called into play to aid in curing the deficiency?
There should have been no economic judgement call by operators (if the
first two hours were at $500 that was likely cheaper than what BME was
taking in if the BME prices applied to settlement under ECA B). BME made no
judgement call when its prices spiked due to the 30 M NSR scarcity and took
available imports.

2 What would have been the System State(s) if the reserve margins had been
held in RT (assuming ISO was short in RT)? Would this have forced a Major
Emergency and subsequent voltage reductions, public appeals etc? Had this
been done would have the EDRP Mws been activated?

I would also like to offer the following as potential changes to be
considered. They are based on the limited discussions that have taken place
so far.

1 Include exports that are being counted as reserve in BME as it evaluates
its reserve position. Since BME is deciding which transactions will be
scheduled, operators would need to indicate which transactions and how many
Mws could be counted in RT as reserves. The implications for the solution
algorithm are unclear - can BME recognize the additional reserves thus
carried? Would it result in fewer imports and lower BME prices? What if the
reserve requirements used as input to BME were manipulated downward for
reserves on exports? What happens if BME did not schedule the export(s)?

2 Subject to the ISO providing detailed RT reserve info, it seems that the
reserves should be carried in RT and that SCD should not be allowed to
dispatch with units that were not available to BME (thus resulting in the
large price disparities). If the ISO had adequate reserves in RT, SCD
should not be allowed to produce RT price reductions relative to what BME
is doing. However, having said this, if there are no energy resources to
maintain reserve levels AND the ISO needs to maintain its regulation room,
the next thing to go is load. To my long understanding, we do not shed load
to avoid shedding load (at least not to maintain reserves...)

Perhaps if BME has some adjustments and the missing Mws are accounted for,
little needs to be done in RT. (This does not mean that SCD handles GTs
correctly - that is still a commit problem it is incapable of resolving...)

3 At one point, we had approved use of BME prices to settle all HA
transactions. This approach was scuttled by the ISO when they discovered
that there were persistent, unidirectional price differences between the
proxy busses and their connected in-NY zones. We then retreated to
automating what is done under ECA B; substituting BME prices only under
constrained ramp or ATC conditions.

The ISO should review this again. Does the price difference remain,
inviting gaming? If so, is there a way for the MMU to watch for or prevent
inappropriate opportunistic behavior? A full, partial 3rd settlement would
lessen the sting of HA prices that are out of synch with RT.

4 The ISO should review the multipliers in the LP solution that insure that
energy, then regulation and then the 3 types of reserve are maintained.
They should be no more than required for a proper solution outcome. Prices
at $65000 are not necessary and misleading (while mathematically
correct...). Also, if we are to consider settling transactions at BME
prices, such an outcome would result in considerable opposition...

5 Another non-controversial change would be to extend the DADRP
participants to hour ahead evaluation. In the instant circumstance, it is
likely that BME would have chosen some of those loads opposed to imports
(there was no congestion so some of those western loads might have looked
pretty good...). Since there is the issue that the DADRP is subsidized, I
would propose that, if extended to BME, that the DA bids be used for BME
evaluation. If nothing else look at it as sending money to companies in
NYS.

"NYISO - MIS Outage - October 17, 2001 - Reminder Notice","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:


*****Reminder Notice************

Dear Market Participants

On October 17, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible
as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.  Ultimately,
these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You
Customer Relations

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"Solicitation Calls","Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, ""I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?""

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

"Enron Board Elects New Corporate Secretary","I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel.

Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant.

Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.  

Please join me in congratulating Paula on her new responsibilities and in wishing Rebecca well in her future endeavors.

"RTO Meeting tidbits","
Aaron Breidenbaugh <aaron@global2000.net> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

For those that are interested, although no scheduling order has been
issued yet by Judge Young in the Northeast RTO case, a quick glance at
FERC's Hearing Room reservation page
(http://www.ferc.gov/public/isd/daysched.htm) indicates that Hearing
Rooms 1 and 2 are reserved by Judge Young for Northeast RTO Mediations
on July 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, and 31.

Of course the fact that the rooms are reserved does not necessarily mean
that meetings will be held on all of those days. Nevertheless, parties
might be well advised to pack for more than just one overnight next
week, just in case....

Also, as a number of folks have expressed interest in the same question,
I provide the following. On behalf of the Price Responsive Load
Coalition, I have asked Judge Young to provide guidance on whether new
parties will be admitted to the mediation and, if so, whether they can
request party status at the meeting on the 24th. I will share whatever
guidance I receive with this list.

Aaron

Paul:

The estimated trans loss charges for August have been entered (NE Hourly # 700778.3 @ ; NE Phys # 700783.3).  They're unusually high due to the increase in deal volumes as well as inflated prices due to extreme heat (08/06 thru 08/10 in particuar).  If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to come by and discuss with me or Rebecca.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"Stage 2 Manual Add'l changes","Attached are a few changed pages of the Stage 2 ICAP Manual , to be approved
at the July 19 BIC meeting. All these changes were made as result of ICAP
Working Group deliberations over the past two weeks. They are summarized
here:

> Section 4.4.11 - This new sub-section addresses Generators that
> temporarily may not wish to sell or certify their UCAP.  Without this
> language,  those Generators would have been considered forced out.
>
> Section 4.6 - The second paragraph is new and clarifies the result of
> outages which occur beyond the step-up transformer, and including such
> step-up transformer.  If these outages occur at a time when a Generator
> has not placed its unit on a maintenance outage, such interruption in
> availability shall be treated as a reserve shutdown for purposes of
> calculating that Generator's EFORD.
>
> Section 5.5 - Language describing the roll-over characteristics of UCAP
> bids from the first phase of an auction to the second phase of that same
> auction has been struck because the ICAPWG deemed it confusing.
>
>
In addition, a motion for approval of the Stage 2 ICAP Manual, including
these additional changes, is
attached.

If you have questions, please contact John Charlton at the NYISO, Howard
Fromer, chair of the ICAPWG,

"RE: NYISO - TCC - Autumn 2001 Initial TCC Auction - Notice of Roc	kland Electric Company Separation from NYCA","
""Depillo, Raymond V."" <Raymond.Depillo@pseg.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In regard to the message below, I was wondering if there is anyone out there
could shed some light on a few questions.

1.  Where could one go to find information on the Rockland Electric
reconfiguration (FERC filings or even just information updates)?
2.  Why was this not an issue in any of the longer term auctions?  Don't we
now have very inconsistent treatment across the various TCC auctions?
3.  When exactly will this happen?  Since I have yet to see a filing, can we
assume this will be done by November?  If not, it is obvious this move will
relieve congestion on Center East, and potentially lead to an
undercollection problem on TCC revenues?  If this is the case, will these
costs be socialized across all loads (TOs), or funded by the entity that
physically called for the removal of the load?
4.  What happens to any of the grandfathered rights (TCCs) associated with
serving this load?  Will the TO that served this load release those to the
market?  Will they just disappear?  Or will the TO be allowed to keep them?
5.  Will this move be coordinated with PJM or can we expect some gaps
between the treatment of the Rockland load between the two ISOs and their
various markets?

Thanks,

Ray

GWilliams@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The five remaining rounds of the Initial Autumn 2001 TCC Auction for
Six-Month TCCs will be conducted with the Rockland Electric Company portion
of Orange & Rockland Utilities, Inc. represented as external to the New
York Control Area (NYCA).  This will reduce the load in Zone G (Hudson
Valley) PTID 61758 by approximately 20 percent.  No individual generator
PTIDs are affected by this change.

"November & December 1999 Settlement Adjustments","
RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO is delaying issuance of the November & December 1999 - 2nd
Settlement Adjustments, scheduled for September 7th, by a week.  The delay
is necessary to make corrections to the re-engineered invoicing process
under which these settlements will be made.

Settlements for November 1999 through March 2000 were ""trued-up"" once under
a process that only adjusted settlements at the hourly interval level.
Upon realizing that the now superseded process was deficient in its ability
to ""true-up"" settlements at the SCD interval level, the process was
completely re-engineered and put into operation in February 2001.

In order to perform the 2nd settlement adjustments [a.k.a. true-ups] for
November through March under the new process, the 1st true-ups of these
months must be reversed to create the billing determinant measurement set
that was used in the 1st true-up.  The newly acquired billing determinants
for the 2nd settlement adjustments will then be netted against the set from
the 1st true-ups.  That delta will then become the amount invoiced for the
2nd settlement adjustment.

This delay is to fix mapping problems observed between the old measurement
set invoicing format and the new measurement set formats.  Invoices will be
issued once the mapping problems have been corrected and we am satisfied
that the settlements can be readily reconciled by our Market Participants.
The NYISO apologizes for this delay and any resultant problems.

Regards,
Randy A. Bowers
Manager - Customer Settlements

Well  respected Management team with over 20 years experience  in Software development, Sales, and Brokerage skills.  [IMAGE]    INVESTMENT  SUMMARY   Over  the last several years? online brokerage firms, on technology  and infrastructure, have invested a lot of money. Several companies  have found it cheaper to BUY other companies then spend the time  and money developing their own technology and infrastructure.  We  believe STTN?s story will get a lot of attention in  the investment community in the coming months, as the stock market  continues to move upward. STTN is a brand-new publicly trading  company via a reverse/merger with Ikon Ventures, Inc.(IKNV). When  we consider STTN, we must understand the business model and  huge potential in the Company?s valuation. Sutton  Trading Solutions Inc. ? Sutton Online Trading Solutions  is an ASP (Application Service Provider) offering turnkey online  trading solutions for domestic and foreign firms. With complete  front-end software, trade routing and back-office management applications,  Sutton Online has become a recognized destination for small, medium  and large brokerages seeking an easy and cost effective entr?e  to the Direct Access trading industry. Sutton Online has developed  a true niche, a special synergy combining state-of-the-art technology  (Level 1 and Level II trading via SONIC 2000?  and GlobalDAT?),  brokerage and clearing arrangements, and high quality services including  website design and hosting and Customer Service to allow both US  and Foreign brokerages to offer Online Trading to their clients.  Sutton Online, Inc. currently has Service Bureau customers in Bahrain,  Russia, The Czech Repbulic, Brussels, Madrid, Brazil, Peru, France,  Bulgaria, and The United States. Sutton Online has received Service  Bureau Status from ECN?s (Electronic Communication Network)  as well as the NASDAQ to provide related services. Sutton Trading  Solutions, Inc. also operates Sutton Data Services in Prague,  Czech Republic. This wholly owned subsidiary specializes in the  development and implementation of custom financial banking and brokerage  applications for both front and back end users..    Online  trading is the fastest growing segment of the brokerage industry  and is expected to continue to grow significantly. IDC estimates  that Online Brokerage revenue will exceed $5.4 Trillion by 2005.  The evolution of the Internet has fundamentally changed the way  in which many investors manage their financial affairs. The speed,  convenience, choice, cost savings and information offered by the  Internet as an investment tool has increasingly driven investor  assets online. The growth of discount brokerage firms and the increasing  utilization of the Internet to access a wide range of financial  services underscore a fundamental shift in market demographics.  This shift has altered the way consumers manage their personal financial  assets. Based on industry research reports and the rapid consumer  acceptance of online transactions, consumers are increasingly taking  direct control over their personal financial affairs, not only because  they are now able to do so, but also because they find it more convenient  and less expensive than relying on financial intermediaries.       KEY  PRODUCTS    GlobalDAT?  Global Direct Access Trading; GlobalDAT? is a unique propietary  technology that connects major European and American Stock Exchanges  and ECN?s through one user interface for share dealing. GlobalDAT??s  open architecture FIX interface provides the ability to add markets  and exchanges on demand. Each user has the ability to view price  quotes(Level 1and 2), route orders via Market Makersand direct connections  to ECN?s and Exchanges, view order statu, P&L, cash flow,  all coupled with dynamic charting and account management and IN  REAL-TIME, while providing the user Front- End enviroment in their  native language.   Sonic  2000? a US based Direct Access Application. SONIC 2000??s  platfom offers trade executions to over 400 Market Makers and 9  ECN?s with dedicated connections to The Island ECN, Archipelago,  NASDAQ, NYSE via SuperDot, and Knight Trimark. Real time data is  provided by Hyperfeed.      VALUATION   In  our opinion, as the story unfolds, and the investment community  becomes aware of STTN?s HUGE upside potential as an  attractive "" Emerging Growth Company"". With STTN  trading today at around $3.00 per share, based on STTN?s  projections, we believe that by fiscal year 2002, STTN will  earn $ 8 Million Dollars on $ 32 Million in gross revenues, or $0.38  cents per share. Applying a conservative multiple of 30 times earnings  (less then STTN?s estimated growth rate), STTN  should be valued at $11.50 per share near term. Looking out to fiscal  year 2003 (which Wall Street Analysts are currently doing) STTN  projects $0.61 cents per share in earnings, using the same price  earnings multiple of 30, this could peg STTN?s stock  at over $18.50 per share over the next 12 months. At STTN?s  current price of around $3.00 per share, STTN appears to  be extremely undervalued, and potentially has HUGE UPSIDE.       SUMMARY   With  lower interest rates, individual investors will seek an alternative  for better returns. In our opinion, the next time around, individual  investors will seek a more even playing field with the ""big  boys"", in executing their trades. Individual investors are  more educated today regarding trade execution and should migrate  to a Direct Access Trading platform such an STTN. This should  make STTN?s business and STTN?s stock much  more valuable in today?s market.

"Adjustments to 7/2000, 8/2000, & 3/2001 Settlement Adjustment Invoices","
RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO will be posting invoices later today for the initial settlements
of July 2001 and the 1st settlement adjustments of July 2000, August 2000,
& March 2001.  Transmission Customers will observe the following
adjustments to their settlements.

Adjustments have been made to Transmission Customers' invoices to recover
the costs related adjustments made to customer settlements outside of the
billing process and to adjust the NYISO clearing account balance to zero
for each month invoiced.

Prior to October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the
revenue received from Schedule 1 charges, which were comprised of
forecasted uplift & residual adjustments, and  the costs actually incurred
by adjusting subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.  In October
2000, the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions
that allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In order to allow any changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be
settled through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in
October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.  This results in
an over-collection which is being returned to Customers through an
adjustment to their monthly balances.  This billing treatment for July 2000
and August 2000 settlement adjustments resulted in credits to the market
totaling $7,700,605.23 and $32,146,310.55, respectively.  Customers where
paid their share of these adjustments based upon their respective ratio
shares of NYISO load for each month.  This adjustment provides for the
settlement of all accounts in the market in the month(s) the costs or
over-collections were realized and adjusts the NYISO clearing account
balance impact to zero for each month.

Adjustments have also been made to Transmission Customers' invoices to
recover the costs related adjustments made to customer settlements outside
of the billing process.  These adjustments totalled $964,548.42 for March
2001, $375,110.49 for July 2000 and $48,973.41 for August 2000. Customers
where allocated their share in these costs based upon their respective
ratio shares of NYISO load for each month.

Regards,
Randy A. Bowers
Manager - Customer Settlements

"April 2000 Advisory Statements","
DCongel@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Market Participants:

New advisory statements for April 2000 have been posted to your secure web
sites as of
8/4/2001.  The reason for the update is due to a printing error in the
previous version for LRR
Uplift charges.

Some of you may have had problems getting the LRR dollars in line with what
you were invoiced
due to this printing error.  It is important to note that the bills were
NOT re-run, just re-printed.

If you have any questions please contact customer relations at
518-356-6060.

"Voltage Limits","
CKing@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Joe, Don,

As Joe indicated in his TIE response, voltage limits and voltage-collapse
limits are studied off-line using detailed AC power-flow techniques.  The
resulting limits (in kV) are translated into a MW transfer limit  for the
flowgates affected by the original voltage limit.  To the extent that these
surrogate limits reflect the expected voltage performance of the system,
then SCUC/BME and SCD will secure the system accordingly.  These rely on DC
powerflow techniques, which by their nature are Blind to voltage problems.
When this occurs, OOM is one tool that can be used to secure the system.

When the realtime operation deviates from the conditions assumed in the
analysis used to determine the voltage limits, the use of OOM and/or other
measures may need to taken by the Operators to secure the system

I hope this clarifys the situation.

Chuck

      meeting


Responding to Tim Lynch's comments:

The BME-SCD Operating Reserve Comparison includes the following note:
""Data for BME hours beginning 0:00 was not reliable, assumed all hours were
not short.""

Please explain why data for this hour each day is unreliable and how it
impacts customer bills.  We are troubled that after operating a system for
nearly two years, problems remain that cause this magnitude of inaccuracy.

Tim Lynch
NYSEG Energy Trading
********************

As was explained at the PITF meeting the footnote in question related to a
data transferral problem between the NYISO and LECG that had NO IMPACT on
the BME prices, schedules or any billing matters.

To collate the data for the PITF meeting in a meaningful way it was
necessary to track the state of the 30 minute reserve constraint i.e. was
BME able to purchase sufficient 30 minute reserves to meet the pool 30
minute reserve requirement. LECG's information for the status of the 30
minute reserve constraint for hour beginning 0:00 was unreliable because of
data tranferral and processing problems so we made the very reasonable
assumption that in the middle of the night there is little chance that we
were reserve short. The footnote was entirely reasonable given the context
of the discussion for which the data was prepared.

Thank-you

"EFCU E-Survey Response","
Enron Federal Credit Union
E-Survey Response

We recently asked you to participate in the EFCU 2001 E-Survey.  More than 3,000 Enron employees took the time to respond to our survey.  Your honest opinions and time are appreciated and will help us continue to bring you products and services that you deem important in your life, as well as the service that you expect.

We are pleased to report these areas where you have had a positive experience (based on Good, Very Good, and Excellent ratings), in comparison to last year's ratings:

				2001	2000
	Friendliness		88%	84%
	Courtesy		89%	84%
	Knowledge/Training	86%	80%
	Range of Services	87%	82%
	Saving Interest Rates	66%	60%
	Loan Interest Rates	65%	58%
	Quality of Service	88%	84%
	Communications	84%	79%
	Web Portal		72%	N/A
	Service Wait Time	79%	68%


Of course, there is always room for improvement.  Based on your written comments, we have determined these areas where we would like to improve:

ATM Access - We are working with various vendors to develop a program that offers you more free ATM access options and hope to be able to offer this program soon.  We will let you know as soon as a program is available.  In the meantime, members are encouraged to get cash one of these ways to avoid fees:

-  Use your VISA Check Card to get cash back at merchants.  These are fee-free transactions.
-  Use our ATM in the lobby of the Enron Building or 3 Allen Center, or try the approximate 100 fee-free ATMs in the Houston area that display the Select ATM logo (visit enronfcu.com for locations).	
-  Visit one of our Service Center branches (visit enronfcu.com for locations).
-  We will also waive our fee on 3 unaffiliated ATM transactions per month.


Phone Accessibility - In January 2001, we established a phone center to answer incoming calls to our main number.  An automated system initially prompts you, but the option to speak to a live operator is available.  Your call may be forwarded to an EFCU representative, and you may get voice mail.  In this instance, we will return your call as soon as possible.

Should you get voice mail, it will help us process your request more efficiently if you leave your name, phone number, member number and the nature of your call.  You may also contact us via e-mail at efcu@enron.com, and we will respond as soon as possible.


Wait Lines - Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we are unable to expand our financial services area (new accounts) right now.  We do recognize that this does at times cause a back up and apologize for the inconvenience.  We are making plans to expand when possible.

We added several tellers this year to help the traffic flow in the teller area and are now filled to capacity at all stations.  As you know, the teller lines are sometimes heavy on paydays.  To help minimize your wait time, here are a few other options to handle your transactions:

-  Make deposits & withdrawals at our ATMs in the Enron Building Lobby or 3 Allen Center.  Deposits are retrieved between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and are posted the same day.
-  Make deposits at our Night Drop Box on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, outside of the EFCU front doors.  The Night Drop Box is checked throughout the day and transactions are posted the same day if received by 5:00 p.m.
-  Sign up for Direct Deposit.  It's convenient, fast and safe.  Go to ehronline.enron.com to sign up.

"Organizational Announcement","
As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

"Computer Virus","
There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.
Enron Global Technology

Dear Market Participants,

Required maintenance work is scheduled on Wednesday, August 22 and
Thursday, August 23 for NYISO servers that host some of the web sites.
This work is scheduled to take place between 7 and 8 am on both days.
Access to customer statements will be interrupted at times on Thursday
morning during that hour.   If you access the Bidding and Scheduling pages

NYISO Market Advisory
Re:  Code Red Worm Computer Virus

Dear NYISO Market Participants:

As many of you are likely aware, there is currently a computer virus named
Code Red Worm making its way around the internet. Through the congestion it
causes, this virus and its variants may significantly impact normal
internet functions. It is projected that a version of this virus is
scheduled to go from dormant to active state sometime this evening
(7/31/2001) and could create problems for anyone using the internet.

Because of the various functions handled over the internet between the New
York Independent System Operator (""NYISO"") and Market Participants, the
NYISO has done everything we can to secure our operations against problems
from this virus. Likewise, we strongly urge you to be sure that your
organization is up-to-date about this issue and that you take all possible
precautions to prevent any problems with your normal business functions.

Accordingly, we are providing three links to websites below that maintain
some of the most up-to-date and authoritative information we know of about
viruses such as these. If you have not already done so, we urge you to
visit one or more of these sites to familiarize yourself with the issue.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

NYISO Communications

"CAM Applications to Engines with Catalytic Converters","I am trying to compile a list of engines with catalytic converters that will be subject to Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) regulations.  All of the following four conditions must be met for CAM to apply:
1.  The emission unit must be located at a facility with a Title V permit.
2.  The emission unit must be subject to an emission limitation or standard, including a permit condition, for an applicable regulated air pollutant.
3.  The emission unit must use an add-on control device to achieve compliance with the emission limit or standard.  
4.  The emission unit must have ""potential pre-control device emissions"" equal to or greater than the amount required for a source to be classified as a major source under Title V (i.e. 100 tpy for criteria pollutants and 10/25 tpy for HAPs). 

If an emission unit is subject to CAM then a CAM Plan must be prepared and submitted with a Title V Permit application/renewal.  I will develop a standard plan for submission.

 A list of all the engines with catalytic converters is attached based on Power Services database.  Review the list for accuracy.  In addition, update the Title V status of each facility.  The last two columns (major for CO w/o controls and major for NOx  w/o controls) are based on AP-42 factors for rich-burn engines and a specific heat rate of 8500 Btu (LHV)/bhp-hr converted to 9350 Btu (HHV)/bhp-hr to determine whether a unit would be major for CO or NOx pre-control.  Review the permits for the units that would be major for NOx and/or CO to determine if an emission limitation or standard applies to the pollutant for which the unit would be major.  Let me know by January 15 which units you believe will require a CAM plan. 

Ruth

Folks,

Attached is an agenda for the ICAP deliverability conference call on Friday.
To facilitate discussion, I have put together a very rough draft that
identifies several of the major approaches and the concerns raised and
concerns addressed by each.  I would invite all folks participating to make
comments clarifying each alternative as well as raising additional concerns
or identifying other concerns that are addressed by each approach.  If you
have another approach, please submit it for the group's consideration.
Thanks

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel


RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

"results of football pool","Hello everyone, 

	More upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.

	 In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. 

	Through all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. 

	I came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. 

	This coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week and next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afternoon. Finally, here are the results of this past weekend's picks with the number missed by each person after their name.

			your email address.

Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

I am attaching our additions, in a redlined version, to the very good start
on this survey of the landscape of ICAP deliverability. I won't be available
for the phone call, but Frank Felder will try to catch a good part of the

Subject:        ICAP Deliverability Task Force Conference Call



Folks,

Attached is an agenda for the ICAP deliverability conference call on Friday.
To facilitate discussion, I have put together a very rough draft that
identifies several of the major approaches and the concerns raised and
concerns addressed by each.  I would invite all folks participating to make
comments clarifying each alternative as well as raising additional concerns
or identifying other concerns that are addressed by each approach.  If you
have another approach, please submit it for the group's consideration.
Thanks

"Real -  Time operations","
""Depillo, Raymond V."" <Raymond.Depillo@pseg.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

A quick question on operations.

First, thank you to the ISO for updating the HAM prices.

Second - I have a question regarding dispatch.  I notice now that HAM prices
in NY City are in excess of $1,000.  Which to me, given a bid cap, implies
that everything capable of running will be dispatched.  Yet, when I look at
the dispatcher notices, I see that both the Gowanus and Astoria CT blocks
are running out of merit for the ISO (note - not local security).  How can
this be - certainly the HAM prices indicate these units should be running
for economics and setting price.  I hope we are not going to see the cost of
these units in our uplift charges.  I look forward to a response from the
ISO

"Your Role in Computer Virus Protection","As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.

"Organizational Announcement","
From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties.

NUGGETS & NOTES

Congratulations to Ann and Rodney Malcolm, vice president in EIM.  They are the proud parents of an 8 lb. 4 oz. baby boy named Scott.  He was born on Saturday, August 11, 2001.

Congratulations! Bennett and Sarah Brown, Enron Wholesale Accounting Manager, became the proud parents of a baby boy on Sunday, August 12, 2001.  His name is Baker Bennett Brown and he weighed 8 lbs.12 oz.

EIM Trivia
Enron Industrial Markets currently owns two paper mills - Garden State Paper in Garfield, NJ and Papiers Stadacona in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.  The combined annual newsprint capacity is 620,000 tonnes, which roughly translates to 137 billion square feet.  If you assume that the average width of a newspaper page is 25 inches, then this translates into Enron producing enough newsprint in a year to get us to Jupiter and half-way back to Earth.  Papiers Stadacona also produces approximately 100,000 tonnes per year of directory paper.  This translates into roughly 50 million telephone and trade directory books.  That's a lot of phone numbers!

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

"EDI Conference","Attached is the final agenda and list of attendees for the September
20-21st EDI Conference which is being held by the NY PSC in Albany. I
have noted that many of the Marketers currently active in KeySpan's

not to late to register to attend. Once again I must stress the
importance of all of our Marketers being prepared for the transition to

"New Legal Team to Assist RAC","	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"results of the football pool","Hello everyone, 

	Not as many upsets this past weekend in the college and pro games. Among the games that were commonly missed were, in the college games, Auburn/Georgia and Iowa/Northwestern; in the pros, Green Bay/Chicago, Miami/Indianapolis, and Oakland/Seattle. 

	Going into tonight's game, we have 4 people still alive for the money. Larry Campbell, Dave Ryan, Kayne Coulter and Joe Quenet, all who missed 4 games.  Dave, Kayne and Joe picked Baltimore and Larry picked Tennessee. Therefore, if Tennessee wins, then Larry will win outright. If Baltimore wins tonight, then it will come down to total points scored. Dave picked 24 points, Kayne has 29 and Joe had 56. Dave will win with Baltimore and 26 or less points, Kayne will win with Baltimore and between 27 and 42 points, and Joe will win with Baltimore and 43 or more points. 

	We only had 22 entries this weekend, therefore the prize will be $66. This coming week's games will be handed out tomorrow and due Thursday afternoon, since I will be off this Friday. Here are the results from the games with the amount of games each person missed.

"NEW ENRONONLINE FUNCTIONALITY","The following additions and modifications to Stack Manager will be effective as of Saturday September 8, 2001.

Stack Manager Modifications

Inactivate All Stack - In addition to the individual Activate/Inactive Stack buttons, there is now an Inactivate All Stack button. Similar to the Suspend All button, this button will inactivate the trader's stack on all active products. Any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable. See screen shot below: Inactivate All Stack button on far right. 

	 

Please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in Stack Manager.

Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack. In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose ""Fill order"". The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader. In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack.

Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank. On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics. Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices.

No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager. If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose ""No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down"". 

Changes regarding Suspension of products

Stack Manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases:

?	Market Close - If a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending. In order to keep a product's stack active past the set trading hours, the trader should choose ""Keep Awake"" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page.
?	Auto Suspend now inactivates stack - On a product with the Auto Suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product, the product's stack will be inactivated if the Suspend at level is reached. This feature can be used by checking the Enable box on the product properties page under the Auto Suspend section. 
?	Logging Out of Stack Manager- When you log out of Stack Manager without inactivating or suspending your products, the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them.

"December 1999 2nd Settlement Adjustment Invoice Banking Instructions","The invoices for December 1999 settlement adjustments will be posted by
23:00 today, Friday, September 28, 2001.  The NYISO apologizes for any
inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices.

Transmission  Customers  will  observe adjustments to their settlements to:
(1)  recover  costs  related  to  adjustments  made  outside of the billing
process;  (2)  adjust regulation penalty charges to zero for suppliers; and
(3)  adjust  the  NYISO  clearing account balance to zero for December 1999
settlements.

With  regard  to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these
adjustments  could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant
data fix.  As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments
is   done  outside  of  the  billing  process.   The  total  adjustment  of
$581,563.37  was  allocated  across 13,147,961 MWh.  Customers may validate
their  respective  adjustments  by  computing  their  ratio  shares  of the
$581,563.37  using  5,059,790  MWh  as  the denominator in their respective
ratios of their December 1999 load.  Customers will observe a difference in
the  denominators  used  in  the  ratio share allocation of this adjustment
versus  adjustment  #3.   This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the costs for
adjustment  #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the
adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment.

Prior  to  October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the
revenue   received  from  Schedule  1  charges,  which  were  comprised  of
forecasted  uplift  & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred
by  adjusting  subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.  In October
2000,  the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions
that  allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In  order  to  allow  any  changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be
settled  through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in
October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.  This results in
an  over-collection  which  is  being  returned  to  Customers  through  an
adjustment  to  their  monthly  balances.   This  billing treatment for the
December  1999  settlement  adjustments  resulted  in credits to the market
totaling  $5,219,402.09  allocated  across 13,191,237 MWh.  Customers where
allocated their portion of adjustment #3 above, based upon their respective
ratio shares of the 13,191,237 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for
the month.

December  1999  settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to
address  the  delay  in  invoicing.  Payments due to the NYISO for December
1999  settlement  adjustments  are due to be received in the NYISO clearing
account  on  Monday, October 15, 2001.  Payments due to market participants
will  be  made on Friday, October 19, 2001.  Please refer to the attachment
below for banking instructions.

Regards,
Randy A. Bowers
Manager - Customer Settlements

This offer is non-transferable.       2 For a prospectus containing  further information, including charges and expenses, please go to www.mutualfunds.etrade.com . Read the prospectus carefully before you invest. The prospectus contains  important information about the goals, risks, expenses, and investment  strategies applicable to the fund.  3 E*TRADE  allows you to invest online in thousands of mutual funds. E*TRADE provides,  for informational purposes only, data about the various mutual funds published  by independent third parties, such as Morningstar, Inc. and New River.  E*TRADE does not guarantee the appropriateness, fitness, or suitability  of any mutual fund. While E*TRADE believes that the data provided by these  third parties is reliable, it has no independent basis to verify or contradict  the accuracy or completeness of the information provided. No recommendation  or endorsement by E*TRADE as to any investment may be inferred from the  data provided.   4 The Morningstar star rating  takes a broad-based approach to looking at funds. To determine a fund's  star rating for a given period (three, five, or ten years), the fund's  Morningstar Risk score is subtracted from its Morningstar Return score.  The resulting number is plotted along a bell curve to determine the fund's  rating for each time period: If the fund scores in the top 10% of its  broad investment class(domestic stock, international stock, taxable bond,  or municipal bond), it receives five stars (Highest); if it falls in the  next 22.5%, it receives four stars (Above Average); a place in the middle  35% earns it three stars (Average); those in the next 22.5% receive two  stars (Below Average); and the bottom 10% get one star (Lowest).      5 You can obtain the prospectus  online for mutual fund shares available for purchase through E*TRADE.  Read the prospectus carefully before you invest in any mutual fund. The  prospectus contains important information about the goals, risks, expenses,  and investment strategies applicable to the fund. E*TRADE does not guarantee  or verify the accuracy or completeness of any mutual fund's prospectus,  statement of additional information, report to shareholders, or proxy  solicitation materials.    6 Inclusion of a fund in the E*TRADE Mutual Fund ALL-STAR  List is based on historical performance and is not intended to be predictive  of future performance of the fund. Morningstar selects fund for inclusion  through independent analysis based on quantitative factors, such as total  return, risk, manager tenure, and expenses; as well as a qualitative analysis  performed by Morningstar analysts.

Dear HAJCC Members,
Tonight, we have moved our table to Auchan's Supermarket from 6:00-9:00pm
with a Fireman. We need more members to help out. If you can make it please
contact Sharon at 713-596-2823. Currently, we have raised over $2,000 in
just 3 days. Please help us reach our goal of $5,000.
We need volunteers for September 22, 2001 at 8:00am at the Chinese Culture
center parking lot (10303 West Office Dr 77042 Near Ranchester and Westpark
) We need people to help us set up the event. The dress attire for all HAJCC
members is HAJCC T-shirt and Pants or Shorts. If you do not have a T-shirt
yet, just show up and see Sharon and she will have some extra shirts.
The Chinese Organizations of Houston will be holding a memorial service will
be conducted at 9:00pm to pay tribute to the victims and the heroes. We have
agreed to unite our efforts and come as one to show our support rather than
doing individual functions. We will have services performed by several
religious groups, and finishing the event by contributing the results of our
fund-raising efforts to our forgotten local heores, the Fire-fighters Union
and the Police Union. Also a portion of the proceeds will go to Channel 39's
parent company, who
will match 50-cents-on-the-dollar of our donations to organizations of our
choice. We are expecting over 500 people to attend this event. We Need
Volunteers to help out at our HAJCC booth from 8:00am-11:00am. We need
members to step up and help on this important project. This schedule will
also be coordinated by Steve & Homer. Steve Yang [yang_steve@hotmail.com] or
homerh@flash.net For that event, I will the emcee for the event so Steve and
Homer has been very nice to take on this project.

September 24 Monday at 6:00 at the Wortham Theater,  We need volunteer for
the Mayor's Teacher Award project just to help with the teachers. Please
give me a call if you are open. (832) 236-5049

Subject:        ICAP Deliverability Task Force Conference Call

 << File: ICAPDeliverabilityAgenda090701.doc >> << File: Deliverability
Issue 0904.doc >>
Folks,

Attached is an agenda for the ICAP deliverability conference call on
Friday.  To facilitate discussion, I have put together a very rough draft
that identifies several of the major approaches and the concerns raised and
concerns addressed by each.  I would invite all folks participating to make
comments clarifying each alternative as well as raising additional concerns
or identifying other concerns that are addressed by each approach.  If you
have another approach, please submit it for the group's consideration.

Thanks

In this enlightening installment of our monthly photo tips series, photo expert Kim Brady of the Imaging Resource shares five ways to make the most of outdoor light .  [IMAGE]   Creative Clicks   [IMAGE]Bonnie LaDoe of Portland, Oregon told us how she used Ofoto to preserve and share priceless family history.  What a great idea!   ""Recently, my son found a treasure of old photos while cleaning out his grandparents' estate.  He discovered pictures that were up to 100 years old, including ones of his great-grandparents growing up in Poland and Germany.  I scanned these photos (over 60 of them) into my computer and uploaded them to Ofoto.  I will be making a heritage album for my son's birthday this fall - it's wonderful to have quality prints of such important keepsakes.  Thank you for helping me save this little piece of history!""   Submit your ideas to creativeclicks@ofoto.com .  If we use your suggestion in OfotoFocus, you'll receive 25 free prints.   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  5 x 7"" Prints:  Bigger is Better!    We've always felt that 5 x 7"" is just the right size for favorite photos ? big enough for display but small enough to fit almost anywhere.  5 x 7"" enlargements are great as gifts, refrigerator art or office decor.  At just $0.99 per print, the price isn't big but the results are. Order yours today!   [IMAGE]  Edit Your Way to Great Photos    We all have those photos that would be perfect if only a few things could be fixed ? a stray thumb here, a bit of red-eye there. Ofoto's easy online editing tools  let you adjust and improve your photos until they're exactly the way you want them.  Whether it's cropping, removing red-eye or adjusting the lighting, your pictures will never be the same.  Just click Edit & Borders when you're viewing your photo to get started.

"Response to TIE Question on EDRP Results","
BKranz@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Matthew,

Accurate data detailing the response to activation of the Emergency Demand
Response Program (EDRP) will not be available until we receive metered data
from the Curtailment Service Providers.  An updated EDRP program status
will be written and posted on the NYISO website when this information
becomes available in a few days.  In the mean time, the NYISO has issued a
press release that provides some preliminary information on the EDRP
activation.

The press release can be found on the NYISO website at:
http://www.nyiso.com/topics/articles/index.html.

Additional information on the NYISO's Demand Response Programs can be found
at:

Regards,

Bradley Kranz

"IMPORTANT!  Actions needed Tuesday.","In preparation for the upcoming move to Enron Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6:30PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6:30PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances and cannot be down, please speak to the tech when he comes to your desk.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the ""My Documents"" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the ""My Documents"" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems.

"Team Captains Needed","Heart disease is the number one killer, but great strides have been made in the last fifty years.  Dr. DeBakey designed the first revolutionary procedure on his wife's sewing machine, and today, right on CNN, we can see the first human walking around with a completely artificial heart.  Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology.  

On Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk.  The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods.  

We are looking for 50 team captains.  The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.  The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.  Additional incentives are currently being developed.

If you are willing to serve as a team captain or a walker, please email or call Sue Wadsworth (713-853-5105) or Melissa Becker (713-853-6641).  We look forward to seeing you November 3 and demonstrating Enron's commitment to fighting heart disease.

Filed at the request of the Commission, NEPOOL's amendment informs the Commission on the general impact of the ISO-NE ICAP Order on the NEPOOL Filing. Generally, NEPOOL informs the Commission that its recent ICAP Order has little impact on NEPOOL's request, and NEPOOL has sought a November 1, 2001 effective date for the ICAP recall Rules.

"NEW ENRONONLINE FUNCTIONALITY","In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" Allowed Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the ""Restricted Top of Stack"" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" All"" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the ""Today's Orders"" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the ""Set"" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the "" Limit Order "" section. In order to do so, right click in the ""Today's Orders "" section and select the float window option. In order to make the window "" Stay On Top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.

Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

"RE: just checking..first one never went out","
""Kirkpatrick, Joe"" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Pre-contingency voltage limits have to be respected in order to validate
any existing interface limits.

As far as I can remember (the memory is the second thing to go)
stability limits are calculated using offline studies. Minimum voltage
limits are part of the study parameters, any voltages experienced in the
R/T that are below the minimum voltage limits used in the offline study
invalidates the stability limits. In other words if you cannot respect
the minimum voltage limits the stability limits are rendered invalid,
system operators do not know if the system can withstand the worst
system contingency as there has been no study to validate the limits at
that new low system voltage.

If a system voltage limit measured at a bus is below the minimum voltage
limit you must increase the bus voltage to the minimum voltage limit,
this is beyond SCD, and I suspect BME and SCUC (to some degree).

If the software cannot resolve the problem then a manual request for
generation or OOM request must be made to resolve it.

That aside the OOM issue is one that needs to be resolved. Some
generation needs to be dispatched OOM to resolve for system problems
that SCD or BME cannot resolve (inherent software deficiencies and
modelling problems), the big question is how do you discern between
legitimate OOM generation requests and other requests that are highly
suspect.

Joe

Can anyone tell me the difference between solving for a line constraint

"NYISO - MIS Outage - October 17, 2001 - Reminder Notice","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants

On October 17, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible
as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.  Ultimately,
these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You

market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the public web server (www.nyiso.com), MIS and
SPIDER that will be implemented on August 28, 2001.

Generation Supplier Issues --

Additional deliverables will be completed with the following
functionality added to the NYISO markets. Please refer to the
appropriate Technical Bulletin posted on the NYISO web site for
a complete and full description.

     Payment rules for unit start-up will be modified to allow
     a unit to receive start-up payments for both the Day Ahead
     and the Real-time market provided the unit is economically
     qualified and is scheduled in both markets.  This change is
     pending approval by the Business Issues Committee at its
     August 23, 2001 meeting.

     Payment rules for unforced energy replacement will also be
     modified.  Suppliers scheduled to provide energy or ancillary
     services to the NYISO marketplace may be eligible to recover
     their Day Ahead margins if insufficient revenue is realized
     to cover such costs.

     Uninstructed Over-generation will be allowed such that
     off-dispatch generating units will be allowed to follow
     economic base points and be paid for such deviations above
     their base points provided those deviations are economically
     consistent.

Lost Opportunity Cost Payments --

     These payments will be applied for the period from May 30, 2000
     through November 8, 2000 as defined by FERC order issued
     April 2, 2001.

System Changes (as ordered by FERC to expand mitigation rules for New York
City generating units) --

     Payments resulting from the Security Constrained Unit Commitment
     (SCUC), including minimum generation, start-up and energy payments
     for all in-City generation may be mitigated.

     Payments resulting from Supplemental Resource Evaluation (SRE)
     commitment, including minimum generation, start-up and energy
     payments for all in-City generation may be mitigated.

     Mitigation measures may also be applied to energy, start-up and
     minimum generation payments made to units operated out-of-merit (OOM)
     in Real-Time for all in-City generation.

Additional Changes --

     Market Participants will be allowed to query the Customer Relations
     Help Desk system from the NYISO web site.  This will allow
participants
     to check on the status of their current questions and review their
     historical questions/issues with the NYISO.

     A new menu option will be available on the Bidding and Scheduling
     page.  The 'Daily Transaction Summary' report will show the status of
     all transactions for a user and their requested and scheduled MW's.

     A new Upload/Download template will be created that will give Market
     Participants access to specific billing data down to the 5-minute
level
     level of granularity.

     The migration of web postings from InfoReports to MrXML will continue.
     The structure of all migrated reports will be retained, therefore,
these
     changes will be transparent to the user.



If you notice any NYISO systems behave other than intended after
the scheduled implementation date, please let us know immediately.

It will be helpful if you refer to this notice if you communicate with us
about these changes.

Thank you,
Customer Relations

"Re: A response on today's horrid event from a Canadian","nothing to do, no friends, ran out of porno tapes, just wondering
aloud...

     to my true-blue, dye-in-the-wool, RED, WHITE & BLUE friends,

   Opening my e-mails and watching the news coverage on the
Clintonlover News Network this past week, i happily realized that
i live in a nation of heroes and patriots.
   Those firemen, police officers and volunteers in NYC who are
working around the clock to try to rescue people richly deserve to
be called heroes, for indeed they are TRUE HEROES  (how many of my
friends, how many of YOU, would be there, among the ruins, if some
assholes had, say, hit the Transco Tower ? would i ? i know a
certain OD who might have, but how many more ? just wondering...)
They ARE heroes.
   Now about the patriots, all 280,000,000 of them.
   An ""unusually high number"" of people run to their local Wal-
Mart to buy a flag, and CNN calls America a nation of patriots.
It is ONE thing to tie a bloody ribbon to your Lexus or pick-up
truck (never understood the public display, shouldn't we mourn in
our hearts ? no problem with it, whatever floats your boat, just
find the PUBLIC part strange), it is altogether ANOTHER thing to
pick up a weapon and go fight the fukkin' Mujahedins in the
fukkin' Afghan mountains (there are no Starbucks in Kabul, just
ask the Soviets...)  REAL war, no smart-bombs-live-on-CNN-safe-on-
your-couch-Mickey-Mouse war;  REAL war, maybe for the first time
in history, on American soil.  We know the fukkers will be
committed, will our side be ?  Strange thing, commitment.  When
the Bolsheviks fought the White Russians, Feliks Dzherhinsky
compared it to bacon and eggs;  he said that the pig is COMMITTED,
the chicken is only INVOLVED.  He knew what he was talking about:
he was a pig (literally, bastard founded the KGB), and he won.
   So, let us all take a deep breath (if anything, just to mourn
the innocent victims in NYC and DC), and call things fo what they
are, a duck a duck and a poodle a poodle (sic!)  Those people in
NYC are heroes, we'll find out about the patriots.

PS

  Notice how when the camelbastards wanted to hit at the SYMBOL of
America, they hit the World Trade Center.  Ummm, isn't there
something called the Statue of Liberty, not a mile away?
  ""Give us your poor, give us your weak, give us your down-trodden""
  ""America, the craddle of democracy, the moral compass of a
misguided world""  ???
  People will die for their beliefs, and those things are worth
dying for.
  America's greatest virtue is its wealth, not its moral
superiority, the evil bastards hit at the true heart of America:
      They hit Corporate U$A
  America won't go to war, 280,000,000 people don't believe in
Coca-Cola all that much.

"Enron Update","Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

    They're known for taking their time between albums, but since the release  of Return to Saturn just last year, No Doubt has been working furiously to bring you Rock Steady--their best album yet!  In making the album, the band worked with Prince, William Orbit and Nellee Hooper and had to travel from Los Angeles  to Jamaica to London and back.   The upbeat sound on Rock Steady was influenced by after-show parties and Jamacian dance-hall CDs. And old fans of No Doubt will ""no doubt"" recognize traces of the band's original  ska sound--""Rocksteady"" is the term used for the classic 1960s ska  music which preceded reggae.     	     No Doubt's first video, ""Hey Baby,"" off their new album!  [IMAGE]   Exclusive No Doubt Interview!  [IMAGE]   Rock Steady hits stores on December 11th! Check out these great prices offered on Yahoo!

NEPOOL explained that the proposed differences in percentages applicable to the Energy Block Price were appropriate since they apply to different base values depending on whether the resource is regularly or seldom run in economic merit order.  The price percentages applicable to Startup and No-Load bids are the same for both resources as both resources use the same base value.  

	If you need further information, please let me know.

$22,000 for O&M??

I am not sure how in the world this can be considered a typical example.
Where are the taxes?
Where are the interest payments?
Return on Investment?

If the objective is to grossly misrepresent the cost of a GT then this
is a typical example.

Attached is a revised presentation from Norman Mah for the Sept. 24 ICAP
Working Group meeting. The presentation is three pages long. The change
made
in this version is on page 2: the ""O&M"" number has been lowered to
$22,000
from the previous version, in response to comments received by Mr. Mah.
Otherwise, the presentation mirrors the one previously circulated.

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

Subject: NMED Compliance Order



** Proprietary **

Lou,

I attach a draft of a chronology of events concerning the P-1 compressor station matter.

I have tried to keep the chronology as short as possible.  I have not included in this draft the dates that Transwestern applied for and received two modifications to the permit for the P-1. Transwestern applied for the first modification on July 26, 1996 to convert the P-1 from a regenerative cycle to a simple cycle and to include a 126 HP stand by generator.  That permit modification was issued on February 21, 1997.  Transwestern applied for the second modification on January 6, 1997.  That application sought an increase in the horsepower of the facility from 2500 to approximately 3700 horsepower.  NMED issued that amendment on September 8, 1997. 

On the one hand , the fact that NMED issued the modifications is good for us because it shows that Transwestern properly and timely applied for modifications when it understood such action to be required and because it arguably shows that NMED did not see the May 1996 issue as being significant enough to prevent their issuing modifications to that permit.  Including all of that material in the chronology, however, may 'muddy the waters"" and may make the chronology less powerful.  Let me know if you think we should include those events.

I look forward to your comments on this.

"August 25, 2001 residuals","
RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Upon review of August 25, 2001 advisory billing statements you will observe
significant balances for Transmission Customer Ancillary Services: Residual
Adjustments.  This is due to the NYISO not receiving a file from ConEd that
contains their sub-zonal load data.  When this file is not received for use
in the billing process, the billing system sees the ConEd subzones with NO
load in real time.  This causes all DAM LSE purchases and scheduled
transaction energy with ConEd points of withdrawal to be sold back to the
market in real time.  The deficiency in revenue is shared by all through
the residual adjustment.  We have received the missing file and intend to
rerun August 25th this evening.  The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience
caused by this problem.

with the suggested dates.

"ICAP Supplier UCAP and LSE UCAP Requirements","
JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Attachment A of the Stage 2 ICAP Manual, as posted, states that on
September 28, 2001 the NYISO will inform ICAP Suppliers of the amount of
Unforced Capacity they are qualified to offer in the 2001-2002 Winter
Capability Period. It also states that LSEs will be notified of the final
Unforced Capacity requirements (""UCR"") for the upcoming Obligation
Procurement Period.  Neither statement is correct and a revised Timeline is
available for comment. It will be discussed and finalized at the next ICAP
Working Group Meeting on October 5.  After that October 5 meeting, the
updated and corrected Timeline will be posted for approval at the October
25 BIC Meeting.

Providing firm final ICAP Supplier UCAP values or LSE UCRs was never
feasible in this timeframe.  Preliminary LSE UCRs for November were
provided to all LSEs on September 21.  Final LSE UCRs will be provided on
October 9.

ICAP Suppliers can estimate their UCAP value based information already
supplied. All ICAP Suppliers will have a firm UCAP value for November prior
to October 9, if there are no problems with the data submitted and in time
to participate in the Monthly Auction to be conducted on October 11. In the
meantime, Suppliers can offer as much or as little UCAP for the Winter
Capability Period strip auction as they expect to have available,
recognizing that their EFORd values will be updated monthly during the
Capability Period.  Recognize also that there will continue to be Monthly
and Deficiency auctions conducted each month during the Capability Period,
allowing any Supplier or LSE to clear any long or short postions.

Here are some morning funnies =)

********************************************



The Rules of Being A Guy.....

1. Any Man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally killed and
eaten by his fellow partygoers.

2. Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.

3. It is ok for a man to cry under the following circumstances:
   a. When a heroic dog dies to save its master
   b. The moment Angelina Jolie starts unbuttoning her blouse
   c. After wrecking your boss' Ferrari
   d. One hour, 12 minutes, 37 seconds into The Crying Game
   e. When your Date is using her teeth

4. Unless he murdered someone in your family, you must bail a friend out of
jail within 12 hours.

5. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend move
   a. Your legs have been severed in a freak threshing accident

6. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend of a friend move:
   a. You'd rather stay home and watch speed buggy reruns

7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off limits
forever, unless you actually marry her.

8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy who's running late
is 5 minutes.  Maximum waiting time: 6 minutes.  For a girl, you have to
wait
10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale.

9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's fridge is forbidden.
Gripe at will if the temperature is unsuitable.

10. No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for another man.
(In fact, even remembering your buddy's birthday is strictly optional.)

11. On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops, not the
weakest.

12. While your girlfriend must bond with your buddies' girlfriends within 30
minutes of meeting them, you are not required to make nice with her gal
pals'
significant dick-heads--- low level sports bonding is all the law requires
(sorry ladies, it's called a double standard because it's twice as true).

13. Unless you have signed a lucrative endorsement contract, do not appear
in
public wearing more than one swoosh.

14. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you may always
ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing.

15. You may flatulate in front of a woman only after you have brought her to
climax. If you trap her head under the covers for the purpose of flatulent
entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend.

16. It is permissible to quaff a fruity chick drink only when you're sunning
on a tropical beach....and it's delivered by a topless supermodel...and it's
free.

17. Only in situations of Moral and/or Ass peril are you allowed to kick
another guy in the nuts.

18. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.

19. Friends don't let friends wear Speedos. Ever. Issue closed.

20. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem---you didn't see nothin'.

21. Women who claim they ""love to watch sports"" must be treated as spies
until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to pick a
buffalo wing clean.

22. You must offer heartfelt and public condolences over the death of a
girlfriend's cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire and threw
it
into a ceiling fan.

23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must remain
sober enough to fight.

24. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza,
but
not both.
  That's just plain mean.

25. If you complement a guy on his six-pack, you'd better be talking about
his choice of beer.

26. Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a buddy of yours, except
if
she's withholding sex pending your response.

27. Phrases that may not be uttered to another man while lifting weights:
   a. Yeah, Baby, Push it!
   b. C'mon, give me one more! Harder!
   c. Another set and we can hit the showers!
   d. Nice Ass, Are you a Sagittarius?

28. Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal footing: both
urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other situations, an almost
imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need.

29. Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than you are
able
to have sex with her.  Keep a stopwatch by the phone; Hang up if necessary.

30. When a buddy is trying to hook up, you may sabotage him only in a manner
that gives you no chance of getting laid either.

31. You cannot rat out a coworker who shows up at work with a massive
hangover. You may however, hide the aspirin, smear his chair with limburger
cheese, turn the brightness dial all the way down so he thinks his monitor
is
broken, and have him paged over the loudspeaker every seven minutes.

32. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly ""just a friend"" have
carnal drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling weird and guilty is
no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a big
mistake it was.

33. Always split aces and eights.  No arguments.

NERC ANNOUNCEMENT

We are pleased to PRE-announce significant enhancements to the NERC CRC

Internet site.

CRC provides information to the Electricity Industry:

1.  NERC Eastern Interconnection Transmission Loading Relief events.

2.  NERC Energy Emergency Alerts.

3.  Data on key flowgates.

4.  The Transaction Distribution Factor viewer.

5.  The Generator Shift Factor viewer.

6.  Links to factor and document files.

The existing site:

< <http://crc.nerc.com>>

will remain active as the official updated functional site until the

cutover, which is tentatively planned for the evening of Tuesday 07

August 2001; during the cutover there will be a planned outage of the

CRC site for a short time, expected to be no longer than one hour.

The new site will have the same URL.

The beta site is available for your inspection until the cutover:

< <http://crc2.nerc.com>>

You are encouraged to check this out and to review the changes in

format. There will likely be some continuing work and the exact

appearance may be altered somewhat prior to the cutover. Please note

that download files are available under the new heading ""Downloads"".

Thank you, and questions can be directed to NERC at:

609-452-8060

I have used various company databases and industry contacts to classify all engines as rich-burn or lean-burn.  Please review this information and let me know if you agree/disagree with the classifications or if engines are missing.  Please share this information with others on your teams.  Call (402-398-7716) or email me with ANY comments.  I'd like to have an accurate understanding of all the pipeline systems when the regulations are proposed.

"ENA Gas Structuring","
In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

"NYISO - Generation in Response to Price Signals","
FCiani@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

One of the Generation Issues objectives deployed in September was to allow
off-dispatch units to move in response to price signals.  A settlement
feature of this change was that off-dispatch units would not receive bid
production cost guarantees for incremental energy.  These units would only
be guaranteed cost recovery for minimum generation and start-up costs.

The function to limit this cost recovery was incorrectly designed, with the
result that the cost recovery was not limited to the bid minimum generation
cost.  The cost recovery was incorrectly calculated as the bid minimum
generation MW  times the bid minimum generation cost.

This error has been corrected and will be reflected in the next execution
of the September settlement statements, which will correct the values
before the September invoicing period.

If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

"Enron and United Way's Continued Partnership","
Last month all of your donations helped Enron raise a grand total of $6 million for the United Way, including our corporate match.  Once again Enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in Houston. Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign.  Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity!

This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo.

The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.  This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community.

The millions of fans who attend Astros games each season will see the sign.  Be sure to look for this history-making sign hanging high above the outfield.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"Moving forward after this week's tragedy","Dear Larry Campbell:
All of us at Datek share with the country the sense of extreme loss 
and shock created by the terrorist events that happened earlier this 
week. It was a defining moment in U.S. history. As the time of healing 
begins, Datek joins all Americans in extending our sympathies to the 
victims and their families, and in supporting all efforts to make this 
country whole again. 
Rest assured that your Datek account and the capital market system is 
secure, and that the assets you have invested with us remain fully 
protected. Datek stands ready to serve your needs when the U.S. equity 
markets reopen in the next few days. 
On Tuesday, we shut down our call center shortly after the New York 
attacks. The location of our Jersey City headquarters--directly across 
the Hudson River from the World Financial Center--quickly made us a 
staging area for the area's massive rescue and re-supply efforts. Our 
call center was converted into a location where the rescued or injured 
were able to contact family and loved ones, and we transformed our 
building into a safe haven for victims of the disaster, as well as a 
command center for hundreds of brave rescue workers. 
Countless Datek employees volunteered to pitch in whenever, 
wherever and however they could. Like so many other good Americans, 
they demonstrated their solidarity with the victims and their 
families by supporting the live-saving and life-affirming efforts 
of local authorities. 
There are a few things that you should be aware of related to your 
online account with Datek and equities trading in general: 
?  The U.S. equity markets will reopen on Monday, September 17. 
?  The ability to place orders in your account will be available well 
   in advance of the market opening. 
?  All pre-market executed orders on September 11 will stand and be 
   cleared. 
?  All unexecuted day orders placed on September 11 will be canceled. 
?  All GTC orders will remain good orders until you cancel them. 
?  Any orders that you cancelled over the phone on September 12 and 
   September 13 may still appear in your account as open orders. 
   However, Datek will cancel these orders before the market 
   re-opens. 
?  All margin calls due on September 10 will be due when the market 
   re-opens. 
?  Any checks written against Datek accounts will be honored. 
?  All valid check, wire or Funds Now requests made after 2:00 PM EST 
   September 10 will be paid. 
As always, Datek Customer Service representatives are ready to assist 
you. If you have any questions about your account or Datek's 
capabilities, please call us at 1-800-U2-Datek (1-800-823-2835) or 
e-mail us at support@datek.com . 
Our leaders have told us that the best way to beat back terrorism is 
by maintaining our composure and way of life in the face of barbarism. 
We were privileged to be able to play a role as the nation responded 
to this cowardly attack. Datek and our colleagues in the securities 
industry stand ready to continue to provide for the most respected and 
stable financial markets in the world. We appreciate your patience as 
Datek, the industry, and the nation return to normalcy. Our thoughts 
and prayers are with all those affected by these tragic events. 
Sincerely, 
Ed Nicoll

"Important Service Notice Regarding Your Margin Account","Dear Larry Campbell:
On September 28, 2001, new NASD/NYSE day trading margin requirements 
will go into effect for all brokers. The new industry-wide day trading 
rules outline specific requirements that all accounts that frequently 
day trade must comply with. 
While the new day trading rules offer increased leverage, they also 
present the opportunity for greater losses. We ask that you take 
the time to understand how the new day trading rules will affect 
your account. 
My account hasn't been tagged as a pattern day trader account. What 
does this have to do with me?
Datek is giving all margin accounts access to the additional day 
trading buying power as permitted by the new rule. Unless your 
account's trading pattern matches that of the NASD/NYSE day trading 
margin rule, you will not be required to meet day trading margin 
restrictions. However, we still ask that all margin account holders be 
educated on the new rules as they may affect your account. Should your 
account be tagged as a pattern day trading account in the future, 
Datek will notify you of the designation. 
What are the new day trading margin requirements for pattern 
day traders?
A ""pattern day trader"" is defined as an account that makes 4 
round-trip day trades (buying and selling the same security in one 
day) in any rolling 5 business day period. Pattern day traders will be 
subject to a new set of day trading rules and requirements. Here's 
what you need to know: 
? Under the new rules, customers that have been identified as 
   pattern day traders must maintain $25,000 in marginable equity at 
   all times. Pattern day trader accounts that fall below the $25,000 
   NASD/NYSE minimum will be restricted to cash transactions only, 
   until the minimum equity amount is reached. Go to 
   http://www.datek.com/helpdesk/transfers.html  to find out how to 
   transfer equity or http://www.datek.com/helpdesk/deposits.html 
   for information on depositing cash and securities to meet the new 
   $25,000 minimum. 
? A day trading margin call will be generated as soon as an executed 
   day trade in a pattern day trader account exceeds the day trading 
   buying power. Customers will have 5 business days to fulfill a day 
   trading margin call. Only a deposit of cash or fully paid securities 
   can satisfy a day trading margin call. 
? A day trading call must be met in 5 business days. If the day 
   trade margin call is not satisfied by the fifth business day, the new 
   NASD/NYSE rules require that the account be restricted to trading on a 
   cash available basis for 90 days or until the day trade call is met. 
How am I given increased leverage under the new rules?
The new rules modify the day trading buying power calculations, 
giving you access to 4 times the margin maintenance excess. This 
is a two-fold increase in the possible leverage available under 
current rules. 
Example: A pattern day trader with a cash balance of $30,000 and no 
positions in their account would have access to $120,000 day trading 
buying power ($120,000 = (4*30,000)). 
Day trading buying power is calculated based on the positions and cash 
in an account at the end of the trading day. Generally, you can 
calculate your day trading buying power using the following formula: 
[75% of the Long Stock Value (LSV) - 130% of any Short Stock Value 
(SSV) + Cash]*41
As an added benefit, we will display your day trading buying power in 
real-time on your portfolio and trading pages as soon as the new rules 
go into effect. This buying power figure is the amount available for 
day trading. Day trading buying power does not change based on gains 
and losses in your account that occur intra-day. 
Be aware that all margin accounts will have access to the greater of 
either their stock buying power or their day trading buying power. Our 
systems will always allow an order to go through based on the higher 
buying power amount. Since our systems have no way of determining 
whether you will hold the position overnight or just for the day, it's 
your responsibility to enter trades that remain within the buying 
power for the type of trade you're making. 
What can I do to meet a day trading margin call?
Should you need to meet a day trading margin call, the fastest way is 
by wiring funds to your account or sending an overnight check. For 
help with mailing addresses and wire instructions, go to http://www.datek.com/helpdesk/deposits.html . Remember, day trading 
calls can only be met by depositing cash or non-margined securities. 
Is this industry-wide? Will all brokers have to comply with 
these rules?
The new day trading rules are NASD/NYSE requirements that will have to 
be followed by all brokers. We are ready for these changes and are 
taking all the right steps to make sure you are ready as well. If your 
account is tagged as a pattern day trading account according to the 
new NASD/NYSE definition, you will receive notification from Datek. If 
your account has already been tagged as a pattern day trader under the 
current rule, the tag will remain in place for 90-days after your last 
day-trade and you will be required to be in compliance with the new 
rule as of September 28, 2001. 
Fully understanding your risk tolerance and the new NASD/NYSE margin 
requirements allows you to better manage your margin account. Please 
review our Helpdesk at http://www.datek.com/helpdesk/margin.html#daytrading  for more 
information on the new day trading rules. If you have questions about 
the NASD's new margin requirement or need assistance with your 
account, please email our customer support staff 24 hours a day, 7 
days a week at support@datek.com, or call 1-877-94-DATEK 
(1-877-943-2835) from 8 AM to midnight ET on weekdays, and from 9 AM 
to 7 PM ET on weekends. 
Sincerely, 
Datek Online Financial Services LLC 
Above examples are for illustrative purposes only. 
1 Portfolios with low priced short positions are calculated 
slightly different. Please consult our Help Desk for more information 
on calculating D.T. Buying Power with short positions. 
System response and access times may vary due to market conditions, 
system performance and other factors.

"Enron Principal Investments - Organizational Memo","
Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

     290 Washington Avenue Extension
     Albany, NY 12203

There will be lunch at NOON. The meeting starts at
12.45 to 4.30 PM.

Dr. Celia Chen and Dr. Steve Cochran from Economy.com
will present the outlook for New York, Northeast and U.S.
economies. The meeting is open to any market participant
interested in attending.

I encourage market participants to attend this meeting
particularly given the current 'uncertainty' on where the
economy is heading. The presentations will cover a
broad range of issues, including:

?    will the interest rate cuts help?
?    was the tax cut sufficient, or 'timely?'
?    how are the New York metro economies doing?
?    the impact of the stock market on New York, and
?    what are the implications of the global economic
     slowdown to the U.S. economy?

The last meeting in March was vibrant and insightful.
I anticipate the same for the next one, so mark your
calendars. Also, send me any questions that you
would like to see addressed by Economy.com.
Preferably by September 28.

Please call me or send email to confirm your attendance.

Regards,

Will.

"INFO ALERT: MERH","
   NEW CORPORATE PLAYER IN THE INDUSTRY AGAINST CYBER-TERRORISM   [IMAGE]  IMMEDIATE BUY RECOMMENDATION Initiating Research Coverage   Merilus Inc.    Symbol: MERH Shares Outstanding: 13.2 million Share Price: $1.90 Market Capitalization: $25 million 52 Week Hi/Low: $8.50/$0.45 Estimated Public Float: 2 million shares  Developed over the last four years, Merilus has recently started marketing the latest and most advanced computer security products targeted for small to medium businesses.   This market has been, and is projected to be, one of the fastest sectors in technology, largely unaffected by the current weakness in the market.      THE PROBLEM AND OPPORTUNITY A Computer Security Institute and FBI survey showed 90% of large organizations detected breaches into their computing systems.  74% of these organizations acknowledged financial losses.  Price Waterhouse estimated this loss to be about $40 billion last year.  The estimated number of computer attacks doubled last year according to the Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University.  International Data Corp. (IDC) predicts the compounded annual growth rates of digital security revenues will continue at over 88% per year over the next 5 years.    Merilus' products target small to medium businesses, a particularly fast growing segment of the overall security market, which has been underserved by the major security manufacturers.  IDC estimates the small to medium business percentage of the total internet security software market will increase from the current 43% to about 70% by 2004. In terms of dollars, this means companies with fewer than 1000 employees could spend about $7.4 billion on security in 2004.  We strongly feel Merilus is focusing on the right market, at the right time.   MERILUS SOLUTIONS Merilus' computer software and hardware products represent major innovations, which protect against computer information theft from hackers and others both outside and within the business.  Their recently introduced FireCards are the world's first network security system and firewall (controlling who can access what type of data) that easily inserts into the standard PCI slot inside the computer. It is a computer within the computer allowing for remote updating of new innovations and security measures to ensure sensitive data is protected as well as transmitted in a secure manner.   Industry reviews have given the new products high ratings.  Secure Computing Magazine gave the FireCard a five out of five star rating and The Tech Zone awarded a 9.5 out of 10 score.  NASA and Lockheed Martin are just a couple of the sophisticated organizations that have started using Merilus products.  Even though Merilus and its products are relatively new to the market place we feel they will also have good acceptance because they are extremely price competitive.  Management will strive to maintain its current 2:1 cost/feature ratio, where products are either half the price of competitors for the same functionality or twice the functionality for the same price.  Manufacturing of the products is contracted out to keep capital and inventory costs down and flexibility up.   THE ROLLOUT Over the summer, after rigorous testing in Compaq's labs, Merilus has become a member of the Compaq Solutions Alliance, allowing installation of products into Compaq computers. Merilus recently announced they have partnered with the three largest distributors in North America: Ingram Micro, Tech Data and EMJ.  Last week Merilus announced its Reseller Program, which provides marketing and technical support as well as substantial rebates to vendors selling Merilus' suite of computer security products.   MANAGEMENT Dana Epp, President of Merilus started writing commercial security monitoring software at the age of 14 and authored the book Computer Security Concepts, Managing Business Threats in a Wired World.  Merilus has attracted a number of credible and notable Board members such as John Connally, son of the former US Treasury Secretary, John Paul DeJoria, Chairman of John Paul Mitchell Systems.   FINANCIALS and PROJECTIONS Two companies established in this industry are SonicWall (SNWL) and Watchguard Technologies (WGRD).  Over the last couple of years these two companies have enjoyed approximately 100% annualized revenue growth.  Analyst's consensus (Thompson Financial) is that they will have sales growth next year of about 50% and 40%, respectively. Merilus is in the process of raising $3 million in a Private Placement to power its marketing initiatives, increase inventory and to strengthen its balance sheet.  Management and its financiers expect to close this needed funding before year-end. Currently the Company has minimal, but rapidly increasing revenues.    Management is estimating revenues of $8 million next year increasing to $34 million in 2003.  In 2003 they estimate achieving net income of roughly $4 million.  By 2003, we estimate the shares outstanding could increase to about 18 million.  If these numbers were met and a price to earnings ratio of 30 was applied, it could suggest a possible $6 share price.  Management's latest estimates are for revenues increasing to $93 million in 2004.  Merilus is little known in investment circles however an Investor Awareness Program is expected to start next week.

"results of football pool","Hello Everyone, 

	This weekend saw more tough games to pick, both in college and the pros. Among the games missed by many people were, in college games, Michigan/Michigan St.; Stanford/Washington; UCLA/Washington St.; Illinois/Purdue; and Texas A&M/TexasTech. 
In the pros, Baltimore/Pittsburgh was not a good game for most people, Seattle/Washington was a bad one and NY/Jets/New Orleans was missed by most people, while Kansas City/San Diego was not correctly picked by anyone. 

	We had 31 entries this week, making the pot $93. Currently in the lead is Robert Vargas, with only 6 games missed. No one else had 6 wrong, while Carter Ellis was the only one with 7 wrong. Robert picked Denver tonight, while Carter picked Oakland. Therefore, if Denver wins, Robert will win outright; if Oakland wins, then it will come down to the total points scored. Robert chose 49, while Carter choose 30. Therefore, if Oakland wins and there is 40 or more points, then Robert will win, 39 or less with Oakland, then Carter will win. Here are the number of games each person missed this week.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
In early July, the EIM Fundamentals Siebel Team launched Siebel Episode II: Siebel Express Enhancements.  Siebel Episode II added a number of new fields and views to the Siebel database, which is currently available to each of the over 150 traders, originators and senior management at EIM. Siebel provides these users with the ability to store all of their accounts, contacts, potential deals and activities in a common, shared repository.  In early August, Enron Freight Markets will follow EIM's lead and launch Siebel Episode II to their front-office personnel.  

Enron Global Strategic Sourcing, in collaboration with Enron Net Works, recently executed a two-year agreement with SkyTel Communications, Inc. to provide users with one- and two-way local and nationwide numeric/alphanumeric pagers, advanced messaging service devices, and encrypted remote e-mail services via Blackberry? enabled devices.

Under this agreement, Enron will also receive special discount incentives including, 50% discount on Blackberry?-enabled hardware purchases through year-end 2001, trade-in allowances on select Research in Motion (RIM) units through year-end 2001, upload and download of contact lists from select pc-compatible hardware to new RIM devices, customized training for hardware and services featured quarterly, and monthly service costs that will be billed at 50% of normal rates for a limited time.

Personal toll free numbers, personal voice mail, operator dispatched text messages, pin-to-pin messaging and text-to-voice and text-to-fax service options will be available on select devices, including Motorola T900 and P935.

EA-Office of the Chairman
The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described here.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.


IN THE NEWS

NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp., EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks told Reuters on Tuesday.

The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursing mergers or acquisition for now, according to Greg Piper.


UNITED WAY 2001

Showers:  Enron's Body Shop has provided showers for all Day of Caring volunteers.  Waivers will be available on the bus ride to the Enron Building.  Wear your shirt and sign in at the registration desk at The Body Shop.

United Way Challenge:  To compete against the other business units, EWS must create a team of 7-10 people to build a model of Enron's attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  You will be provided with the building materials and you will have a total of 45 minutes to work along with your teammates to get your model completed.  The primary building material will be Legos.  After the competition, the Legos will be donated to local non-profit childcare centers.
On Friday, August 10 at 11:00 am, the teams will meet to begin construction and they have 45 minutes to complete their model of Enron's attributes.  At 12:00 pm, Ken Lay will host the judging competition with the winner decided using ""The Applause Meter.""
Each team must consist of 7 to 10 members from their business unit and must have at least 3 executives (i.e., Directors or above).  The model must be freestanding.  And, although Legos will be provided as the primary building tool, other materials may be used, so use your imagination.
Please call or e-mail Julie Clyatt if you are interested in participating.  She can be reached at ext. 3-3256.

"United Way 2001- Days Of Caring","Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign officially kicks off on Monday, August 6.  The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from you, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison.  You have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers.  

In response, each Enron business unit has dedicated one Day of Caring to assist their adopted United Way agency.  Your challenge is to support your business unit by volunteering for various service projects. As an added incentive, a little friendly competition between business units has been incorporated into the campaign.  Strive to be the business unit with the highest percentage of volunteers and you'll be recognized at the Appreciation Lunch on August 10th in Antioch Park.

Be on the lookout for more information about this campaign.  Your business unit Day of Caring representative will provide details about each project and coordinate team assignments.  



Date	Company	Adopted Agency	Business Unit Representative	
August 7, 2001	EES	YMCA of Greater Houston	Amy Buehler x37635	
August 8, 2001	Corp	Jewish Community Center	Rebecca Phillips x39591	
August 9, 2001	ETS	Neighborhood Centers	Kimberly Nelson x33580	
August 10, 2001	EWS	Center for the Retarded	Julie Clyatt x33256	


Enron is committed to Houston, a world-class city.  Your generosity sets the standard for all of our employees and shows that we are indeed committed to Building Houston's Future.  Join us for the Days of Caring and make a positive difference in the lives of one out of every two Houstonians!

"Management Changes","I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business.

In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron.

I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan.

Please join me in supporting Stan in his expanded role and in wishing Ken and Kevin the very best of success in their new endeavors.

"NEW ENRONONLINE FUNCTIONALITY","Several changes have been made to Stack Manager and the website. These changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of Monday September 3, 2001.


Stack Manager Changes

Activate/Inactivate Stack - This functionality allows the trader to pull a product's prices from the website without suspending the product. If the Top of Stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product; therefore, if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website. 

If a product's stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager. If the stack is active it will appear in black font.

To use this feature, select the product, right click and choose ""Inactivate Stack"". When you are ready to reactivate your prices, select the same product, right click again and choose ""Activate Stack"". There are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will Activate/Inactivate the stack of the highlighted product. See screen shot below for the icons.

					 

Changes to Product Properties - Currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen, the product will be suspended and pulled from the website. Now instead of being suspended, the product's stack will become inactive. Once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the Activate Stack icon as discussed above.


Website Change

Restrictions on Top of Stack orders - If Top of Stack limit orders are allowed on a product, but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer, limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product.


If you have any questions please call me at 31787. Thanks.

"United Way 2001 -  Building Houston's Future","Building Houston's Future, Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign, officially kicks off today and runs through August 17.  Last year your support helped Enron raise $2.8 million, which was 21 percent more than our original goal.

This year, we hope to reach our employee goal of $2.9 million.  Enron will match every employee's contribution dollar-for-dollar.  We ask that employees who gave last year consider increasing their pledge this year, and that those who did not give, consider making a modest donation.

The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers.  We will also be focusing on our United Way Scholars program, an innovative program created this year by Enron and the United Way.  The Scholars program builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs.

ON-LINE PLEDGING
We will once again utilize an on-line pledging system to streamline the pledge process that will require your HRGIS ID (shown below). Click on <https://hrglobal.enron.com> or go to <http://home.enron.com> to make your contribution and learn more about this year's campaign. Please make your electronic pledge no later than Friday, August 17.

DAYS OF CARING
We are focusing on flood relief, and on our business units, by replacing the traditional large-scale kick-off event with Days of Caring, which will take place Tuesday through Friday of this week. We invite you to join your business unit for a Day of Caring at your 2001 Adopted Agency. This year's adopted agencies were selected in part due to the amount of flood damage suffered by the agency or its clients. To sign up for Day of Caring, log on to <http://cr.enron.com/cr-cgi-bin/view_volops.pl>.

APPRECIATION LUNCH
Rounding out the Days of Caring is an Appreciation Event on Friday, August 10 in Antioch Park from 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.  Come celebrate the success of Days of Caring, enjoy a free Chic-Fil-A lunch and watch a team of your coworkers compete against the other business units by creating building block structures that exemplify Enron attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  Jackie Martin, President of the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, will join us in judging the structures. If you bring down the building blocks that were on your chair this morning and donate them to our 2001 Adopted Agencies, you will be entered in a drawing for two free round-trip airline tickets anywhere in the U.S.

Thank you for your generosity. We look forward to your participation and seeing you throughout the week at Days of Caring and at the Appreciation Event on Friday!

If you have any questions regarding the online application, please call the HRGIM help desk at ext. 3-5666.

"A Way to Give from sportsbook.com","Dear friends, all of us have been horribly saddened by the events in New York and Washington, DC this past Tuesday. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have suffered.  For those receiving this note, we hope you are well and safely with your loved ones.
One way to help the victims of this tragedy is to go to: http://www.sportsbook.com/redcross.shtml 
Please enter an amount you wish to donate to the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund from your account.
Sportsbook.com will match your donation dollar per dollar.
Sportsbook.com will not realize any profits from money donated to the red cross fund 
Though we have all been shocked by this tragedy, we urge you and your friends and family to remain calm.  Atrocities of this magnitude are committed by truly sick individuals, not normal human beings.  As people's shock turns to anger, we have seen some incidents of violence.  Lashing out at visible minorities only serves to further the cause of those who have committed these foul acts.  We must save our anger for those individuals or parties who committed or planned these crimes. 
Once again, the link to donate to the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund is:http://www.sportsbook.com/redcross.shtml 
And we will match your donation, dollar for dollar.
Sincerely,
The staff at sportsbook.com

"NYISO Statement On External ICAP from ISO-NE (Not a Draft)","
JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:




JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:




ISO-NE has a filing pending at FERC to eliminate their ability to recall
energy from Resources selling ICAP into NY.  If FERC approves the filing,
the ISO will accept up to 350 MW of ICAP from the ISO-NE control area,
subject to the maximum 2558 MW of Installed Capacity located outside the
NYCA in accordance with Attachment B of the Installed Capacity Manual.
Installed Capacity in this context will be in the form of the ICAP
equivalent of the qualified Unforced Capacity (UCAP) sold, consistent with
the ICAP equivalent calculations in Attachment J of the ICAP Manual.

ISO-NE has requested an effective date for its filing of October 22 so FERC
is not expected to approve the ISO-NE tariff changes before then. The next
ICAP Supplier and LSE certifications are due to the NYISO on October 23.
The deficiency auction is scheduled on October 25. In accordance with the
last paragraph of Section 4.9.3 of the ICAP Manual, the ISO plans to open
the period for requesting such rights at 8:00 a.m. on October 18 and close
the request period at 5:00 p.m on October 22. This request period is
conditioned on a timely approval of the elimination of
recall rights by ISO-NE.

Resources located in New England (as well as PJM or HQ) that want to
qualify as ICAP Suppliers in New York must comply with the equirements set
forth in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.9 of the ICAP Manual. The NYISO
encourages Resources to submit DMNC test results, Operating Data and other
required information as soon as possible to allow their participation in
the ICAP market if and when the Commission approves the elimination of the
recall procedures in New England.

"Enron Policies on Equal Employment, Harassment Prevention and Fair Treatment","
Management and employees both have roles in meeting Enron's commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and Harassment Prevention.  To achieve Enron's vision, we need to recruit, select, retain, and manage the most talented people effectively.  We expect all employees to demonstrate Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence in the workplace.  Our efforts to achieve equal employment, and prevent harassment for all employees will guide us towards ensuring that each employee and organization is as productive, inventive, and competitive as possible in a world of changes.

Enron is an equal employment opportunity (EEO) employer.  In choosing to do business with federal, state, and city government agencies, Enron implements affirmative action plans (AAP) to recruit, retain, and promote women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and covered veterans.  Our efforts are inclusive and based on sound business practices, individual qualifications and merit.  Employee and management conduct is expected to be inclusive and equitable in all aspects of the workplace, including recruitment, applicant screening, hiring, training, assignments, compensation, benefits, job performance evaluation, disciplinary action, separation, and the like.  There is no place at Enron for management practices that include bias, favoritism, discrimination, harassment, or conduct that otherwise violates the law or Company policy.

Enron's Harassment Prevention Policy was developed to prevent harassment and help all employees to maintain a productive and mutually rewarding work relationship.  Harassment of any type, including sexual harassment, is contrary to our policy and preventable with education and respectful personal behavior.  We want all employees to know what harassment is, how to prevent it and how to report it.  Our policy outlines these unacceptable behaviors and helps employees better understand work-related expectations and steps.  Every employee at Enron is expected to prevent harassment and report it if it happens.  

Enron's Fair Treatment Policy was developed to provide and maintain a work environment in which all employees are treated equitably.  Our goal is to resolve employment disputes promptly, informally and (where possible) at the lowest level.  Employees who believe they are treated unfairly are encouraged to discuss the matter with their immediate supervisor.  When a concern of unfair, unlawful or unsafe treatment is raised, it will be investigated thoroughly and promptly.  An effective resolution will be reached based on all the information.  The Company will take reasonable steps to ensure confidentiality, but must act on assertions indicating that a violation of policy or law has occurred.

Each of these policies is available for review at http://home.enron.com/resources.  Please familiarize yourself with these policies.  Enron expects and encourages every worker to report workplace issues of concern.  If you need to speak with anyone someone regarding these policies or if an incident occurs that concerns you, please talk with your supervisor, contact your Human Resources representative, or call Enron's Office of Labor and Employment Relations Department at 713-853-7573.  Management is expected to ensure retaliation does not occur.  In addition, Cindy Olson, as  is Enron's EEO officer.  As and  Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Community Relations, Cindy has the responsibility, authority, and full support of Enron to ensure that all employees can avail themselves of our policies.

Your support of respectful workplace relationships adds to a productive and rewarding work environment.  In turn, such personal and organizational success adds to Enron's business success.

Thank you.

To contribute our personal best at Enron, our conduct must promote respectful and co-operative work relationships.  Workplace harassment conflicts with Enron's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:
Be able to recognize harassment
Learn to take precautions against being harassed
Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
Know how to address a situation involving harassment
Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with Enron Values

Go to <http://elm.enron.com> to sign up for the session of your choice.  Harassment Avoidance is listed in the Compliance Category.  If you have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713-853-0357.

"Datek's September 2001 Insite","The Datek Difference
Are we in it for the money? Not when it comes to ""payment for order 
flow""--an industry practice that can create conflicts of interest 
between brokerage firms and their clients. Learn how Datek's dynamic 
Auto Routing bucks this system--and also lets us rebate millions to 
our customers. Where we stand on ""Payment for Order Flow"" 
The Learning Curve
There sure is a lot of talk about over and under in the stock market. 
For example, technical analysts (chartists) look for stocks that are 
either over bought or over sold. And value investors seek stocks that 
are undervalued, in the hopes that they'll soon become fairly valued 
(or even over valued!). But one of the lessons we soon learn is that 
these terms are always relative, and that historical comparisons can 
be misleading. To help make sense of valuations these days, take a 
useful look at ""It's All Relative"" from Smart Money University.* It's All Relative 
Customer Corner
If you never ask, you can never learn. Datek appreciates and responds 
to all the questions we receive from our customers. Here's one that we 
think may be on the minds of many traders. Customer Corner: Real questions from our customers...answered by real

"UCAP Translated In-City Cap Applicable to Mitigated Generators: $112.95","
ADesell@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

As directed by FERC in its September 4, 2001 Order in docket
ER01-2536-000, the NYISO has completed the calculation of the revenue
neutral translation into Unforced Capacity terms of the In-City $105 cap
applicable to Generators subject to market power mitigation measures.  In
the September 4, 2001 Order, the Commission decided that the ""translated
in-city price cap is to be fixed at an amount determined on the day of the
first in-city capacity auction under UCAP methodology"" using data from the
most recent 12-month period.  On the basis of Operating Data received by
the NYISO, the Capacity-weighted EFORd for all Generators subject to
market power mitigation measures for the 2001-2002 Winter Capability
Period Auction is 7.04%.  Thus, the In-City cap under the UCAP market
design, including the Capability Period Auction scheduled for October 1,
2001, is $112.95.

"New Dialing Instructions","
To:          All Enron Houston Users
 
Subject:   New Dialing Instructions
 
Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed.
 
What This Change Means To You
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area.
 
To re-program an Auto-Dial button:
 
?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys
?         Press the Program button on your soft keys
?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program
?         Dial the new Dial String (as identified below)
?         Press the # key
 
REVISED DIAL STRINGS FOR ENRON TIE LINE NETWORK
Users must dial 8 digits to call via Tie Lines

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals
The EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals team is proud to announce the launch of its new ""Morning Briefing"" report.  The report is aimed at providing traders, mid marketers and originators with a detailed yet concise overview of factors impacting the oil and products markets in the previous 24 hours and how these factors are likely to affect the market in the coming day.  In addition to market moving news items, the report contains key market data such as prices, MMBtu curves, refinery outages, open interest analysis and various other market driving information.  The report is updated by 7.30 a.m. each day and can be found on the Crude and Products Fundamentals intranet at <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/> under In House Analysis, Morning Briefing.

EES Business Center 
The Business Center is ready to receive and track all customer leads and service issues. EES needs a single point of entry for all customer calls and issues to ensure customer satisfaction. Starting today, please route all general inquiry calls to our Business Center to provide each customer with consistent and effective assistance. The number for the Center is 800-337-7827 (800-EES-SVCS) or calls can be transferred to x59390.  You may also contact them through e-mail at EESBusinessCenter@enron.com. 

In the event that an account, partner, utility or vendor's activity affects EES' interests, an URGENT ISSUE request should be filed immediately. Such activity includes change in credit rating, bankruptcy filings, high risk shut-off notices, health and safety concerns, possible litigation, etc. File the relevant information by either phone or e-mail and note it as an URGENT ISSUE to enable the Business Center to act immediately.  

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting
Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. 

Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days:

ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million
EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million
EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000
EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 

If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox.  

We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com. 


IN THE NEWS    

Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8

Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13.

California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand.

``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy
Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented:

- Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, 
- Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry
- All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections.

The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets.

 ""This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000,"" says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron's Cadeo project team.  ""We're pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities.""

GasMarktFax Stirs ""Trouble"" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market
Following on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market:  

European Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October.  The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month's release of Enron's GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers.  ""Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs,"" said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative.  ""However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position.  Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice,"" Helge-Jurgen added.

Enron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland
Enron's Polish team have signed the company's first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement.

The 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland's largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland.

The deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule.

""This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland,"" declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.

""This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland,"" adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron's vice-president and head of the Polish office.  A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible.""

EBS Celebrates Neos Deal
Congratulations to EBS who secured a deal with Neos, a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within London and other UK cities (known as metro connectivity). The transaction gives Enron instant access to London's metro network, which expands Enron's coverage. The agreement involves a  ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity.
 
Marcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: ""We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices.""

Launch of Nordic precipitation index
In another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations.  The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity.  Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers.  The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions.  For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall.  The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden).

On the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region.  

Given the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market.  In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years).  The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.

As requested by Jim Parmelee of LIPA the following is posted to the TIE
list.

Subject: AMP on Long Island


After several curious questions and comments, LIPA has decided to
provide
this information on a one time basis.

According to the NYISO, on July 23 and 24, the AMP process was activated
on
Long Island in the DAM and mitigation took place.  LIPA has confirmed,
contrary to popular perception, that no LIPA units were mitigated under
the
AMP.

The AMP triggered for Long Island during hours beginning 15, 16, and 17
in
the Day-Ahead Market for July 23, 2001.  Mitigation took place as a
result
of verification of conduct and impact.

Chuck,
     I understand (barely)the mechanism which predicts/solves the
voltage
constraints, my problem is more coming from the price visibility side.
It's like
driving down the road with a speedometer swinging between 55 and 85 and
a cop
sitting in the medium. Do you speed up or slow down? Going the wrong way
could
get you a day in court. Multiple units OOM, Gen bid guarantees, BME' s
$900 in
every zone, hugh positive congestion one hour, hugh negative congestion
the next
(Zone P), RT prices $60-90 and neighboring ISO's in the high hundreds
(PJM) and
$1000 for three hours in ISONE and one can only wait and see what the
uplift
was. I may get my cocker spaniel to stick his head out the window and
use the
elevation of his ears as a speed estimate. How the heck does one drive
in the
NYISO market?

"Turbine  Change out Letter","At the recent DES meeting, I was given the assignment to draft a letter that could be used as a courtesy notification to state agencies of turbine change outs.  (This is for states where permitting is not required for turbine change outs.)  Attached is that letter.  The parenthetical comments are added to explain certain aspects of the letter and would not be included in the letter.  At a minimum, this letter will be sent for all turbine change outs.

"Re: RTO Meeting tidbits","
Aaron Breidenbaugh <aaron@global2000.net> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

As promised. Here is what I have learned.

I spoke with Judge Young earlier today and was told that entities that
are not yet intervenors in the Northeast RTO proceeding may attend the
meeting next Tuesday. Initially, the Judge will poll parties present as
to their status. Those that are already intervenors in the underlying
dockets need do nothing more, they are considered intervenors to the
RT01-99 proceeding already. Those who are not already intervenors will
be admitted as parties, provided there are no objections. If there are
any objections, the objecting party(ies) and the party seeking
admittance will be given a brief opportunity to state their cases and
the Judge will issue a ruling.

As to filing for party status with the Commission, it is still not clear
(and the Judge did not provide guidance) whether parties should file ""in
time"" in docket RT01-99 or ""out of time"" in one of the underlying RTO
dockets. The safest bet might be to file under both. In either case, the
mediation process may well be concluded before FERC acts on such
intervention requests. Thus, attending the meeting and resolving party
status at that time would seem to provide the quickest, surest answer.
However, I'm not a lawyer and that is not legal advice.... ;-)

Finally, my understanding is that, regardless of how many days the rooms
are reserved for, the meeting next week is for two days only, Tuesday
and Wednesday. The substance of the mediation meetings, once
interventions are sorted out, will be to develop a business plan,
milestones and timeline -- in short a process -- for developing a region
wide RTO. It does not appear that substantive answers to the myriad
issues surrounding the move to a Northeast RTO are likely to be sought
during the mediation period.

Hopefully this is helpful for you.

"NYISO - MIS Outage - October 17, 2001 - Reminder Notice","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

*****Reminder Notice************

Dear Market Participants

On October 17, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible
as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.  Ultimately,
these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You
Customer Relations

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists were:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mission; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBridge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give testimony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week.  What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energy market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.    

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Schmuel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Carol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should try a couple of different systems and see what works.  

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not physical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissioner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could work together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it's okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premise, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or flowgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not agreed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstances change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable.  

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates) should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on which instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs being allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front.  

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

"Important Information About Security & ClickAtHome","
Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.  
BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.
If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email clickathome@enron.com.  Thank you for your participation in ClickAtHome.
The ClickAtHome Team!

"FW: Move Related Issues","

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

"Lay It On the Line","
At the all-employee meeting two weeks ago, I talked about the major challenges that I believe Enron is currently facing and what we are doing to address these issues.  I also reviewed with you our vision for Enron to become ""The World's Leading Company,"" and what that means to me.

Your management team and I remain committed to this goal and are confident that by working together, we can achieve this vision.  After the all-employee meeting, a number of you came forward to voice your concerns about what you saw as additional challenges for Enron, and for that, I thank you.  We have already begun working on many of the concerns you expressed.  Now, I would like to hear from more of you about what you see as the most critical issues facing Enron in the next twelve months.  In other words, ""Lay It on the Line"" for me by completing the attached survey.

I assure you that your individual answers to this survey will remain confidential.  The new Management Committee will use this information to help us identify immediate action steps to address your key concerns.  We will communicate the results to you, both positive and negative, and what we plan to do about them, as soon as we can.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help us move Enron toward its new vision of becoming ""The World's Leading Company.""

We need your answers no later than Tuesday, September 4, 2001.

To access the survey, click on or copy the following URL onto the Enron intranet site: <http://etcsurvey.corp.enron.com/wi/p0731404/i.asp>.  If this link does not work, go to home.enron.com under ""New & Notable"" and click on ""Lay It On the Line.""  If you have problems with the survey, contact the HRGIM Help Desk at 713-853-5666.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EBS Joins EWS
Effective, July 12, EBS has become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  All EBS commercial support functions will be integrated into those units within EWS, which enables us to better manage the resources and costs of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions have been consolidated into the following units:
Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele

Additionally, the North American EBS origination teams have been consolidated into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  North American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to most effectively meet the future needs of EBS and the Portland office will be closed by October 1.


Global Strategic Sourcing
Effective July 1, a number of measures and recommendations have been implemented to reduce expenditures associated with, among other things, travel and entertainment, and professional services.  Global Strategic Sourcing (""GSS"") will undertake this very important initiative and they would like to enlist your support in the implementation of these new procedures.

This message will focus on Travel and entertainment.  Next week's message will focus on professional services.

Travel and Entertainment - Enron has a tremendous opportunity to save on travel and entertainment expenditures by making some relatively painless adjustments.

?	Air Travel - Air transportation is the single largest component in the travel mix.  In recognition of this fact, a number of significant discounts have been negotiated with all of the major carriers.  There are two separate channels available to employees to access the Enron-negotiated fares.  The first is Travel Agency in the Park (""TAP""), or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location, and the second is the new Enron-managed online travel booking service, ClickTrip, located at <http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron>.

Over the coming weeks, GSS will be promoting training and usage of ClickTrip, as the primary method of booking domestic U.S. travel for a number of reasons.  First, excluding proprietary carriers like Southwest Airlines, ClickTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for their destination, including the Enron-negotiated fares.  Second, industry data shows that employees will generally make the most cost-effective travel decision when presented with the relevant facts.  Conservatively speaking, we estimate that a 20% savings in airfare is attainable through the use of this tool alone.  Third, it is relatively painless to use.  Fourth, ClickTrip is accessible 24X7 from any internet-enabled personal computer and after-hours telephone support is available. If you have travel-related questions, please contact Tracy Ramsey at ext. 6-8311.
 
One final air travel reminder worth promoting: For employees who fly in the United States, use of non-refundable coach tickets generally runs 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.

?	Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate your business unit's individual hotel policy. Additionally, preferred car rental rates including insurance coverage with National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.) have been negotiated for your use.  More detailed information is available regarding both programs through our travel site located at <http://travel.enron.com>.

Enron Industrial Markets - Forest Products
EIM began trading in the physical markets for Forest Products (newsprint, pulp, recycled paper, and lumber) in August, 2000 and Steel in January, 2001.  Since then EIM has handled over 140,000 tons of recycled paper, 180,000 tons of newsprint, 150,000 tons of pulp, 160 million board feet of lumber, and 210,000 tons of steel.  Currently on a weekly basis, EIM is moving approximately 20,000 tons of forest products (newsprint, pulp and recycled paper), 3 million board feet of lumber, and 10,000 tons of steel products throughout the world.  

Due to much larger volumes of forward trading, EIM is expanding its physical product delivery capabilities around the world to physically handle 5 million tons per year.  The EIM Logistics Group coordinates the activities of customer service, supply and demand matching, scheduling of owned assets, and physical transport and warehousing.  These activities are primarily coordinated through the Houston office, with additional resources in London and Singapore.

Additionally, EIM owns paper mills in Quebec City and New Jersey which have a combined production capacity of 750,000 tons of newsprint per month, and a cold rolling steel mill in Arkansas with capacity of 400,000 tons per year.  Each of these facilities includes Logistics resources that are coordinated through the EIM Logistics Group.

Enron Global Markets - LNG
Enron Global LNG has enhanced its Atlantic Basin LNG supply portfolio with volumes from Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG).  Enron Global LNG recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with NLNG for delivery of 1 BCM/ year (billion cubic meters) or (97,000 Mcf/day) from the NLNG Plus Project.  This is a two train expansion of NLNG's existing Bonny Island LNG production facility.  The expansion is scheduled for completion in 2005.  This deal represents a major step in the establishment of Enron's global LNG network.

EGM - Finance & Structuring
On June 29, 2001, Enron Global Markets - LNG Group successfully completed the divestiture of its 100% equity interest in Progasco, to CHDR, Inc. via an all cash transaction.  Progasco sells and distributes LPG to commercial and industrial clients, and independent resellers, through a fleet of tanker trucks, bobtail trucks and 13 filling plants throughout Puerto Rico.  CHDR, Inc. is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Tropigas de Puerto Rico, Inc. (""Tropigas"").  Upon completion of this transaction, Tropigas, hitherto the 3rd largest market player will operate the newly consolidated entity and control a 35% market share, becoming the 2nd largest Puerto Rican LPG marketer. 

The sale proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, have been split between Protane (a wholly owned Enron Corp. Delaware subsidiary) and San Juan Gas (SJG), and were used to pay down inter-company debt owed to SJG and Pro Caribe.  The net (pre-tax) gain recorded on the transaction was $3.9 million. 

The profitable sale of this strategic asset allows EGM to exit the retail propane business it inherited through the 1985 merger of three companies: Protane, Petrolane and Imperial Gas, and will enable Enron to better deploy the cash received and more efficiently manage its Puerto Rican human resources. 

EGM - Weather
The Weather group just completed a deal with People's Energy to protect them against lower gas prices during a warmer than normal winter.  This innovative winter protection was structured to manage People's exposure to both the volume and price of natural gas.  Greg Penman and Bob Beyer, from the Chicago office, were the lead dealmakers for this transaction.  Simlar deals with other counterparties are expected to come over the winter season.
Also, the Weather Group has started exploring new opportunities with EES.  To support this effort, Elsa Piekieniak has joined the group.  Elsa is looking for several people to help her with this initiative.  If you're interested in a position, please contact Elsa.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

UPDATE ON ENRON EUROPE'S CONTRIBUTION TO 2ND QUARTER RESULTS
Congratulations to all staff for your contribution to another fantastic quarter!  

By now we hope you will have had an opportunity to read about Enron's Q2 earnings, which were released to the investment community in Houston on Thursday, 12th July.  Overall the business has seen continued strong growth with revenues increasing to over $100 million in the first half of the year up from $30 million for the same period last year.  Earnings per share this quarter also exceeded analyst expectations and came in at $0.45 for the quarter up from $0.34 for the same period last year.

Equally important, however, is the vital role Enron Europe played this quarter in contributing to the company's overall results.   We are seeing some terrific trends here in Europe - notably, on the wholesale side, the Continental, UK and Nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to strength as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this quarter.  Total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in Europe have seen an increase of 172% in the first six months of the year compared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year.  Specifically, UK power volumes are up 204% to 147 TWh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 TWh in the same period last year.  Continental gas volumes have grown from 351 Bbtue/day in 2000 to 1,390 Bbtue/day in 2001 - a 296% increase - and Continental power volumes have seen growth of 360% with volumes rising from 18 TWh in the first six months of 2000 to 83 TWh for the same period this year.  The growth in volumes is not simply limited to the UK and Continental markets, however, as Nordic power volumes have increased by 153% from 29 TWh to 73 TWh in the first half of 2001.

The success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading, however, and abound throughout the business:

Enron Energy Services
The retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the closing of EES' first, major ""marquis"" brand energy outsourcing transaction with supermarket giant, J. Sainsbury plc.  Of equal importance, Enron Direct's business continues to grow with total customers now in excess of 160,000.  The success of Enron Direct's business model has translated into the development of new business on the Continent in the Netherlands and Spain and, more recently in North America, with the 2nd quarter opening of Enron Direct Canada.  

Enron Credit
A year after Enron Credit's launch, the total life to date notional value of transactions has surpassed $11.8 billion and in the 2nd quarter alone, Enron Credit generated $10.4 million in EBIT.  Further, more than 20,000 readers per week view the Enron Cost of Credit (ECC) through independent publications.   

Enron Australia
With 2nd quarter power volumes up 177% from the first three months this year, Enron Australia is gearing up for a strong growth year.  With the development of a physical power position key to expanding Enron's power trading in Australia, work began this quarter to identify and begin the initial pursuit of asset development projects.  Other businesses undergoing significant expansion this quarter were coal, renewable energy credits and weather derivatives. 

Spain:  Arcos
The Arcos asset development project in Spain continues to make great progress with third party access to gas supplies for the power project being successfully negotiated this quarter, plus the project achieved another milestone in the permit/government approvals arena with the granting of its water concession in Q2.

UK:  ETOL
ETOL, a long-standing contributor to Enron Europe's earnings, generated yet another profitable transaction this quarter with the signing of a series of deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies at Wilton International. The transaction further strengthens Enron's relationship with Du Pont, one of ETOL's largest customers, and will extend the current steam and power supply contract through 2010.  

Enron Metals
A year after entering the metals business, Enron Metals has seen increased volumes of 130% in its merchant and financial trading operations this quarter with volumes up to over 3.5 million tonnes as compared to just over 1.5 million tonnes in the 2nd quarter last year.  Not only has the team seen positive growth in volumes this quarter, but they have increased their share of trading on the LME by 50% and are making significant progress with Project Salem - a major IT and systems improvement project that will streamline deal capture and risk management for metals transactions.  Finally, the metals team achieved a true home run this quarter when they closed a major ten-year origination transaction that, through the addition of smelting assets, will enable the metals team to improve its trading position.  The transaction proved to be the perfect opportunity to leverage all of Enron's trading and origination capabilities and involved input from a number of groups across Enron.   

Looking to the future, we have every expectation that the strong growth we've witnessed in Europe for the first half of the year will continue through end 2001.  So, in the words of Solomon Smith Barney analyst, Ray Niles, when talking about Enron's European wholesale operations results this quarter, ""Europe is kicking butt and it's about a quarter of [Enron's] activity, nearly double what it was last year.  And, that is a new market that is the size of the US.""

OPAL: OCTOBER'S BIRTHSTONE
==========================
Among the ancients, opal was a symbol of fidelity and
assurance, and in later history it became strongly associated
with religious emotion and prayer.  It was believed to have a
strong therapeutic value for diseases of the eye, and worn as
an amulet it would make the wearer immune from them as well
as increase the powers of the eyes and the mind.

When we describe the opal, we realize how insufficient the
English language is.  It is unique among the gems, displaying
an array of very brilliant miniature rainbow effects, all
mixed together.  Its most outstanding characteristic is this
unusual, intense display of many colors flashing out like
mini-rainbows.  This effect is created by opal's formation
process, which is very different from that of other gems.
Opal is composed of hydrated silica spheres.  The mini-
rainbows seen in most opals result from light interference
created by these spheres.  The arrangement of the spheres,
which vary in size and pattern, is responsible for the
different colors.

Opal is usually cut flat or in cabochon, since there is no
additional brilliance to be captured by faceting.  In opals,
color is everything.  The more brilliant the color, the more
valuable the gem.  It is probably truer of opal than any other
stone that the more beautiful the stone and its color, the
more it will cost.

One word of caution must be offered: Opals require special
care because some tend to dry and crack.  Avoid exposure to
anything that is potentially drying.  And, believe it or not,
rubbing it periodically with an oil-moistened cloth--such as
olive oil--will help preserve it.  Do not soak it; soaking
some opals for only a few hours can cause them to lose some
or nearly all of their fire.

GOLD & SILVER BURIED BENEATH WTC RUINS
=================================================
Some 11.8 metric tons of gold worth an estimated
$110 million and 30.2 million ounces of silver valued at
$121 million are buried in the rubble below one of the
collapsed buildings in the World Trade Center, The New
York Times reported.

The precious metal was stored in vaults below 4 World
Trade Center, the paper said. It belongs to people or
firms that trade futures contracts on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.

A metric ton is equal to about 2,205 pounds.

The Times quoted James Newsome, acting chairman of the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which oversees
futures markets, as saying there was not much concern
about the gold and silver ``because the metal is secure
and because there is ample supply.''

Even if for some reason the gold can't be recovered,
there's plenty of supply in the world. One company
estimated the trade center hoard to be 0.3 percent of
the global supply, the Associated Press (AP) reported.

The precious metals are used to settle trading in
futures contracts, the AP reported. Futures traders
generally don't want the actual gold; instead they're
buying contracts based on it to hedge or speculate.


DIAMOND SHAPES AND CUT
===============================
We recently updated our web site and, in particular,
revised the sections on diamond shapes and diamond cut.
Check out some of the unique shapes that you might not
have seen before at http://www.dsourceva.com/shape.htm

We also upgraded the section on cut to include a more
thorough discussion of ideal cut proportions and how the
definition of ideal cut varies by grading laboratory.
Check this out at http://www.dsourceva.com/cut.htm


PLATINUM DEMAND FOR JEWELRY FALLS
==========================================
Soaring platinum prices caused jewelry demand for the
metal to fall for the first time in 16 years, the
Platinum 2001 survey by Johnson Matthey reports.

Platinum prices that topped $600 caused price
sensitivity in the low-end market, the report says.
It predicts manufacturers may shift to lighter-weight
designs or lower-priced white gold.

Overall, jewelry demand for platinum declined by 1%
last year, due to weakness in the Japanese market. In
the U.S., demand for platinum jumped 15%, because of
the fashion trend towards white metal jewelry. The
report notes there was particularly strong growth in
platinum wedding bands. Manufacturers also introduced
lightweight platinum rings to meet mass-market price
points.

The outlook for platinum in the U.S. in 2001 is mixed,
the report said. While it expects platinum to continue
to make inroads in the jewelry market, it won't be
at the same growth as previous years.


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:
http://www.dsourceva.com/cost.htm#calc


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
===============
Name The Star of Sierra Leone
Weight: 968.90 carats rough

Valentine's Day, 1972.   A routine workday at the diamond
mine in Sierra Leone.  Suddenly, a company engineer and a
plant security officer spot something big on the grease table
(grease sticks to diamonds and is used to separate diamonds
from ore).  At first, neither man could believe what they
saw.  There, trapped by the grease, is a huge diamond, the
size of a hen's egg.

When the stone is first offered for sale, none of the sealed
bids reaches the minimum price of more than $2.5 million set
by the government.  Finally, months later, Harry Winston
makes a deal for the Star.  Winston wants a world-class
diamond from his rough.  A 143.20 carat emerald cut is
fashioned, but upon close examination, it reveals inclusions.
Winston changes his mind, deciding that flawlessness is
more important than size.

The big diamond is recut into seven smaller stones, the
largest of which weighs 32.52 carats.  Besides these, the
rough yields 10 other stones ranging from 1.85 to 53.96
carats.  All told, Winston recovers only 238.48 carats, a
staggering loss of almost 75 percent.  But 13 of the 17
finished stones are reportedly flawless.


BOW-TIE
=======================
Face-up, many marquises, pears, and ovals show a dark
shadow resembling a bow-tie running widthwise across the
center of the table.  This is especially common in shallow
or very deep stones; but slightly deep pavilions sometimes
eliminate it.  On the other hand, as the difference between
length and width increases, and pavilion angle variations
become more extreme, the bow-tie tends to get darker.

The size and darkness of the bow-tie is significant.  It
is best examined face-up under normal lighting conditions
with the unaided eyes.  The significance of the bow-tie
is usually noted as slight, noticeable, or obvious.

For these oblong fancy shaped diamonds, we find a
noticeable or obvious bow-tie can be a serious distraction
and should be avoided.  Since there is no way to
determine bow-tie from the specifications of the diamond,
personal inspection is the only way to determine the
impact of this characteristic.

Photos of this bow-tie effect can be seen at
http://www.dsourceva.com/cut.htm


GEM OF THE DAY
==================================
Keep smiling.  Even when life knocks you flat on your back,
you are still in a good position to look up.


BIG TICKET ITEMS BRACE FOR SLUMP
===========================================
Retailers of luxury items like jewelry, cars, art and
antiques are all bracing themselves for a sharp decline
in sales a result of a bonus squeeze on Wall Street.

About 60 percent to 65 percent of fine jewelry sales rely
on impulse buying, according to Shay Strager, a jewelry
stylist and trend forecaster for Goldstein Communications.
The industry is now revising its marketing strategy to
try and attract more customers.

""We've abandoned our marketing efforts that revolve around
fashion and trend tie-ins to focus on the symbolic nature
of fine jewelry: sentimentality and bridal jewelry,
hand-me-down pieces that can last for generations,""
Strager said.


INTERNET MARKETING TOOLS
========================
If you or any of your friends and associates have a web site
and want to attract more visitors, we have found some exciting
tools that are on the leading edge of internet marketing.
Check out the information at the following web page:
http://www.dsourceva.com/internetmarketing.htm


DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS
=========================
One of the best ways to be a better shopper for diamonds and
fine jewelry is to read one or more of the great books
listed at the following web page:
http://www.dsourceva.com/books.htm

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Ready2Go","Are you Ready2Go ?

Have you ever experienced problems accessing the network remotely when traveling on business or when trying to work from home on your Enron laptop?  Would you like someone to test and customize the dial-up access on your laptop before you head out of town on your next trip? 

We have identified a need and are now supplying a new service for Corp and EBS employees and it's called Ready2Go !

This new service has been established to test, modify, and update the dial-up software on your laptop.

How it works:

A calendar has been created on ITCentral at <http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/Ready2Go>

Go to the site and schedule a time that is convenient for you. Then, bring your laptop to our testing site, (either at 3AC105 or EB2268D).  We will examine your system, update your software (if needed) and even customize it for the next location you will be traveling to.  We'll also provide a training session in accessing the network remotely with your laptop.

If you are interested in participating, simply access the web site and schedule an appointment.

Thank you for your time.
The Ready2Go Team

"TEESSIDE POWER STATION -- UPDATE","
The funerals of Andy, Darren and Paul, who tragically lost their lives in last Wednesday's explosion at Teesside Power Station, will be held this week at the following times:

Andy Sherwood	2.00pm, Wednesday, August 15
St  James Church, Hartlepool

Darren Higgins	9.15 am, Thursday, August 16
St. Andrews Church, Teesville, Middlesbrough

Paul Surtees		1.30 pm, Thursday, August 16
Easington Church of the Ascension, Easington Colliery

We know that everyone at Enron will want to remember the colleagues we have lost at this difficult time, and our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends.

We are considering how best to commemorate the lives of Andy, Darren and Paul, and will be discussing our ideas with their families, in due course.

Graeme White is recovering in Middlesbrough General Hospital where his condition remains stable and we are continuing to provide as much support as possible for Graeme and his family.

The plant remains off-line and Enron continues to co-operate fully with the Health & Safety Executive's investigation into the cause of the explosion.

"FW: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel","

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's ""RTO Week"" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was ""RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets.""  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

"Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","
The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

"WESCO Checkouts","Campbell,

We had a discrepancy with WESCO on our checkouts for 9/23/2001.  WESCO shows all 100 MW with the following path:

SCEG-SCEGW135074F50/50-SCEG-DYPMI - WESCO ---E--- MORGAN  - SOCO-SOCOW/S

WESCO does not recognize the schedule with the following path for 25MW:

MDU-CARGILL-MAPPW-AMRNW-TVAW-CARG-SCEG-DYPMI - WESCO ---E--- MORGAN  - SOCO-SOCOW/S  

We both agree that 100 MW should sink at SOCO, however, they show all 100 coming from SCEG into SOCO, and we show 75 from SCEG to SOCO and 25 from MDU to SOCO.  Let me know if I need to make any changes.

Thanks,

"September 20, 2001 Residuals","
RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

This notice is to inform Transmission Customers that the September 20, 2001
OATT Schedule 1 residual adjustments are artificially inflated in the first
version of the advisory billing statements.  A file used in the computation
of subzonal loads was not loaded prior to the billing run making it appear
as though no load existed in some subzones.  This  causes all DAM scheduled
purchases and bilateral transactions serving load in the affected subzones
to be sold back in the Balancing Market.  This creates an under-collection
which is then recovered from the market through the balancing energy,
losses, & congestion residuals .  The 20th will be rerun as soon as price
corrections and metered MWh values have been reconciled.  The NYISO
apologizes for any inconvenience caused by this problem.

Randy A. Bowers

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

"eThink About It: 07/30/01","


Karen Denne, vice president of Public Relations, received some interesting questions about Enron's dealings with the media in her eSpeak session on July 24.  Here's one of them:

I am new to Enron, and the ""pie in the face"" incident occurred just after I began working here. I have had several friends ask me about that. My questions are: 1) How did we ""spin"" this issue (i.e., the problems with Cal. AND the fact that we got pie thrown on one of our main players) 2) Was he mad about it, or did he laugh it off? 3) Is this a pie incident kind of a good thing, because it gets people talking about the issues and Enron or do we look silly?

"2001 Chairman's Award","Once again it is time to begin the nomination process for Enron's Chairman's Award.  

For those of you who are new to Enron, the Chairman's award is an employee-driven award designed to recognize Enron employees who make a difference in our organization by demonstrating our core values - Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence - in everything they do.  These individuals are the Everyday Heroes who make Enron a great place to work. They capture the spirit, the philosophy and the day-to-day business practices of our company in their work, their attitude and how they regard their colleagues.  

This award program will only be as successful as your participation in it.  All Enron employees can nominate fellow employees at any level - from the top down or the bottom up.  

Nomination forms will be available around the world.  Find the forms on your intranet site or at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  Direct any questions to mbx_chairmansaward@enron.com

The nomination process is simple.  Complete and submit the nomination form by Wednesday, October 10, 2001.  This year's Selection Committee will then review all nominations and present recommendations to the Office of the Chairman for final approval.

The Chairman's Award winner and finalists will be announced at the annual Enron Management Conference in San Antonio, Texas on November 16, 2001. 

I want to personally encourage each of you to think about your colleagues, their contributions to Enron and their adherence to our values.  If there is someone you know who is one of our many ""everyday heroes"" and you think they deserve to be recognized for their dedication and commitment to Enron's values, now is your turn to speak up?so please take the time to nominate someone you know for this very special award.

I look forward to learning more about our outstanding employees here at Enron and thank you for your participation.

"results of the football pool","Hello everyone,

	We already have a winner in this week's football pool. Rudy Acevedo only missed 5 games and picked Minnesota in tonight's game, while the other people who missed 6 games, all picked Minnesota as well tonight. There were 21 people who played this week, making the prize $63. 

	Among the games widely missed were: in college, mainly just the Alabama/Auburn game; in the pros, Atlanta/Green Bay; NY Jets/Miami; Cleveland/Baltimore; Washington/Denver and Chicago/Tampa Bay. 

	With the short week this week, there will not be a pool this coming weekend. We will resume next week. Here are the amount of games missed by each person who played this week.

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

"RE: WGR Responsibility for Gomez facility.","I received a call from WGR (Bruce Ports 303-450-8401) on Tuesday 12/18.  Seems no permits were filed for the Gomez, Oates or Pikes Peak treaters (which were not running) during the period WGR was operating the plant for us.  WGR did file title V paperwork and paid fees for the Gomez compression that was operating.  Probably no harm since the plants weren't running, but may be a technical violation.  Bruce asked me for some history of operation which I gave him verbally [i.e. Intratex (an Enron affiliate) operated for NNG prior to WGR].  One point I stressed, was that we believed the operating agreement obligated WGR to file any required environmental permits (with or without NNG reminding them) and that NNG was deliberate in not performing duties that WGR was paid to perform.

Subject:	WGR Responsibility for Gomez facility.

Guys, with respect to the above, as you know, WGR was responsible for all compliance submittals during the time that we owned and they operated.  I know in the past, prior to their taking over ownership, I would remind them each year that a particular document was requried.  I figured that when they became owners, they didnt need me anymore.  Louie, you are right, Phil Moyer was the environmental contact for WGR and he was the one I would contact and apprise.  It just so happens that I have copies of previous annual submittals from WGR for the Gomez facility  when the facility was under our ownership, their responsibility.  I even have a copy of the Title V Permit.  When I was told that we no longer owned the faclity, I sent all information I had to WGR, but kept copies of the stuff I had, just in case.  I can send it one more time if you want me too.  Let me know.....

"Need you feed back please!!!","Hello Folks,

Sorry for the resend, but the quite a few of them were bounced back to me, so I
fixed the email addresses!

The following attachment is a trip to Port Aransas (near Corpus Christi).  The
regular price of a Saturday trip is $29.95.  The special  price is only $8 and a

minimum of 45 persons to from a trip.  Another condition is that each person
have to be 21 or older.  The price includes donuts, snack, a bottle water,
prizes & a free lunch buffet and free bingo.

Please shoot me back an email to let me know the interest for this event.  We're

looking at Oct. 6.  The costs for non-members would be a bit higher.  I will
also take any other suggestions for an event.  By the way, please only reply to
me and spare the others!

Take care all and have a wonderful weekend.  I know I will, I'm playing golf all

weekend!!!

"Travel Security Update","
As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.

"Corporate Security Message","
An old scam has surfaced recently with renewed vigor.  The Nigerian-419 fraud letter, so called because it violates section 419 of Nigerian law, is sent in many variations, by surface and airmail as well as by fax and email.  Generally the form it takes is to ask the unsuspecting victim to provide their bank account information in return for a promise to deposit a very large sum of money into that account under some pretext.

Employees should be advised that any information given will be used to further promote the scam through the emptying out of bank accounts, counterfeit and forged checks being written against the accounts, and for other illegal purposes.

If you receive what you believe to be one of these letters, forward it to Mike Hicks (Michael.Hicks@enron.com).  Corporate Security maintains a file on them, and works with the US Secret Service to reduce the number of letters received by our employees.

For more information on these letters, please email or call Mike at (713) 853-6198.

Please take this extended opportunity to nominate that special individual who is your everyday hero and a role model who exemplifies Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.

This award represents how important Enron's core values are to the company. The success of this award program is determined by Enron's most valuable asset, you, the employee. Employees at any level can nominate fellow employees from anywhere within the Enron family - from the top down or the bottom up. All of those employees who have been nominated in the past are eligible to be nominated again this year and there is no limit to the number of nominations you may submit. Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by Friday, October 12, 2001. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com and in Houston they are available in the elevator lobbies. In addition, this year we have a new way you can nominate that everyday Enron hero. Simply pick up the phone and dial 713-345-2492, follow the simple and quick instructions and leave your nomination by phone.

The finalists for the award, the Chairman's Roundtable, and the Chairman's Award winner will be honored at Enron's Management Conference in San Antonio on November 15.

"Virtual Bidding Seminars - Oct 16 & 29 - Be Ready for the New Market","
AStorey@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

NYISO opens its Virtual Marketplace on November 1. Whether you've
registered to participate in it, are considering doing so, or are
interested in its potential impact on the existing markets, you'll want to
attend one of the two upcoming seminars scheduled for October 16 and 29.

The programs will cover:
     NYISO bidding fundamentals - a short overview for those new to the
NYISO marketplace
     Virtual Transaction basics
     Virtual Transaction entry
     Virtual Transaction charges
     Billing
     Credit requirements
     Illustrations and examples
     Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions

Each one-day program will be intensive and practical. It will address your
virtual bidding options and the impact these bids will have on prices in
both the day-ahead and real-time markets. It will give you a good picture
as to how this market works and how your participation may be advantageous
to you.

The day-ahead and real-time markets will change as a result of this new
option. Therefore, this course will be extremely valuable, not only to
those bidding virtual transactions, but also to everyone bidding load or
supply in the existing energy markets.

The course will be run on the following dates as indicated:
     October 16     Albany Marriott, 189 Wolf Road, Albany, New York
     October 29     Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road, Albany, New York

Course Registration will begin at 8:00 am and the course will start at 8:30
am. Wrap-up each day will be by 4:00 pm.

Register for the seminar through our web site at:

"results of football pool","Hello Everyone, 

	This week again saw some upsets, both in college and pro games, however, the overall results were better this week than the past few weeks. In the college games, it was split between the Oklahoma and Nebraska game as far as who got it right, the Auburn/Arkansas game and UCLA/Stanford game were both missed by most people. Quite a few people also missed the Oregon/Washington St. game. 
In the pros, the New Orleans/St.Louis game was missed by just about everyone, everyone missed the NY Giants/Washington game, the Minnesota/Tampa Bay game was missed by quite a few people, and the Arizona/Dallas game was also missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Rob Benson is currently in the lead with only 5 games missed. Rob also picked Pittsburgh tonight. Still alive for the money with 6 games missed are Joe Quenet and Jeff Miller, who both picked Tennessee tonight. There were also 3 other people who have 6 wrong, however, they all chose Pittsburgh tonight. Therefore, if Pittsburgh wins tonight, then Rob will win outright. If Tennessee wins tonight, then it will come down to total points. Rob chose 38 points, Joe has 48 points and Jeff has 34 points. Therefore Jeff will win with a Tennessee victory and 35 or fewer total points, 36 he will tie with Rob. Rob will also win if Tennessee wins and the total points are from 37-42 and he will also tie with Joe at 43 points. Joe will win if Tennessee wins and there is 44 or more total points scored, 43 he will split with Rob. 

	We raised the entry fee to $3 per entry this week and will continue that for the rest of the season unless enough people want it back down to $2. We had 34 entries this weekend, therefore the prize money is $102 !!  There is no Thursday night game this upcoming week, therefore this coming week's picks will be due on Friday. Following is each person who played this week with the amount of games they missed.

"Orders issued today in NYISO and ISO-NE proceedings","Today FERC issued the following draft orders:

NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.  

NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.

NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made ""but for"" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  

ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.

Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.

"Fw: 911","
 
This was forwarded to me from a  friend.  Kinda weird.
 
Karen
This is really sick. This is an internet newsgroup where a guy as early as  Aug 31 claims something horrific was about to happen in the United States. Read  this entire interaction between a guy named Xin and a few others. Pay REAL close  attention to the dates of the message and the SUBJECT lines. This newsgroup  thing will probably make the news as early as tonight - so check it out. This  guy was obviously involved or new those involved in the whole incident.
 
This is not a joke. 
 
God Bless the Victims.

"Adjustments to 7/2000, 8/2000, & 3/2001 Settlement Adjustment Invoices","
RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Total NYISO MWh for use in the denominator of your ratio share computations
are as follows:

March 2001:    13,677,199 MWh
July 2000:     14,144,257 MWh
August 2000:   14,854,861 MWh

A short-cut to computing your monthly MWh is to divide your total ""fixed""
Schedule 1 or NTAC costs by the respective monthly rates.

                                         Adjustment Invoices




The NYISO will be posting invoices later today for the initial settlements
of July 2001 and the 1st settlement adjustments of July 2000, August 2000,
& March 2001.  Transmission Customers will observe the following
adjustments to their settlements.

Adjustments have been made to Transmission Customers' invoices to recover
the costs related adjustments made to customer settlements outside of the
billing process and to adjust the NYISO clearing account balance to zero
for each month invoiced.

Prior to October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the
revenue received from Schedule 1 charges, which were comprised of
forecasted uplift & residual adjustments, and  the costs actually incurred
by adjusting subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.  In October
2000, the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions
that allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In order to allow any changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be
settled through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in
October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.  This results in
an over-collection which is being returned to Customers through an
adjustment to their monthly balances.  This billing treatment for July 2000
and August 2000 settlement adjustments resulted in credits to the market
totaling $7,700,605.23 and $32,146,310.55, respectively.  Customers where
paid their share of these adjustments based upon their respective ratio
shares of NYISO load for each month.  This adjustment provides for the
settlement of all accounts in the market in the month(s) the costs or
over-collections were realized and adjusts the NYISO clearing account
balance impact to zero for each month.

Adjustments have also been made to Transmission Customers' invoices to
recover the costs related adjustments made to customer settlements outside
of the billing process.  These adjustments totalled $964,548.42 for March
2001, $375,110.49 for July 2000 and $48,973.41 for August 2000. Customers
where allocated their share in these costs based upon their respective
ratio shares of NYISO load for each month.

Regards,
Randy A. Bowers
Manager - Customer Settlements

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Risk Markets (GRM) is pleased to announce the financial close of Project Ranch. This transaction involved an insurance wrap on a Volumetric Production Payment (VPP) consummated by Enron Capital Resources in February 2001. As part of this deal, Enron was able to successfully syndicate upstream reserve and operations risk to the insurance markets. The convergence of Insurance and Capital Markets is still a novel concept in the world of finance and Enron is proud to be one of the first companies to be involved in a transaction of this kind. Special mention should be made of the GRM deal team (Doug Jones, Rafi Khan, Tony Wolfe, Sebastien Saubier, Brian Cohen) and of the Global Finance team (Tim Proffitt, Nora Dobin, Chris Herron, Ying Liu) for their very hard work and dedication to the deal. 


Enron Engineering and Operational Services
Since May, EEOS has been providing operational support at the Cuiaba, Brazil facility, a 450 MW combined cycle plant.  Our team members have consisted of John Krupski and Yaser Tobeh from the Houston office, Don Schmidt from New Albany, Derrick Skerritt and Howard Peel from our Teeside operations in the UK.  

John, Yaser, Don, Derrick and Howard have been providing operational and maintenance support at the project, as well as providing mentor/coaching support for the staff. They have been instrumental in developing and implementing a team building approach at the facility and trying to instill a sense of ownership with the facility.  Additionally, they have been working closely with Simmens and our start-up team ensuring that the plant will be commissioned successfully on natural gas.  Gas commissioning started on August 5th, and to date we have had a successful run with one unit.  Thus the momentum has been building very quickly for the local staff to assume full operations sometime within the next 30 days.  EEOS will keep a small crew involved over the next six months, keeping a watchful eye on operations to make sure that things keep rolling along smoothly.

Enron Industrial Markets
The Forest Products Origination Group headed by Rob Saltiel develops transactions for forest products companies that can benefit from EIM's risk management and structured finance capabilities.  The goal is to advance Enron's desired physical and financial commodity positions in newsprint, pulp, recycled papers, linerboard and/or lumber while bringing commodity and capital benefits to customers.

Given the difficulties currently facing the industry, many companies are particularly interested in managing their earnings and balance sheets more tightly.  As a result, the originators are gaining access to industry CEOs and CFOs to develop their deal concepts.   Current deals under development include asset monetizations, supply/inventory outsourcing, pre-payments for physical supplies, and sculpted swaps.      


IN THE NEWS
HOUSTON (AP) - After a shakeup of its upper management ranks earlier this month, energy giant Enron Corp. solidified its leadership Tuesday by promoting two longtime executives. 
Greg Whalley was named president and chief operating officer while Mark Frevert was elevated to vice chairman. Both will join Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman of the board and chief executive, in the Office of the Chairman.
""Greg and Mark bring a wealth of talent and experience to the Office of the Chairman,"" Lay said. ""In addition to having led Enron Wholesale Services, they have a collective 26 years of extensive experience across Enron's businesses and both played key roles in increasing our deliveries of energy and other commodities in North America and Europe.""

Enron Wholesale Services Best Practice Tips
Skytel is Enron's Preferred Vendor for Paging Devices
Included in the Skytel agreement are numeric/alphanumeric pagers, advanced messaging service devices, and encrypted remote e-mail services via Blackberry? enabled devices.  Enron also receives special discount incentives through year-end 2001, such as 50% discount on Blackberry?-enabled hardware purchases and trade-in allowances on select Research in Motion (RIM) units.  Note:  Employees presently using both pagers and cell phones are encouraged to consolidate to one device by eliminating pagers and utilizing cell phones only.  Negotiations are currently underway to determine the preferred cell phone provider for Enron.  


Got a Great Idea for the EnTouch?   Do you have great news you want everyone in EWS to know about? Something interesting going on in power and gas markets? Or in industrial or global markets?  Send your ideas to Kathie Grabstald via email or call x 3-9610.

Subject:	Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

"Enron Center South Occupancy","This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Office of the Chairman
