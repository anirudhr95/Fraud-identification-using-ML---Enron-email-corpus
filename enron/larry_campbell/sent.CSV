"Weekly Activity Report-Roswell Area","The biennial hazardous waste reporting for 1999 for Transwestern Pipeline 
Company was submitted to the states of Texas, and New Mexico.

A meeting was held in Roswell to discuss air permitting activites and the 
recent agency inspection of the TW Atoka No. 3 C/S.  Due to the agenciy's 
portable testing of units at the AToka No. 2 and 3 C/S, A plan was developed 
to address potential actions which may result from the agency testing.  Also 
discussed was NSPS fuel gas monitoring for nitrogen and sulfur and other 
miscellaneous air issues.  

Texaco has initiated soil excavation of an abondoned pit which may be the 
source of groundwater contamination at the NNG Eunice C/S.  An Enron  
contractor is onsite to oversee the activities by Texaco and to assist in the 
results of the investigation.

The 3rd request to Region VI EPA was completed requesting approval of 5 
Transwestern and 1 NNG facilities for custom fuel monitoring schedules.  
Initial requests dating back to 10/8/98 were included with the packet.  A 
phone call to the Regional Administer of Region VI was also completed.  
Pending additional lack of response,   a meeting will be requested to the 
agency requesting action and approval of the requests.

Data requests from Argent Consulting have been distributed to the field for 
the 1999 emissions inventories.

Results of the additional archeological and biological survey's for the 
Gallup C/S power transmission line 7C application have been submitted to 
regualtory affairs in Omaha.  There were no positive concerns or impacts 
identified which would require additoinal actions.

"RE: Review Draft - Sundevil Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report","Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way, which 
we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of 
I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on 
the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east 
side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking 
into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed 
construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the 
potential of becoming an ""opportunity"" in the event we are forced to deal 
with them.  I appreciate your wirk in this......

Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
Thanks,  Scott

"NNG Gomez Remediation","George, Ive read through your stuff on the Gomez remediation and need some 
help.  Why are we collecting so much groundwater.  Im concerned that charges 
for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive, even though the 
costs are reasonable.  Are we trying to dewater or what?  Other than that, I 
dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should 
get busy on the well installations.  Do you think this will do it with 
respect to no more wells needed.  Id like to get to that position as quickly 
as possible.

"latest on the Az Mainline Expansion","John, Bill this is the latest on the environmental issues for the turbines in 
Arizona.  The arch surveys at stations 3 and 4 on the Navajo reservation have 
been completed and nothing reportable was found or identified.  Each 
contractor is now preparing their reports and hopefully, will have them 
submitted to their mgt. for review in a couple of days and then issued to 
TW.  

The Forest Service has given us permission to do the arch survey for station 
2 on Monday.  The arch survey for station 1 is scheduled for Tuesday.   
Preliminary quotes for the surveys are $4-5000.00 for both sites.  The 
original word from them was 7-10 prior to giving approval.   This was 
definatley a plus.

Still no word on where the turbine buildings are to be located and what 
turbine equipment is to be installed at each facility.  GE or Rolls Royce.  
Additionally, confirmed decisions have not been made as to what auxillary 
power will be installed at each location (wind, natural gas, diesel).

"ADEQ Requirement for Notification of Mechanical Activities","I received a call from a permit engineer with the Arizona Dept. of 
Environmental Quality (ADEQ) concerning the issue of notification of 
mechanical activities at C/S 2  Flagstaff and a mandatory 7 day wating period 
for agency review and approval.   Due to the urgency of the C/S 2 work being 
performed, I had written a notification to the agency friday evening 
requesting approval to initiate the activities detailed in the scope of work 
which was included with the letter.  On Monday, the engineer called and said 
that he had read the letter and had no problems with the activity proceeding 
at the C/S.  After we had discussed this issue at some length, I posed the 
question to him of whether it was necessary to notify the agency of 
mechanical and maintenace activities which  will not impact or change a 
combustion units throughput, fuel use, emissions, horsepower, or cause a 
change in design.  After some discussions I informed him that Transwestern 
will probably inundate the agency with notification letters, he stated that 
as long as the engines operating parameters would not change, ( horsepower, 
emissions, throughput, fuel use etc), and the burden of responsibility will 
rest on Transwestern to ensure that no permit conditions are violated, he 
stated that we may proceed with these types of activities in Arizona without 
any notification to the agency.   

The only hitch being, that when Transwestern does a major mechanical 
activity, which would cost more than  25-30% of the cost of replacing a unit, 
that we provide them a courtesy notification.  I told them we would apprise 
them of such an activity.....

exchange which occurred in 1996.  A history was given of the incidents which 
led up to the NOV being issued and results of the meeting which Transwestern

been resolved.  

The calendar year 2000 PCB annual document logs were prepared and submitted 
to each generator of PCBs on the Transwestern system.

Training was given to the Midland Region over the correct completion and 
submittal of forms used to report natural gas releases  to the TNRCC.  The 
agency has updated and has become more stringent with respect to Regional 
requirements for the reportable releases which are submitted to them.  An 
incomplete form submittal by a compressor station facility near MIdland led 
to this emergency training being given.  Based upon a phone call with Region 
7 of the TNRCC, the agency stated that they will be issuing NOV's to 
facilities that submit incomplete ""Upset/Maintenance NOtification Forms for 
Reportable Events"".

"Tree Removal, Sta. 2","I spoke with Ken Jacobs, with the Forest Service in Flagstaff, concerning his 
agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.  As a condition 
of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine 
trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for 
identification.  After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him 
so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest 
Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges 
will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.  The charges will 
depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the 
trees which are flagged.

As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits 
and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged 
and I will contact Ken Jacobs so that he can make a site visit.

Hi Larry:
 Sorry for the delayed response. I have just got back from an
overseas trip yesterday. I am in the process of preparing a progress report
for you. We have obtained some additional interesting results. I was also
waiting for input from your group. You may recall that at the end of our
Houston meeting, John told me that he would be getting back to me on some
specific directions from the group. I believe that we would be done with the
major aspects of PCB work soon, then we would be focusing on arsenic. Please
let me know of any thoughts and ideas. Thanks Larry.
  We are finally seeing the Spring here and maybe a short one for that
matter. Summer is just around the corner.
Best Regards,
Michael

"Air Permit Delay, Red Rock Expansion","Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 
and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status 
of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.

"RE: Flagstaff Trip Rescheduled for July 24 - 26th","John some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with PG&E:

1. Status of the mini filter separator installations at PG&E 
interconnect/delivery/receipt points?  Future thoughts/plans for additional 
separator installations.

2. PG&E customer attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their 
equipment.  Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs?

3. Internal sampling activities.  How far have PCB's spread into the PG&E 
system.  (wipe tests results versus liquids collections). A map would be 
nice   depicting this.

4. Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry 
on the Topock lateral.  Maybe we should have a little presentation showing  
liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral.  Our 
commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible. 

5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study 
with Penn State and what our  future plans are.  Another Tranwestern effort 
to  show our commitment.

John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been  made to 
decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters.  
If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line 
out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems.  Id like to 
discuss possibly not using  Vector for this type of routene activity any 
longer.  There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do 
the job.  As you know, this decon work is not rocket science and Vector is 
$$$$$$$, although they do a good job. 

Chew on these and if I think of any other additional topics, Ill send them 
your way.....By the way, Earl Chanley is now in Roswell.  FYI in case you 
plan on asking him to attend the meeting........

"Potential NOV letter from TNRCC to EOTT for Ozona Crude Station","I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to 
submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency 
originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the 
TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the 
emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are 
the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 
inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 
tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would 
submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The 
only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an 
increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this 
facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from 
the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that 
the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I 
have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed 
for this facility in the near future.  

In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if 
there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit 
on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with 
previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that 
this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 
(emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed 
from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating 
throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make 
written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list.

Gentlemen:

We should be concluding discssions today with regard to the contracting and
scope of work issues for our project with Penn State.  A number of data
needs have been identified.  Please review available information for the
following:

Larry - Information related to arsenic - analytical/source informaition.
Last three months of analytical on liquids from the pipeline.  We probably
ought to pull together the liquids information from late 1998 to present.
Sampling and lab protocols.  Any Liquids composition analysis.

Earl - Station Three and Four Schematics, Alignment sheets (focus on Section
4 so we do not overwhelm the Professor's team). Gas composition analysis
(primarily Needles).

Eric - please forward this to Ben Asante, Terry Gallassini, Frank Osborne
and cc: Mike Nelson and Rich Jolly.  Remind me to contact Neta on billing
information/format to send to the Professor's team .

Ben and Terry -  what modeling information/software can we share with Penn
State??

Frank - Mike left you a message about contacting the Professor's team on the
method by which we can transfer materials electronically rather than killing
an entire forest for the paper copies.  This is an enginerring facility so
they likely have similar capablities to us.

We will follow up when we return.

Subject:  Mewborne - Quercho Bone Springs Unit - Sec 23-18S-32E

Wade - As you're probably aware of by now, on April 2nd, Carl Eby with
Phillips called inquiring about a possible tie-in of the subject unit to
our ""Young Deep"" pipeline system we acquired from Koch.  A question arose
as to whether or not a west to east spur existed off the north/south
mainline which would be near the unit.  It was initially conveyed to me
that ETS would take a backhoe out to the mainline to make this
determination.  I have since learned that this has been delayed due to the
need for an ""environmental matrix"", whatever that may be.  The roads to
this unit are in extremely poor condition, and the operator would like to
pipeline connect if possible.  Production is represented at 300 bpd.

A couple of issues:

1)  Could someone explain to me the process involved in an ""env. matrix"",
and why it take 2 months to determine if we have a pipeline in the ground?
Is someone with ETS in Houston delaying this, if so, who is the responsible
party?
2)  Tariff on this system (NMSCC #17) is 50 cents/bbl at this time, plus
PLA.  From the maps I have, it appears this system consists of around 10 to
12 miles of gathering and mainline.  Current production on the system is
around 115 bpd of WTI, or $23,000/yr monetized.  The pipe in the ground is
fairly new from what I've been told by my contact at Koch.  If we can
manage to tie this well in, revenue would be raised an additional
$60,000/year at current tariff rates.  What costs are currently associated
with this system?  A decision needs to be made on the economic feasibility
of keeping it operable given the current tariff rates and current/proposed
throughput, or the rates needed to keep the system viable.

Bottom line, Phillips and the producer need an answer, one way or the
other, so they can get on with the business of safely transporting this
crude oil.  EOTT Pipeline needs an answer, one way or the other, so we can
decide how to best manage this system.

Any assistance in moving this forward and allowing EOTT to maintain some
image of credibility would be appreciated.  I would also like to pass along
my appreciation of Rick Cribbs and the information he has been able to
provide thusfar.

Thanks for the update.

I can indeed confirm that we have the 2081 in place.  (But, to be precise, it 
was not ARCO Energy's 2081; it was a 2081 that was issued in the first 
instance to Koch that was assigned to us.  So, make sure the 2081 you are 
working off of is the Memorandum of Understanding between fish and game and 
Koch, and not a permit issued to Arco.)

Also, according to Kenny M, West Coast Environ is working on some other 
permit for the 6-inch line (I don't recall exactly what it is, but Kenny can 
tell you.  Unfortunately, the handoff from Gary to you folks seems to have 
left us in a bit of disarray, so it'll all have to be tracked down this 
way.)  Pehaps you can crack the whip on West Coast re this also?  Thanks.

With respect to the environmental clearances and permits for the Rogas 
project, here is where we presently stand.

2081 State Fish and Game Permit.  According to the North Coles facility, Ed 
Attanasio has a letter from Koch authorizing transfer of the ARCO Energy 2081 
permit to EOTT.

10A1B Federal US Fish and Wildlife Permit for EOTT.  I have checked on the 
status of this permit  which will be issued to EOTT by  the USFWS and am in 
the process of trying to push it along.  The wheels of govt. sometime move 
pretty slow.  We are waiting for written approval from USFWS to the Kern 
Water Bank approving of EOTT using the KWB 10A1B permit  use for the Rogas 
project only.  this letter is expected by the end of next week.   I will keep 
everyone updated.   

The biologist is ready and waiting for a start date to begin her surveys and 
has stated that the cold temperatures may cause her to delay her sampling and 
survey work as mandated by the Department of Fish and Game.  

The issue of the water by pass channel crossing is still in progress.  We 
will need approval under 404 Nationwide Permit, 1603 streambed alteration 
notification approval and State Reg Board Authorization.  I have contacted 
the consultant Gary has been using for assistance with these applications and 
they are sending  applications to my attention.  The signed and completed 
packets  will be going out fed-x tomorrow.  I would expect a 30 day waiting 
period before these documents are signed by the agencies, however, because 
these approvals apply only to the by pass channel feature, this should not 
delay initial construction of the project .

I have prepared the stormwater permit application for construction activities 
which are required for construction activities greater than 5 acres.

1) We have the permit and drawing for boring the Kern County Water Agencies
Cross Valley Canal. I will also contact Helt Engineering for the canal
profile and Soils Engineering for the soil analysis.

2) Permits for Hwy 43 and Interstate 5 are state Permits through Caltrans,
at this time we have not received the permits. Helt Engineering has
repeatedly made calls but are having difficulty getting anyone to answer
the phone. I have asked them to notify Caltrans of who is the contractor
for the project. Alan if you can provide me with the name of the boring
contractor I will provide that information at the same time. If I do not
have an answer soon I will make a trip to Fresno and see what I can find
out. Matt, Floyd Little is the contact for Caltrans, you probably remember
the problems you had when you tried to contact him.

3) Gary Fuller put West Coast Environmental in charge of obtaining a permit
for crossing the Kern River By-Pass channel from the Army Corp of
Engineers. As we discussed last week the application for the permit had not
been filed. Larry Campell with the environmental department has been asked
to contact West Coast Environmental for the status of the permit
application. I will provide the drawing, permit and permit requirements
when we receive them.

4) I will gather copies of the conditions and requirements from the water
districts and provide that to Alan.

5) We have not received the Fish and Games approval at this time. When we
receive it and have final approval from our environmental and legal
departments I will provide the Permit to Alan.

As you know we are at the States mercy on obtaining these permits. We are
shooting for the two week starting date as mention earlier. I will keep you
informed.

Matt,

In order for Ken Small Construction to plan and schedule the work in the
most economic manner we would like the following information in hand prior
to starting field construction work.

1) Copy of permit from Kern County Water Agency for the Cross Valley Canal
with the drawing that was submitted for permit application.

2) Copy of permit from Kern County for the Enos Lane crossing with drawing
that was submitted for permit application, also I need to get KSCI listed
as
contractor on permit.

3) Copy of permit from Caltrans for the I-5 crossing with drawing that was
submitted for permit application, also I need to get KSCI listed as rider
along with bore contractor.

4) Copy of permit from Army Corps of Engineers for the Kern River crossing
with drawing that was submitted for permit application, along with any
conditions required.

5) Copy of Fish & Game, Kern Water Bank Authority, Buena Vista Water
Storage
and West Kern Water requirements or conditions for construction of the
pipelines.

Your help in letting KSCI know the status of the above permits as soon as
possible will also help to set up a workable schedule that we can utilize
for our construction purposes.

"Conference Cal with Adewumi","This is just a short update on the conference call just completed with 
Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project 
proposed for the Transwestern mainline system.  David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi 
and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon 
his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the 
model will yeild some useful information.  Adewumi was asked about the 
simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can 
address this situation.  He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline 
segement  selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information 
could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and 
elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected.  As is the 
case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be 
addressed until we begin the process. 

It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact 
Michael Adewumi.  David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and 
operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input.  It may also be in 
the best interest of this project  to see a team of technical and operational 
experts from Enron and Transwestern begin a  brain stroming of this project 
during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning 
trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping.  By working through 
the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns  and 
increase the cleaning success.  Although Transwestern has been involved in 
this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data 
results, the system has met with variable success.  The more technical and 
operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be 
the modeling conclusions and results of the  cleaning activity.

inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna 
environmental person was present.  She had been asked to be there by the 
EPA.  During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or 
decision had been made by Enron management towards remediation assistance in 
the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.  I had informed her that we were 
still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future 
concerning management's decision.  I would appreciate it very much if each of 
you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done 
and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a 
proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure.

Subject: Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

"Public Water System Sampling Time Again","Sta.3, 4 and 5

As you may know, we are at the end of our grace period for not being required 
to do monthly sampling for the public water systems at sta. 3,4 and 5.  Jeff 
Lobstein has been requested to do the monthly drinking water sample 
collections at  each of the three compressor station and has three months 
completed.  This memo is a reminder that each location is again required to 
send their drinking water analytical reports to the following agencies on a 
monthly basis as the analytical results are received at each compressor 
station.     

Stations 3 and 4:   each months reports are to be sent to the following 2 
agencies:

 Navajo Nation EPA
 P.O. Box 339
 Window Rock, AZ 86515

 Atten: Yolanda Barney   Program Manager


 US EPA    Region IX
 75 Hawthorne Street
 San Francisco, CA 94105

 Atten: Danny Collier (WTR-6)


Station 5:    your water sample reports are to be sent to the Navajo Nation 
EPA in Window Rock, AZ, only.  In speaking with Charlie, he has indicated 
that he will be handling  the reporting for Station 4 also.

I have contacted Nortest in Flagstaff (520) 774-2312, which is the lab 
selected to do the testing to send station 3 reports to station 3 and station 
4 and 5 reports to station 5.

The Navajo Nation has been given primacy and will be taking over the drinking 
water program for the Navajo Nation in November of this year.  Expect some 
changes in reporting.   Youmay want  to use MCS as a monthly reminder for the 
submittal of the reports.  Questions, give me a call  505 625-8022..

"Re: Arizona Permitting","Ruth, I spoke to the ADEQ about the accelerated permit program and apparently 
there are some internal problems with this program and the third party 
contractors which are on their ""list"".  At this stage of the game, they 
recommended that we do not resort to this alternative as most of the work 
that the contractor would do has been done by the ADEQ allready.  I then 
indicated that I would be contacting the Director of the ADEQ about the 
urgency of this multi million dollar project and the benefits to the state of 
Arizona.  The permit engineer thought that would be a good idea. Because we 
will be permitting through this agency again for Sundevil, and dont want to 
upset the agency cart, I am going to speak with the permit engineers 
supervisor and then to the Director of the ADEQ next week about either an 
accelerated issuance of the permit or more realistically, allowance to do 
some construction activities while the ADEQ is completing the review and 
permit writing.  This way, I wont step on any toes.  By the way, the ADEQ 
said that they dont consider this to be a PSD issue.  The following time line 
for permit issuance under the Arizona laws at this stage appears to be: 
another 2-3 weeks to write the permit, one month by the ADEQ technical staff 
to do the required internal review and then the  EPA is given a one month 
period to do their review, which is requried by the EPA for all class 1 
permit applications in Arizona.  Because Im going to be in Phoenix next week, 
I might be able to set a meeting up with the ADEQ Director and plead 
Transwestern's case.  Ill let you know how it goes......

"RE: Flagstaff Trip Rescheduled for July 24 - 26th","John, I was just thinking that if this deconning becomes a routene activity 
for us and PG&E, we might want to consider breaking  in a company that is 
less expensive, can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work 
product.  Vector, has to travel  from Ohio.   Deconning the separators 
becomes an internal  washing job of the vessel.  

I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else.  Tiny, do 
you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PG&E?  
As you know, they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA, but with the 
new PCB rules in place, a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning 
activities.  How do you think PG&E will respond to us possibly using another 
contractor other than Vector for the work.  I suppose we can bring this issue 
up in Flagstaff.

Mums the word on the PCB modeling issue, John.  Thanks for your guidance and 
thoughts.

Subject: RE: Flagstaff Trip Rescheduled for July 24 - 26th

Larry,
Good thoughts.  I believe Rod Boschee told me he was putting the same 
thoughts on the agenda which cover your items 1-4.  However, I will take a 
close look at his draft agenda and make certain that the equivalent thoughts 
are on there.  Now, about item 5 and your closing paragraph.   Item No. 5 - I 
do not want to open the issue of the ""PCB Model"" to PG&E at this time.  Maybe 
later, but not now.  As far as your thoughts in the closing paragraph - Randy 
Rice and I want the Ultimate Separators ""deconned"".  We took great pains last 
fall (when we had the separators down) to test and decon them - so we could 
establish a ""base line"".  Why would we take the system down and change the 
filters out and test any residue without also deconning the facility?  If we 
did that - then hypothetically - next fall (2002) when we took the system 
down and changed the filters - if we took any wipe samples - it could contain 
residue accumulated over a two year period and not just during the past 
twelve months.  It seems to me that it makes much more sense to decon the 
separators at the same time that we change the filters and that way we will 
know exactly what has hit them sense the last time we opened them up.  I'm 
open to further argument on it - but that is the way Randy and I see it at 
this point in time.  

On the subject of the selection of the contractor - Randy and I believe that 
you and Tiny should probably select whatever consulting firm can do the best 
job and is most dependable.  Remember that PG&E had confidence in Vector (at 
least that is what I recall from last fall).  So, if we go with a new 
consultant - will PG&E have the same confidence?  Also, you and Tiny must 
make certain that the firm we use has some ""acceptable"" credentials.  What 
PCB issues have they handled in the past, etc.  

I will be glad to discuss any of this with you or Tiny as needed.

Thanks, John Shafer

Subject: RE: Flagstaff Trip Rescheduled for July 24 - 26th

John some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with PG&E:

1. Status of the mini filter separator installations at PG&E 
interconnect/delivery/receipt points?  Future thoughts/plans for additional 
separator installations.

2. PG&E customer attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their 
equipment.  Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs?

3. Internal sampling activities.  How far have PCB's spread into the PG&E 
system.  (wipe tests results versus liquids collections). A map would be 
nice   depicting this.

4. Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry 
on the Topock lateral.  Maybe we should have a little presentation showing  
liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral.  Our 
commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible. 

5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study 
with Penn State and what our  future plans are.  Another Tranwestern effort 
to  show our commitment.

John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been  made to 
decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters.  
If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line 
out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems.  Id like to 
discuss possibly not using  Vector for this type of routene activity any 
longer.  There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do 
the job.  As you know, this decon work is not rocket science and Vector is 
$$$$$$$, although they do a good job. 

Chew on these and if I think of any other additional topics, Ill send them 
your way.....By the way, Earl Chanley is now in Roswell.  FYI in case you 
plan on asking him to attend the meeting........

Glad you got this audit out of the way.  I will be needing your agenda items 
for our meeting with PG&E so we can send them to Rod Boschee.  Think it over 
carefully, and let's have all of the items we need to discuss ready to go

"Weekly Activity Report, Roswell Area","Began initial field confirmation of EOTT crude oil tanks and equipment in the 
MIdland Region.  Five of the thirteen teams which have EOTT facilites have 
been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet.

A meeting was held with the Midland field teams which have Title V 
facilities, to complete and submit the required annual certifications.  All 
Title V locations in the MIdland region were in compliance for this year.

Region IX EPA has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air 
permits for the Redrock turbine installation, Transwestern is to conduct an 
endangered species survey of C/S's 3 and 4.  A contractor has been contacted 
and the surveys will be completed prior to September 15th.   This is not a 
new issue, as EPA Region VI, Dallas required consideration of the Endangered 
Species Act to be completed at the Luguna C/S, which is on Laguna Indian 
Lands.  The Title V permit will not be issued for the Laguna C/S until the 
EPA is satisified that endangered species are not a concern.  

Preliminary environmental and right of way field data are being provided to 
an environmental contractor to initiate a fatal flaw analysis of a proposed 
project for Transwestern Pipeline Company.

Continued EOTT crude oil release data collections for forthcoming Sept. 27th 
NFL meeting in MIdland.

Larry,
I contacted Norm Moreno at the POEP this afternoon. He said that he would 
contact Ed Steadman, Associate Director at the EERC, and pass along my name 
and number so that Ed could contact me. Norm said that he would prefer to do 
it this way rather than to have us initiate the first contact. The other day 
I found the web site for the research center (www.eerc.und.nodak.edu).

$120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating

The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air 
permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns 
brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email 
was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added 
to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the 
draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for 
Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from 
the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of 
this week. 

Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.

"FYI, PCB mtg with SoCal","The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held 
this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management 
and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 
(86%).  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses 
for PCB activities in California.  On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph 
Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their 
system and are presented below:

SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on 
portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.  It is these 
portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to 
declassify.  These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal 
system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the 
fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor 
stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot 
California.  Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, 
it appears  the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline 
areas.    

SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss 
the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides 
natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.  The location 
of this  interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca.

Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 
interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.  As you know, Transwetern 
supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 
2 separators will be approx. $33,000 plus installation charges.  Ralph stated 
that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002.  Of 
note, Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side 
of the interconnect which means that maintenance and operation of each 
separator will be SoCal's responsiblility.  these charges will be passed on 
to Transwestern at 86%.

"Koch South Texas pipeline data room questions and answers","Randy, based upon the records review, this is the only issue that may be a 
problem.  If a tank has been moved to another location, it would trigger 
requirements which were enacted on the date of the relocation.  For instance, 
if a tank constructed prior to 1973 was moved in 1978, there would be 
emissions control requirements placed on the tank as required by the 1978 
tank regulations.  If the tank had remained at its original location, it 
would be grandfathered with respect to emissions.  However, because the tank 
was relocated, it is looked upon as being a tank constructed in 1978 and 
subject to the 1978 regulations and is no longer grandfathered.

I was not given this information during the records review, so I dont know if 
any of the tanks apply.  If any of the tanks fit into the above scenerio, 
EOTT or Koch will be  looking at some major $$$$$ to bring any subject tank 
into compliance.  Generally speaking, the regualtions and costs to comply 
increase as a function of date.    


1. Q. Of the tanks listed on the spreadsheet, have any of the tanks been 
relocated from its original construction locations?  List the tank, date 
moved and   location moved to.
A.  Benevides Station Tank 6125 and Mirando Station Tank 28591 were relocated 
to those stations.  Three Rivers Tanks 28508 and 28100 were   relocated and 
re-erected at that station.  Duval Station Tank 28052 and Mirando Station 
28045 were relocated and re-erected at those stations prior  to Koch,s 
acquisition of those assets.

Subject: ADEQ permits: public hearing


As Larry has probably reported to you by now, the public hearing last night 
in Williams was accomplished with a satisfactory result. Shudeish had copies 
of the draft permits, which Larry reviewed and found satisfactory. 
Apparently, about three weeks ago, Prabhat Bargava left his DEQ position as 
Section Manager, Compliance, to take a position with a consultant, CH2M Hill, 
which is trying to start an air group in Arizona.
I just spoke with Shudeish about how soon the actual permits will be issued. 
He said that DEQ had to wait a few days after the November 23 close of the 
comment period (this was announced at the hearing) to allow mailed comments 
postmarked on Friday, Nov 23 to reach DEQ. He then said that he expected both 
permits would be issued middle to end of next week (by Nov. 30): he said he 
had to blend the EPA issues into the permits, but that was not problemmatic. 
Larry talked with Shudeish last night about the EPA issues, and that did not 
seem to be any difficulty.
I then asked Shudeish why the comment period was extended until Nov 23 when 
the rule states that the comment period is only 30 days long and the comment 
period opened by first publication on October 17. The public hearing also 
must be no sooner than 30 days after first publication, and that is why it 
was set for Nov. 19. Thus, even allowing for a couple of days after what 
should have been the close of comment period (Nov 19, because Nov 17 was a 
Saturday), the permits should be issued by the first of next week rather than 
the end of the week. Shudeish said he would check and get back to me.
I know this is only a couple of days difference (assuming the permits are 
issued by Nov 30), but I am sensitive to Jerry's urgency to get moving 
quickly, and I also want to lay some groundwork to object if actual issuance 
starts dragging.
Please let me know if you have any thoughts or comments.

Subject: TNC Membership

On a conference call on Wednesday concerning the ETS/TNC partnership, John 
Shafer was concerned about the numbers of ETS employees signing up for the 
free membership program.  John ask that I contact each of the DES's and 
coordinate with them the contact of members of all ETS teams to encourage 
them to take advantage of the free membership.  The thought is once the team 
members receive the material concerning The Nature Conservancy (TNC) they 
might as individuals or as teams be encourage to participate actively in the 
programs.

Phil Lowry endorses the program and has agreed for ETS to pay the first years 
membership.  It would probably be correct to contact your Regional Directors 
and Advisors prior to contacting the teams.  John Shafer would like to see 
100 % participation in the program.

I understand we all have busy schedules, so if you don't have time, I would 
be happy to make the contact for you.  John asked that I track these numbers 
for reporting to him on our next conference call (probably in September).  
Could I get the team names and the number of employees that have elected to 
participate.

In advance thank you for your time and effort in this matter.  Again I would 
be happy to make the contacts for you.

Subject: Re: Hendrick Wink Tank Farm  

I didn't forget about you.  I was trying to verify which facility you were 
asking about since there are several Hendrick and Wink facilities on my file 
list.  I was able to verify that an EOTT ""PLP"" check in the amount of $416.00 
was cut on 10/29/99 to pay the FY 2000 Emissions Fee (9/1/99 - 8/31/00) for 
Hendrick/Wink Station (TNRCC Account # WM01910).  However, there is no 
evidence of payment for FY 2001.  I believe, though, that Craig Willoughby of 
ENTRIX did some work on emissions for at least one of the Hendrick facilities 
while he was working for EOTT last year.  I left a message for him a couple 
of days ago but haven't heard from him yet.  I think that whatever he put 
together is in the ETS file.  I've left a message for Kerry Fields to check 
the ETS files for information.  Bottom line:  Looks like the invoice you have 
does need to be paid, but which company is responsible for this fee?

P.S. Would you like a copy of what I found?

"Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6","John, Lou, Cutty, Bill, I want to bring this issue back up for your 
attention, as I know that everyone is very busy.  During the EPA Title V 
inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna 
environmental person was present.  She had been asked to be there by the 
EPA.  During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or 
decision had been made by Enron management towards remediation assistance in 
the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.  I had informed her that we were 
still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future 
concerning management's decision.  I would appreciate it very much if each of 
you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done 
and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a 
proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure.

Subject: Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

"Weekly Activity Report","Presented Title V training to the Flagstaff Team.  The training included 
responsibilities, recordkeeping and semi annual reporting requirements.

A meeting was held with representatives of Transwestern and PG&E to discuss 
activities related to removing PCB's from the Topock Lateral.  Sampling data 
was reviewed and discussions were held addressing past cleaning efforts.  
PG&E has stated by letter and verbally that natural gas volumes will be 
decreased weekly until PCB concentrations fall below 5 ppm.  Transwestern 
will be implementing a pipeline cleaning of the remaining 1850 of pipe 
between our M/S and the PG&E C/S.  Included in this cleaning will be 
decontamination of the additional filter separators and meter runs.

Assisted in the compilation and data gathering of the Title V compliance 
monitoring and annual certification reports for C/S No. 5, Thoreau.

The annual blanket request for the Arizona SHPO was submtted for renewal.

Notification letters were submitted to the state of New Mexico notifiying the 
agency of like for like replacements of recipricating engines at the AToka 
No. 1 C/S.  Additional notifications were submitted to the agency apprising 
them of engine removal activities at C/S's No. 5 and 9 which would impact 
emissions fees.

appointment with Michael Adewuni at Penn State for 9 am on Tuesday October 26 
for the purpose of reviewing his pipeline flow model and potential 
application to predicting PCB movement and collection points in pipelines.  
He has performed previous research studies utilizing various hydrocarbon 
solvents , including  terpinol.  

Dr. Adewuni has requested that we provide to him before the meeting the 
following information:

Drawings of the particular section of pipe and the configuration;
The general volumes of condensate passing through the pipeline;
The natural gas flow rate and variables
General PCB concentrations found in the section.

Please respond and let me know who will take the responsibility for selecting 
the section of pipe and providing the requested information?

Dr. Adewuni 's email address at Penn State is ----    michael@pnge.psu.edu

Please also provide a duplicate information package to me prior to the trip 
for review.



Thanks Mike

"Archeology Survey C/S 3 and 4","I was just informed by the Navajo Nation that prior to receiving approval 
from the agency fo rthe installation of the turbines, an archeology survey is 
to be performed at each compressor station site.  Be advised that an 
archeologist will be present at sta. 3 on 3/ 9 this friday in the am and at 
sta. 4 on 3/12 monday also in the am to conduct the required surveys.  Please 
have someone from each team present at each location during the surveys and 
allow access to the facility by the archeologist.  The survey should only 
last 3-4 hours.  

Donna, I spoke to the Navajo Nation about expiditing the report submittal 
once the archeological surveys have been completed and the Nation  said that 
under their current regulations, assuming that there are no cultural 
resources identified at either location, they are allowed 30 days to review 
the findings before they are required to issue the final report.  She didnt 
think it would take this long, but said that due to existing surveys back 
logs, and personnel, it might.  Ill keep the pressure on.

The Navajo Nation F&W has not returned my call about what they might 
require.  Birds of a feather...  Ill be persistent here also.......and let 
you know when I find out something..........

person conducting the inspection will be arriving onsite at 11:00 am.  I am

 emissions fees paid for the last 3 years

 emissions inventories submitted for the last 3 years 

 1999 natural gas throughput

 inlet gas analysis for 1999

 H2S analysis for 1999


Also have the facility's air permit history for as far back as you can go.  
If your records have been entered into envisions, spend some time getting 
familiar with the data retrival and look like you know what you're doing on 
the 30th.

If requested, I can drive over on the 29th and assist you guys in getting

"Fuel Consumption, La Plata A","Guys, I received Harrell's memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and 
the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the 
permits fuel use requirements.  My question is, how does the fuel use compare 
with what Solar says the fuel use should be?  If we can get Solar to provide 
written guarantees and ""UP"" the fuel use value for the turbine, we can up the 
fuel value on the permit.  The state of Colorado perceives increased fuel use 
beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in 
need of mechanical adjustment.  From their eyes, this would be a strong 
indication of excess emissions, and I think there evaluation would hold some 
merit.  Anyway, I dont want to send up a red flag to the state of Colorado.  

Would you contact Solar and compare their fuel use values with what the 
monitors say the turbine is burning at La Plata? 

Then let me know.  If worse gets to worse, I may be able to use another 
tactic, but only as a last resort.

"RE: TW Expansion Project","Bill,  the baseline noise surveys, which have been completed, were performed 
by Hoover and Keith out of Houston, Tx.  I have a meeting scheduled with the 
permit engineers from state of Arizona on Monday to discuss the permitting 
for the two C/S on state lands.  Ive dealt with these individuals before, but 
the ADEQ has gone through some reg changes and I want to visit with them on 
that.  After that meeting, I will decide who should do the applications.  I 
have  calls in to the person I deal with in the EPA in San Francisco for the 
two locations on the Navajo lands.  Pending the outcome of each  meeting, I 
will decide who to use.  Ive used Argent in the past for both Arizona permits 
and Indian lands permits, and they would probably be my first choice.    

I am keeping Mr. Ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or 
activities that impact the permits for Arizona.  One thing that I shold 
mention is that I spoke with Phil Lowery about his desires for this project.  
He has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations 
for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in 
the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential 
kinks.  Based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline 
units, which will be permitted for a six month period, there will still be an 
overall  major emissions decrease.  After the six month period, the existing 
units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again.    Also, my 
intent is to permit these turbines at 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the lower 25 
ppm NOx number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on 
the Northern Border system.  If this was a new station, I probably wouldnt be 
allowed to use the 45 number, but seeing as how there will be a major 
decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine, 
this should be easy to do.  The differrence in emission between 45 and 25 is 
not that great and it will allow the facilities in Az a larger range of 
operation comfort as opposed to the 25 ppm number that Rolls says they can 
do, but has had trouble reaching.  One thing that has complicated the 
permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations.  By 
permitting at 45 ppm, this will greatly help this.     Ill share the 
emissions numbers with you, when I receive them from Rolls and the emissions 
info I have from the existing units. 

I have spoken to Terry Hacket about doing the F-1 document for the FERC 
submittal, and have been feeding him data and supporting information for the 
report.  Based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation, the F-1 
report will be completed by March 1.    

Is there something Ive missed?

Approval has been given to proceed with preliminary activities to accomplish 
an expansion on the TW System on a ""Fast Track"".  The option which has been 
approved is Option #1 (38,000 hp turbine at Stations 1, 2 3 and 4.)  At this 
time you should prepare a Work Order authorization for $350,000 to capture 
those preliminary cost.  I assume that negotiations with a compressor 
manufacturer will result  in a requirement to commit to an order within the 
next 60 days.  Before a final order (with a cancellation schedule) can be 
executed we will need additional approval authorization.  When you have 
determined the Project Manager for this project please inform all the 
interested individuals.  We look forward to reviewing a project timeline in 
the very near future.

"PCB Study on the SoCal System","I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB engineer with SoCal, about a pipeline 
liquids collection SoCal wants to take at our Needles facility.  Ralph said 
that SoCal will be undertaking a study on their pipeline to determine why the 
concentration and liquids volume of PCB's has reduced into their system in 
the past couple of  years (97-2000). I shared with Ralph and up until this 
year, we have not had liquids at the Needles facility since 1994.  He stated 
that they have seen reduced concentrations and are curious as to why this 
trend is occurring (sounds like good news to me).  He said that their data 
shows the following:

 1998 liquids concentrations  only 1% regulated at the federal level

 1999 liquids concentrations only 8% regulated at the federal level

Ralph has requested that SoCal be allowed to collect a  liquids sample at the 
Needles M/S and I have contacted the Needles team about assisting SoCal with 
the collection.

I would expect that this may have implications with respect to slight 
increased billing for analytical charges that SoCal will be charging us for 
and we reveiw on a quarterly basis with them.

"May PCB Meeting Notes ET&S and PG&E","1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project.

Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on 
schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system.  
PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of 
separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon 
tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not 
create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, 
according to PG&E, are in place.

PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to 
discuss maintenance issues with ET&S.

Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. 
pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or 
disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E 
will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or 
dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has 
indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce 
costs associated with cleaning the pipe.

2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. 

Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at 
MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round 
of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples 
collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to 
be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels 
north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing 
showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has 
been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be 
collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant 
to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is 
considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's.

Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The 
gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas 
Co.  system which is PCB free.

3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. 

West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system 
has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these 
locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to 
have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the 
sampling program.  
Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs 
under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the 
pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the 
bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By 
increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced.

It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the 
separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks.

4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators.

Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter 
separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The 
determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1) 
a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of 
the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm.
Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station) 
have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern 
River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have 
shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this 
location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that 
there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume 
of gas deliveries.

PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional 
filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer 
load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection 
at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express 
additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations.

5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators.

 a. Siting, Design and Engineering

 b. Cost Estimates 

PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus 
an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next 
week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter 
separators may be proposed for installation.  

The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29 
indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have 
not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites 
basis as PG&E presented.

One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions 
of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement 
company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the 
success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the 
cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it 
will be a 2001 project.

6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection.

Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic 
sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to 
the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the 
Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies 
to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will 
coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle.

7. Other Issues or Concerns.

Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January, 
2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to 
Transwestern.  

PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300 
mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S 
configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day.  

8. Next Steps.

The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow 
inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection   
additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location 
of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as 
some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on 
other business.

By the way, I got a call back from Greg Simmons in the BLM State Office in
Arizona - my question to him was whether or not a proposed ROW across the
Agua Fria National Monument would constitute a ""Fatal Flaw.""  He indicated
that it likely would be a fatal flaw.  He said that it would take ""an act of
congress"" literally, not figuratively, to put a pipeline across a National
Monument.  The boundary of the Monument is the east side of I 17, south of
Cordes Junction - I don't know if we can stay on the west side of the
Interstate there, but we might oughta check it out - it looks like we could
get into some pretty rough side-sloping, two-toning.  FYI.

Subject: NYISO Newsflash: External load a good deal



All,
?
You may already be  aware of this, but NYISO staff just revealed in a meeting 
that significant  opportunities exist to purchase in real time from the NYISO 
LBMP market at the  PJM proxy bus (i.e., as an external load), due to the 
impact of ECA 1006B.?  When the tie is import constrained in BME, prices 
there since the 1006 ECAs were  implemented have been as low as -$1000.? In 
this case the BME price would  be used for settlement, and you would be paid 
$1000/MWh to export power there  (as your export would offset inbound 
congestion).
?
As more people begin  to take advantage of this, the BME prices can be 
expected to be less  negative.
?
Caution!? If  you schedule a transaction DA, but it fails the DA checkout, 
when there is  congestion on the ties in BME, you will have to settle the 
difference at the BME  price, and could get hammered.
?
NYISO will probably  issue a bulletin about this later today.
?
Scott

"Weekly Environmental Activity-Roswell Area","The Title V air permit applications for C/S's 3 and 4 were submitted to 
Region IX EPA in San Francisco.  These were the last two applications to be 
filed for the Redrock Mainline Exspansion project in Arizona.

Assistance was given to all field teams in Arizona in the preparation and 
submittal of the required annual complaince certifications required under 
each facilities Title V Operating Permit.

2000 emissions inventories were submitted to the TNRCC for the eleven C/S in 
the Midland Region.

"Status, Redrock Air Permits","Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting 
activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.

Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and 
has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the 
permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e 
mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete, 
but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to 
the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15 
and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ 
plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in 
Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is located approx. 
30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council 
Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no 
responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process, 
they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring 
sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel 
monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them 
otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer 
for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also 
an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions 
from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.

Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for 
the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also 
approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There 
are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment 
period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it 
will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on 
the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this 
date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for 
station 3 and or 4.

Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.

"Staions 3 and 4 air permit comments to EPA","Jon and Ruth, presented below are the comments to the air perimts at 3 and 
4.  Please review for clairty and content.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn about 
all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No. 2.  
He is checking on what the EPA can do about this.  I have spoken to Arnold 
Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement for NOx 
and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by doing some 
major gas recycling.  This is a fuel waste and costly.  Anyway, depending 
upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably 
determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40 ppmvd.  Id 
like your comments asap.


          1.  The responsible official name change to  Danny Pribble.

                         2.. The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 
25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of 
startup   and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these 
rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE   data 
indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load 
conditions of 60%and lower.

 The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of 
the time with reduced load operations (64% load) occurring  no more than 20% 
of the time.  The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in 
the application in units of lb.hr and ton/yr.  These values were accepted by 
the EPA for the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the 
EPA (See EPA Statement  of Basis document).  Because the permit conditions 
hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is   
concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of 
NOx and CO would be 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is  requesting that  a provision 
be made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 
ppmvd during the 20 % of  the time that the turbines operating conditions is 
less than or equal to 60%.

3. The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern 
to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not     normally 
used to monitor and measure sulfur in the natural gas.  Transwestern has 
received approval from the EPA for other custom  fuel monitoring schedules to 
use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the 
proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas.

		 Subject: Additional Soil Investigations, North Coles Levee

After reveiwing the documents entitled, ""Baseline Environmental Investigation 
of Arco North Coles Levee Plant 8, Rogas Loading Facility and Associated 
Natural Gas Pipeline Systems Kern County, California"" and ""Report of 
Preliminary Asessment Sampling North Coles Levee Gas Plant Loading Rack Area 
Tupman, California"", it appears that the following areas should be 
investigated further to detemine horizontal and vertical extent of  
identified contamination from the above referenced reports:

 Tank 15 area-  total petroleum hydrocarbons

 Glycol reboiler area- total petroleum hydrocarbons

 Hot oil heater area- total petroleum hydrocarbons

   Wash rack area- lead

 Propane comp. area lead  
    total petroleum hydrocarbons
    chromates

 Cooling tower area- chromates

 Compressor area- BTEX
    chromates
    lead

In the ""Baseline Environmental Investigation"" report, sampling was only 
conducted to an approximate depth of 2.5'.  I am not comfortable with basing 
decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth, in leau of the 
fact that  many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move 
vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas.  This 
is indeed the case for chromates.  I based my recommendations for metal 
concentrations on the federal RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste target levels 
for metals and evaluated  the TPH and BTEX levels with the  underground 
storage tank guidlines for California.  There were references to a 1989 
document in the ""Baseline"" report for specific parameters, but there may have 
been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and 
therefore, I used 10,000 ppm which is a general action level for most states 
for total petroleum hydrocarbons.  Again, I did not evaluate the mercury or 
the loading rack issues.

One last issue.  As you know, identification of contamination is usually 
accomplished by sight observations of visible contamination, knowledge of 
processes and or history.  Report results of the surface contamination do not 
show there to be an immediate environmental concern.  Due to the age of the 
facility, there may be concerns which were not identified in the reports.  
However, based upon the locations of the preliminary samplings which were 
conducted throughout the facility, it appears that the information presented 
in the reports would be adequate to address suspected contamination at the 
facility.

Subject: NNG Gomez Water Disposal

I began discussions regarding this issue with Sonny, an employee of Cliffwood 
Oil & Gas, operator of the Ft. Stockton Unit Water Station. This is the 
outfit that was taking our recovered groundwater. Sonny discussed this with 
Cliffwoods' reservoir engineers in Houston and they decided they did not want 
to accept this water regardless of permit status due to their concern that 
the relatively fresh water may cause calcium carbonate to precipitate in the 
disposal well perforations and plug up their well. 

Lee Cisneros of 4C Construction, the outfit hauling the recovered water, put 
me in touch with Kenneth McIntyre of Stockton Water Inc. Kenneth informed me 
that they would accept the water if permit condition would allow it. Kenneth 
said they would dispose of the water in one of two wells, their University 
165 or RS Pershing Well#1. 

This afternoon I discussed the issue of disposal of recovered water with 
Doris at the TRC District 8 office. Doris looked up the permit for these two 
wells and informed me that they were permitted for produced water only. After 
further discussion of the situation she transferred my call Mark Henkhaus, 
District 8 Director. Mark said that normally this waste stream would go to an 
""oil and gas waste"" disposal facility as you had pointed out in our meeting 
last week, but suggested an alternative. Mark suggested that I obtain a 
letter of no objection from the operator of the SWD disposal well and 
transmit the letter with a request for approval from his office to dispose of 
the recovered water in the SWD disposal well for a period not to exceed 12 
months. He said he will issue an approval for such a request.

I think this will be the most cost effective manner to manage recovered water 
over the next few months, particularly if recovery operations continue to 
proceed as favorably as they have to date and we can cease active remediation 
activities toward the latter part of this year. If you concur, I will obtain 
the letter from the disposal well operator and submit the request to the TRC.

Thanks, George

the emissions estimates for the auxillary engines at sta. 1-4.  Understand 
these are not actual emissions, but are emissions based upon potential to 
emit.  When these units were permitted actual testing data was not required, 
so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA 
approved document.  This has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers 
presented in the EPA document were high, therefore, this will allow us to net 
more emissions, if needed.  Emissions are presented for a single engine only

Subject: Engines and GF Status

Hi Jon,
This is a joint Duncan - Jim Linville reply.
First, for all intents and purposes, expect GF status to go away when the
legislature comes back to town.  With that in mind, what exactly is
happening with this engine.  Does the carburetor replace the mixer valves?
 If so, this must be one ancient engine!  And unlikely to get in under VERP
or any other program designed to end GF status.  Tell us more.
Duncan

Duncan,
I have some grandfathered gas compressor engines in west Texas.  We are
going to change out the old mixer valves and install carburetors on the
units as a maintenance activity.  Horsepower and emissions will not
increase.  I can maintain my grandfathered status, correct?  We will of
course document this activity and provide copies to the regional office.
Thanks,
Jon Fields

Jon, Here's the latest comment from Jim:
don't see why a test before the change and after the change using the same
analyzer would not demonstrate no increase in emissions.

Duncan,
Ok.  We'll test an engine.  This project involves 5 identical engines.  We
want to test just one - will you accept that?  Will you accept portable
analyzer test results?  These analyzers have been certified by the state of
New Mexico to be plus/minus 3% from full trailer tests.
Thanks,
Jon

IF there is no increase in emissions, this is probably not a modification
and the Grandfathered status would remain.  They would need to demonstrate
that there is no change.  This could require testing before and after the
change.

"Re: Sulfur Content Test Method","Roger, if EPA has approved other alternate methods for determining sulfur in 
fuel gas, can you approve of these for our sulfur methods?   The reason I ask 
is that we are not set up to do any of the applications mentioned in Appendix 
D.  We  have approved custom fuel monitoring schedules in place at 5 other 
compressor station locations and have been approved to use ""stain tubes"" or 
total sulfur analyzers.  These were issued by Region IX and Region VI.  I can 
send you copies of the approvals from the other Regions if that will help.  
If not, I would recommend that you write the permit with all the below 
referenced test methods and we will work out the details.  WIll it be 
possible to make a change to the permit after things quiet down a bit and we 
have more time to taylor the permit  for you and us?

Subject: Sulfur Content Test Method



Larry,

I am going on vacation for two weeks - my last day will be Oct. 31,
which is a little before the end of the comment period.  I am doing
everything I can to make sure the permits are ready to issue when the
comment period ends.  You have asked about using a sulfur analyzer.
Since that is not typical practice for facilities subject to NSPS GG, I
would have to research that.  Frankly, if you want your permits ASAP,
there really isn't time for that.  Does one of the test methods in
Appendix D of Part 75, which I've pasted below, work for you?  (I know
some don't.)  Please advise so we can keep the process moving.  Thanks.

2.3.3.1.2      Use one of the following methods when using manual
sampling (as applicable to the type of gas combusted) to determine the
sulfur
content of the fuel: ASTM D1072-90, ""Standard Test Method for Total
Sulfur in Fuel Gases"", ASTM D4468-85 (Reapproved 1989) ""Standard
Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and
Radiometric Colorimetry,"" ASTM D5504-94 ""Standard Test Method for
Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by
Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence,"" or ASTM D3246-81

Oxidative Microcoulometry"" (incorporated by reference under

"Re: Annual Report","John, I had asked Randi to complete an annual report for the F&G 2081 permit, 
as I did not want to have this hang over our head when EOTT's 2081 
application was reviewed.  This may be the annual report that were talking 
about.  As you remember, the 2081 requires an annual report for activities 
conducted for the prior year and it is due by Jan 10th of every year.  It was 
not been submitted for 1999 or  2000.  Because Randi has been personally 
involved in all construction activities at the North Coles Levee facility, I 
thought she would be the prime person to complie the reports for us and then 
we would submit.  If this is the annual report everyone is talking about, 
then, yes, I instructed her to do these, primarily, because she has been 
involved since the get go and she has the information.  She has also promised 
the reports to me by 2/15 for sumibttal to the F&G.

"RE: Staions 3 and 4 air permit comments to EPA","John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA 
permits for 3 and 4.  Briefly here they are.

First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours 
of operation for the generator.  The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation 
because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.  In talking to 
Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all 
applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not 
triggered.   This is there policy not regulation.  What is ironic is that 
they accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that 
they would apply any safety factor for their comfort.  Im concerned about the 
time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.  I need 
some guidance.  Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how long 
it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic 
converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?  In speaking 
with Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches the 
PSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of control 
technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.  I know 
time is of the essence.

Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and 
4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr 
or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppmvd 
for NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, at 
lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are 
40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.  We cant live with this.  In our application, we 
stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we 
applied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented 
this in lb.hr and tons/yr.  This would have covered us, but because the 
permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed  these limits during low loads 
and low temps.  I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit 
conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with 
with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he would 
bring this before his management.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.

 this is what Im trying for.; The permits dont hold us to a mass rate of 
emissions, just ppmvd.; We covered ourselves when we presented emisisons 
rates of t/yr in the application, but the EPA came back with NSPS limits, 
which of course hurt us when we operate at loads of less than 64%.; We can 
either cave in to their NSPS limits and when we get under low load condtions, 
just do a bunch of recycling which wastes gas, or we can spend some valuable 
time trying to get the EPA to give us emission limitations; in lb/hr or 
t/yr.; Im discussing this with the EPA permit engineer.;; He is checking with

 I agree with your comments.; Can't we get a lb/hr limit (based on the 
netting calculations) that we can live with?; We're only required to have a 
ppm limit that matches NSPS requirements, and that value would be a lot 
greater than 25 ppmv.

Subject: Con Edison's Capacity Release/Delivery Service Programs for the 2 
000/2001 Winter Season



As a result of feedback received at the July 6 reliability collaborative,
Con Edison has made the following changes to its capacity release/delivery
service programs for the 2000/2001 winter season.

First, to assist you in meeting your primary point obligations relating to
the firm load on our system that you are serving, Con Edison will make
available to Marketers 25,000 dt/day on Transco.  Your allocation based on
active customers in your group as of July 1, 2000 is
511 dt/day in the form of either:

  (a) a capacity release of Transco capacity at the
Transco maximum
   rate for the 12-month period November 2000 through
October 2001,
   or

  (b) a bundled citygate sale for November 2000 through
March 2001 priced
   as follows:

*  Inside F.E.R.C.,s first of the month index price at
    Transco/Zone 3 (Station 65) plus $1.00/dt.

 or;

  (c) a combination of the two adding up to 511 dt per
day.


Second, in addition to the above, we can make available to you 204 dt/day
during March 2001 as a bundled citygate sale on the same terms as set forth
above.

Third, with respect to the balance of capacity that you may require to meet
your primary point obligations,

  (a) There will be no citygate allocation requirements
for this winter, except for the 25% limitation on Texas Eastern. (i.e., you
may deliver     all of your gas to any of the
following receipt points, except that no more than 25% may be delivered to
Texas Eastern.

       Transco (Receipt
Point: 134th Street - Manhattan, Central Manhattan, Narrows or Long Beach)

       Tennessee (Receipt
Point:  White Plains)

  (b) We will permit you to meet the primary point
requirement using your Daily Load Following Service Quantity (for Load
Following Service)  or Daily Load Quantity (for Daily Delivery Service)
during November instead of the Average Day/Peak Month quantity used during
the remaining four winter months.

  (c) Prior to the winter, you can trade all or part of
your citygate allocation on Texas Eastern to another marketer, so long as
the aggregate entitlement for deliveries on Texas Eastern among all
marketers remains below 25% of the combined total allocation.

Please let us know on or before close of business Friday, July 28, 2000
which, if any, of the above-described services you are interested in.

NOTES:
1. We will advise you if additional capacity becomes available as a
result of actions taken by other marketers.
2. Bundled sales service is subject to the execution of a written
agreement (on mutually agreeable terms), including a take-or-pay commitment
and resolution of any creditworthiness issues.

PG&E apprising me of a meeting PG&E will be having with SW Gas this tuesday.  
They will be discussing PCB issues and the sampling results from the PG&E 
system.   From discussions with Louie, a media statement is being prepared by 
them which Louie has a copy of.  The statement is a little harsh and makes 
some statements which are incorrect.  Louie and I are planning to attend this 
meeting in Las Vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about 
rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on 
the Transwestern system with respect to PCB's.  The results of this meeting

"Testing at Station 3","When we do the emissions testing at C/S No. 3, Luepp, we should be aware of 
the positives and negatives.  The positives being the information which Steve 
and company will collect.  This appears to be a  very useful tool.  There is 
also is no permit emission limits associated with the permit at this 
facility.  There also exists the potential to pay lower emissions fees should 
this investigation show that the emissions from the units to be significantly 
lower than what was placed into the permit application.  The downside to this 
effort is that the data we collect may in fact show that our emissions fees 
which we have been paying actually under estimate those submitted in our 
application and we would more than likely be held accountable for the 
difference (1996 to the present).  Additionally, enforcement action could 
result by the Navajos.  I say this to apprise everyone of the positive and 
negative potentials involved in completing this study.  From the emission 
estimates which were placed into the permit application we included a 
defendable buffer or excess of emissions to account for variations in the 
temperature, humidity, engine age and poor engine mechanics should they 
exist.  

And finally, we have the unknown of not knowing what the three units actually 
emit.  These units have never been tested.  This uncertanty in itself may be 
the driver to know so as not to have a situation which was similar to what 
happened at Atoka No. 3 several months ago.

"Re: La Plata emissions issues","Rick, Terry had informed me that Solar had trouble with this unit in making 
its emissions guarantees, prior to shipping it to La Plata.  I was not aware 
of this when I permitted the unit.a couple of years ago. In an attempt to 
solve the problem, in November,  I had submitted a modification to the permit 
to the state of Colorado  requesting additional emissions as it appears the 
unit exceeds its permitted levels during the colder months.  I received a 
call form the state of Colorado and they said they are hesitant to approve of 
more emissions for us.  We reached an agreement with the state that they 
would remove the pound per hour limit and keep the ton per year requirement 
in an attempt to give us more operating room (the higher emissions months 
would be balanced by the warmer months which produce less emissions.  
However, after Terry went through the calculations we were still exceeding 
the permitted emission limits when we calculated yearly limits.  I dont know 
if Solar might have sold us a bill of goods but based upon emisisons 
calculations, the unit cant stay under the emissions guarantees that Solar 
promised.   We have notified the state of Colorado, as the permit requires 
and Im sure they will be following up on this.   Let me know what Solar 
says.......

Subject: La Plata emissions issues

Rick, the A-102 unit at LaPlata is at a point, using calculated rolling 
averages, that it is exceeding the tons per year emissions level of NOX, CO, 
and VOC. If we continue to run at these points it could mean an NOV. The 
numbers that we used on the permit are the guranteed emission numbers from 
Solar Turbines (per Larry Campbell). We were wondering if you could approach 
Leon O'Brien and/or Ernie Roberts on what Solar could do to remedy this 
problem. We feel that a communication coming from you and Rich might carry a 
little more weight then the LaPlata Gang could muster. Larry Campbell 
suggested that we try to remedy this through Solar Turbines first, before we 
pursue other avenues. Let us know if we can help in any 
way.                       Tnanks, Terry

"Weekly Envoironmental Activity Report","Transwestern Pipeline Company

Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for 
the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily 
set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This 
means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the 
allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This 
generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be 
operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority 
to apply a 10%safety factor.

For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers 
guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears 
that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit 
limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions 
limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.

Northern Natural Gas Company

A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to 
the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 
emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V 
facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not 
greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being 
conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. 

EOTT
A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove 
the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data 
on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for 
VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit. 

General

Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held 
next week in Albuquerque.

Do you see any benefit for some of us (maybe Mike Terraso, Larry Campbell and 
I - or some combination thereof) setting up a briefing session for you and 
your staff on PCBs.  We could provide some general information and well as 
Transwestern specific information/history that might make your group better 
equipped to discuss matters with some of our customers - particularly PG&E 
(although Jeff and Lorraine has been a quick study already). Based on Rod 
Boschee's last email they may be looking for us to replace their line 300 
before they entertain any increased flows.

"Ignition System Spraberry Plant, Permit Status","I want to bring interrested parties up to date on the issue of replacing the 
fuel mixers with carbuerators at  the Spraberry Plant.  It seems that this 
replacement was performed ONLY as a fuel savings activity and that there 
would be no increase in emissions or horsepower as a result.  According to 
the TNRCC, they will allow this activity provided that the above is true and 
that we prove that emissions and horsepower will not increase.  To do this 
they have requested that we conduct an emissions test on one of the units 
with the mixer on and then with the carbuerator on as a condition of their 
approval.  IE before and after testing.  I am going to request that we be 
allowed to do the testing with a portable emissions tester, which has been 
verified in side by side testing on New Mexico units as opposed to bringing 
in a third party referenced testing company.  Contractor testing runs about 
$3-5,000.  

A condition of all permitting issues is that the carbs are not supposed to be 
installed on the units (preconstruction) until approval has been given by the 
agency.  In this case, we will be allowed to install a carbuerator on the one 
unit to be tested but not on all units.  Should testing show other 
exceedances (emissions or Hp) in addition to fuel savings, this will trigger 
actions requiring perimtting.  Under the circumstances, I think it would be 
in the best interest of NNG to know for certain that we have not violated the 
grandfather status of the units and that if our activity requires permitting, 
we comply immediately.

I am sending out the letter request to the TNRCC today.  If approved, we 
should test ASAP.  Remember, that sampling ports in the exhaust stack of the 
unit to be tested will need to be constructed prior to testing.  Let me know 
if the Team will need a diagram showing the sampling port locations.

"RE: status, PCB pipeline modeling study","Louie, after the presentation MIchael gave, there were some issues about the 
data and predictions ie., like how much solvent do we really need to clean 
the pipeline and the injection intervals and locations, but not whether the 
solvent or technology would or would not work.  The data did show that  
terpenoline does remove PCB's from pipeline.  But because Penn State was so 
deeply involved in the modeling study, and we were still under the PG&E 
thumb, it appeared to be in the best interest of TW to see it to the end.   
There wasnt anyone who had any better suggestions or ideas.  The thought was 
that because of the amount of $$$$$$ we had previously spent, not to see it 
through would have meant 0 return  for the money we had invested.    And if 
it works, the money would have been wisely used. 

The real truth of course is when we do a trial run.  I signed a six month 
extension to the contract for Penn State (I sent out a memo on this) but not 
for additional $$$$$$.  They needed the extra time to complete the modeling 
study and data evaluation.  Last summer/fall, Tiny had been overseeing the 
operational side of this (ie terpenoline storage locations and coordinating 
injection points and the pigging activities).  When the decision is made to 
begin the injections and pigging, Tiny will be ready  and waiting......

Larry - Today I met with representatives from PNM and we discussed the 
information set forth below.  PNM recently tested for liquids at Rio Puerco 
and found liquids, specifically C5+ and think this is coming from TW.  Please 
call me to discuss.  Thanks.

We went out to our Rio Puerco interconnect and tried collecting a liquid 
sample for PCB sampling, but
had no liquid to collect.  So, Larry if you can let Lorraine know that we 
were unsuccessful in collecting this sample
I'd highly appreciate it. Thank you !

stations 1 and 2.  Based upon the plot plan provided by construction, the 
archeology discovery at station 1 does not occur within the area of proposed 
impact, even though  part of the discovery is within the facility fence.  The 
report  recommendation to the SHPO by the archeologist will be that during 
construction activities in this area, an archeologist be onsite to monitor 
and ensure that the site is not impacted.  They will also recommend that we 
fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline 
activities will not disrupt the site.  

I have asked that two reports be prepared for each site.  One report for each 
station covering the construction areas and the other reports to include the 
entire 40 acres at each compressor station.  All four reports will be 
submitted to Bret Fritch in Omaha on Monday, the 26th of March.

"weekly environmental activity report-Roswell Area","A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to 
discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual 
reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit. 2) developing an 
agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed 
to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G. 3) Presentation of the 
results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the 
Rogas project.

The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was 
approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety 
Division.  There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by 
application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 
3 piplines.  This is the only agency approval received as yet.

Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas 
pipeline.  Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available 
for purchase.  It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating 
this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that 
EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary 
acreage for the Rogas project.  This is a major plus for the project.

The rough draft of the baseline noise survey for the turbine installations in 
Az. was received.  Some changes will be made in each document.,  as the 
contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not 
valid or representative of the mitigation Transwetern will do.  The Navajo 
Nation has requested that an onsite survey be conducted at the C/S on the 
reservation (C/S 3 and 4)  for T&E plants and animals and archeology.  A 
contractor has been notified and surveys will be completed by 3/12. The F-1 
environmental report  for the FERC application will be submitted to Donna by 
this friday.   

The air permit applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.   A meeting 
with EPA in San Francisco has abeen set to discuss permitting the C/S 
facilities on the reservation on 3/20.  After the meeting, applications 
should be in front of the Navajo air permitting agency and the EPA within a 
week. Air permits are expected  within 5-7 months after submittal of the 
application.  During a conference call this week, a proposal was submitted to 
remove the existing auxillary generators and replace with 2 units at each 
location.  This will delay submittal of the air applications 3-4 days, 
assuming no major issues result.  One interesting issue that might develop is 
that one of the generators might possibly be a wind turbine.

"Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6","I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

"Re: Bakersfield Environmental Action Items","Ed, I would appreciate it very much if you would review the action item list 
from Scott Jones and choose which items are Koch's responsibility and which 
items  belong to EOTT, and let Scott and I know.  Ill contact Scott and have 
him send you the action item list for your review.  As I had previously 
mentioned, Scott and I have until 6/30 to complete the subsurface 
investigations and knowing which items are EOTT's and which are Koch's would 
greatly help us.  As Scott's server is down, Ill phone him and have him send 
you the action item list.  Again Thanks very much.

Sorry I have not responded sooner, but I've been tied up with the crude lines 
transaction.

The mercury contamination by the old meter shop and hydrocarbon contamiantion 
at the truck rack are Koch's responsibility.  Per EOTT/Koch contract, Koch 
must be allowed to do the remediation.  I sent Koch a letter in December 
requesting they undertake it.  I suggest a call (followed up by a letter) to 
Frank Van Ryn at Koch to set it up.  I'm happy to review or write such a 
letter.  But at this point, you guys should be coordinating with Koch for 
Koch to remediate.

If any other items on your audit need to be addressed (e.g., chromium), 
please let me know, as I will need to send a demand letter to Koch for them 
if they are Koch's responsibility.  Thanks.  --ETA

Louie/Ed I know you guys are busy, but because of the emphasis Enron places 
on ensuring that action items from consolidated audits are completed prior to 
the action item completion date, I really need to know how Scott and I are to 
proceed on the subsurface drilling activities for potential contamination at 
the Bakersfield Fractionator.  The scheduled completion date for six of the 
items is 6/30.  I understand the there is an issue concerning Koch's 
individual and shared responsibility for some of the issues identified during 
the audit.  Rich Jolly has contacted me asking me when the drilling will 
begin, as he does not want to see us exceed the 6/30 date and have the items 
show up as deliquent in his region.  Whatever you can do to assist us in 
either initiating the investigations or placing a hold on the drilling would 
be greatly appreciated.

Meeting Planning Team,
This like it is on target at this point.  You should probably circulate the
draft to Pribble, after you are comfortable with it, to get his preliminary
buy-in.  Now, I do have a few questions.  Is someone talking with the
Little America Hotel in Flagstaff and blocking out enough rooms for our
meeting?  When can we get some preliminary dates (How about the week of
April 22, 2002?)???   If that week is not good, then go to the second week
in May as I will have serious conflicts with the first week of May.  Also,
who will be in charge of planning the evening dinners?  I would like to
talk with that person as I have a couple of ""fun"" ideas to offer about
where we might go for dinner.  Thanks to both the North Safety Team and the
SW Environmental Team for taking a lead role in this.  John

"RE: FW: Red Rock Expansion Station 4","Jerry, I have not cancelled the Station 4 air permit.  I have spoken to Roger 
Kohn,EPA permit engineer,  about the possibility of not doing the turbine 
installation at station 4 only due to what you described as not enough market 
commitment.  My plans are to hold off on making any decisions and have the 
EPA issue the station 4 permit.  If we do not initiate any construction 
pertaining to the turbine or auxillary generators, then the new permit doesnt 
apply and we can still operate under the existing permit which was issued 
about 2 years ago.  In Enron, 6 months is an eternity and who knows what will 
happern then?  By having the permit, but not constructing, we will be  OK.  
If we decide to do the turbine project  within the period of time that the 
permit is valid, then were ahead of the game.  If not, and a more firm 
decision is made to not do anything in the future, Ill contact EPA and 
request termination of the permit.  Usually, the agency places a caveot that 
if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit 
automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions 
of the existing permit for the facility..

John, I agree with your points.  Has EPA already been notified?  If not, we 
should put the proper spin on it, which, in my opinion, should come from 
Marketing.  Something like, ""we tried hard, and continue to try hard, to sell 
more capacity, but the market has not cooperated, so we must defer (not 
cancel) the station for now.  We haven't even told FERC yet, so you are the 
first to know.""

Larry,
(Caveat: The following is just an observation at this point and the view 
expressed is my own).  What concerns me most about this scenario is that we 
pressured the EPA Region IX quite a lot to get this permit and now we are 
just going to let a portion of it go ""null and void"".  At least, the portion 
applicable to Station 4.  I know we didn't lean on the EPA as hard as we did 
the AZDEQ, but we did repeatedly call them.  Even the FERC Environmental 
Staff was calling Region IX asking when were they going to get the draft out 
- because the FERC was under the assumption that we needed all or none.  

At a time when Enron's veracity has come into question all across America, 
its too bad there isn't a better way to handle this.  Don't be surprised the 
next time you go in asking for expedited treatment on a federal air permit, 
if the regulators look at you with a ""question"" mark.  I wouldn't say we 
""burned bridges"", but we definitely used some ""green stamps"".  There are only 
so many ""green stamps"" that we can use with an agency and we used a bundle on 
this one - and now we don't need it.  John

Arnold, I take care of cancelling the air permit for Station 4.  Based upon

This is to confirm our conversation today, the Transwestern Red Rock
expansion currently is scheduled to replace the existing units at Station
1, 2, 3 and 4 with a new unit at each station.  Due to market conditions,
Marketing and Operations have agreed to officially remove Station 4 from
the Red Rock expansion.  We will need to prepare (overhaul) the existing
units at Station 4 to flow the new incremental 120 mmcf/d.
With this information Environmental Affairs can withdrawal the air permit
application for Station 4 and Regulatory Affairs can make necessary
filings.
Thanks for your help.

"Additional Soil Investigations, North Coles Levee","After reveiwing the documents entitled, ""Baseline Environmental Investigation 
of Arco North Coles Levee Plant 8, Rogas Loading Facility and Associated 
Natural Gas Pipeline Systems Kern County, California"" and ""Report of 
Preliminary Asessment Sampling North Coles Levee Gas Plant Loading Rack Area 
Tupman, California"", it appears that the following areas should be 
investigated further to detemine horizontal and vertical extent of  
identified contamination from the above referenced reports:

 Tank 15 area-  total petroleum hydrocarbons

 Glycol reboiler area- total petroleum hydrocarbons

 Hot oil heater area- total petroleum hydrocarbons

   Wash rack area- lead

 Propane comp. area lead  
    total petroleum hydrocarbons
    chromates

 Cooling tower area- chromates

 Compressor area- BTEX
    chromates
    lead

In the ""Baseline Environmental Investigation"" report, sampling was only 
conducted to an approximate depth of 2.5'.  I am not comfortable with basing 
decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth, in leau of the 
fact that  many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move 
vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas.  This 
is indeed the case for chromates.  I based my recommendations for metal 
concentrations on the federal RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste target levels 
for metals and evaluated  the TPH and BTEX levels with the  underground 
storage tank guidlines for California.  There were references to a 1989 
document in the ""Baseline"" report for specific parameters, but there may have 
been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and 
therefore, I used 10,000 ppm which is a general action level for most states 
for total petroleum hydrocarbons.  Again, I did not evaluate the mercury or 
the loading rack issues.

One last issue.  As you know, identification of contamination is usually 
accomplished by sight observations of visible contamination, knowledge of 
processes and or history.  Report results of the surface contamination do not 
show there to be an immediate environmental concern.  Due to the age of the 
facility, there may be concerns which were not identified in the reports.  
However, based upon the locations of the preliminary samplings which were 
conducted throughout the facility, it appears that the information presented 
in the reports would be adequate to address suspected contamination at the 
facility.

"Latest deconning Activity-Topock Lateral","As a result of the latest meeting with PG&E over the greater than 500 ppm PCB 
liquids collection at the PGE Topock C/S filter separator (F/S), presented 
below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred 
6/29/00.

Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the 
cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water 
mixture).  Diesel was not used in the deconning process.  The only equipment 
cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S.  Transwestern's filters in its separator 
were replaced,  but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit.   
The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator.

The following samples were collected during this project:

On the Transwestern side:

 1. Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters 
were removed.  Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of   
PCB's.  (Not 100 sq. cm. sample)

 2. A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator 
at the Selexol Plant.  The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 

 3. Composite sample of the fine powdery rust  which had collected in the 
bottom of the F/S.   Approximte volume one cup.  
 
 4. Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S. Visible appearance of 
the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and    virtually 
unstained.  A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter 
confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S. 

 5. A sample of an unused clean stocked filter.  This was a control sample. 


On the PG&E side:

 1. A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter 
separator prior to deconning.  Approx. volume one cup

 2. Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the 
F/S.  An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S   prior 
to deconning was approximately one gallon.

 3. Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100 
cm sq. wipe)

 4. Used filter media from the F/S.  The operation of the F/S filters are 
designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter.  Composite samples   
were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters.

 5. Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls. 

The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process 
was the volume and  buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material 
which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount 
of rust colored material which was present  in Transwestern's F/S .  As 
previously mentioned, samples were collected of  both materials.  The only 
difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the 
volume.  It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of 
99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had 
over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S.  The small amount of rust 
materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging 
activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S.  I will have 
reprensentataive samples of both materials.  

Photographs  were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and 
will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in Flagstaff with 
PG&E.
on the 13th of July.  Analytical results will also be completed at this time.

"Status Air Compliance, EOTT Tanks, Midland Region"," Bill, presented below is a summary of the Midland EOTT tank compliance 
status verified by fax and telephone with the teams.  This information is 98% 
complete until actual onsite verification occurs, which is set up for the 
month of August. I plan on visiting each team and tank in the Midland 
Region.  However, until the site visits are completed, this should give you a 
good idea of the status of the EOTT pipeline tanks stand with respect to air 
compliance.  

1. Tank compliance database, general.  The database, which included 366 tanks 
at the onset, has been reduced to 106 EOTT P/L tanks.  Tanks operated by EOTT 
Trucking; non-EOTT tanks;  tanks sold, removed, duplicated, or otherwise 
listed in error, were removed (and saved in another file).  Of the 106 tanks 
listed, 80 are active, 12 are inactive, 10 are permanently out-of-service, 
and 4 are abandoned in place.

 
2. Permit issues. 
Federal

a. Title V permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Electric pumps are 
the norm  at EOTT tank farms, so site emissions are exclusively from the 
tanks and do not exceed 100 TPY.  (Only Crane Station has a Title V permit).  
This statement is based on &worst case8 calculations using EPA TANKS 4.0 
which indicated that in a:

5,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  3.6 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 720 
turnovers) produced annual emissions of 48 tons (2 tpy breathing loss, 46 tpy 
working loss). 

55,000 bbl EFR tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 255 
turnovers) produced annual emissions of 9 tons (6 tpy breathing loss, 3 tpy 
working loss). 

55,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 
255 turnovers) produced annual emissions of 4 tons (1 tpy breathing loss, 3 
tpy working loss). 


State 

b. State permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Sixty-three (63) of 
the 106 tanks were constructed before 1971 (and not modified or 
reconstructed). These tanks are grandfathered and require no permit as long 
as throughputs do not significantly change.  

All of the EOTT Texas tanks of any size constructed/modified/reconstructed 
after 1971 and equipped with a floating roof are exempt under Standard 
Exemption 86, currently known as Permit-by-Rule 106.478.   None of the tanks 
store material with a true vapor pressure above 11.0 psia, and total actual 
VOC emissions authorized under exemption from any site does not exceed the 30 
TAC 106.4 limit of 25 tpy.   No registration for the exemption is necessary, 
since the tanks are not located in a nonattainment county for ozone.

New Mexico,s permitting program for petroleum storage tanks is being 
developed but,  currently, there are no requirements. Therefore, all EOTT 
tanks in New Mexico meet state permit requirements.  However, when finalized, 
the control requirements for tanks in New Mexico will not be more stringent 
than the federal NSPS Subpart Kb.  Therefore, a tank equipped with a floating 
roof would be authorized to store petroleum product with a true vapor 
pressure up to 11.0 psia.   Only the four fixed roof tanks at Maljamar and 
the one at Loco Hills could be affected. 

4. Recordkeeping and inspection issues.  The grandfathered tanks have no 
requirements. For tanks subject to NSPS Subpart K, only capacity data is 
required.  Tanks subject to Ka and Kb require inspection, repairs if 
warranted, and recordkeeping.  

Note: Especially for some of the older tanks, neither a manufacturer,s 
identification plate or 
strapping table is available.  I would suggest that we pursue a records 
search of old EOTT files to verify construction dates.  I dont know where to 
start on this.

5. Specific compliance/requirements summary.  The tabled information 
identifies the following:

Federal
- 2 tanks (McElroy 58005, Loco Hills 4602) may not be meeting NSPS control 
requirements
- 4 tanks (Maljamar 1519-1522)  may not be meeting NSPS control requirements

(All are cone tanks,  subject to Ka/Kb.  Based on a capacity > 472 bbls and 
product true vapor pressure > 2.18 psia, the tanks require a floating roof or 
closed vent system);

- 28 tanks at 18 sites are subject to NSPS K/Ka/Kb inspection and/or 
recordkeeping requirements:
K (recordkeeping of tank capacity, dimensions only):
Foster 787, 790 
Quito-Hendrick 58044
Sands 15089A
Lynch 1511;

Ka/Kb (inspection & recordkeeping):
  Burger 58018 (if returned to active status)
China Grove 56007-56010
  Garden City 56003
Haskell, N. 58509 (if returned to active status)

  Maljamar 1519-1522
  Sonora 1515 (if returned to active status)
Thomas 68413

State

- Crane Station has an emissions potential > 100 tpy and is therefore 
required to remit a TNRCC emissions fee, due by 11/1 each year: 
 

 10 sites are subject to an NSPS Subpart (i.e., K, Ka, Kb) and are therefore 
required to remit a  TNRCC emissions fee, due by 11/1 each year: 
China Grove, Foster, Garden City, Haskell S., McAfee, McElroy, Midland, 
Quito-Hendrick, Scurry, Wildfire;

- 8 sites need a TNRCC account number from the Regional office: China Grove,  
Haskell S., McAfee, McElroy, Midland, Quito-Hendrick, 
Scurry, Wildfire; 
I have initiated the request to the TNRCC for account number for the above 
sites
 
- 4 additional sites which, if returned to active status, need a TNRCC 
account number and are subject to a TNRCC emissions fee, due by 11/1:
Burger, Haskell N., Sands, Sonora;

- 3 sites that are not subject to a TNRCC emissions fee, but paid one last 
year:
Adair, Hendrick, Ozona.

6. Specific inspection requirements: Primary and secondary seal inspections. 
 See Attachment A for list of tanks affected. 
 API Standard 653-based  &In-service8 inspection checklist.
 Internal/External Floating Roof Inspection Report checklists.
 Sketch and Calculation for Perimeter Seal Gap Measurement.


Comprehensive &Out-of-service8 inspections are performed after the tank is 
cleaned and should 
be budgeted at approximately $5000. each.  This will include a thorough floor 
scan but will not include required repairs.   

 



ATTACHMENT A

IFR/EFR Storage Tanks
Seal Inspections



For the tanks equipped with a floating roof and subject to Ka or Kb, the 
following requirements apply:

- Tanks with an IFR (internal floating roof) require an internal inspection 
every 5 years
(however, the interval can be extended to every 10 years if an annual visual 
inspection is performed):

Burger 58018 (if returned to service)
China Grove 56007-56010
Garden City 56003
Haskell S. 58023 (and 58022, if returned to service)
McAfee 1523
Midland 1516
Scurry 1517
Wildfire 1524
Livingston Ridge 68414 
  Loco Hills 66417, 66418
  Thomas 68413



- Tanks with an EFR (external float. roof) require measurement of the gap 
between the shell wall and the primary seal every 5 years, and between the 
shell wall and the secondary seal  annually:

Foster 787, 790
Quito-Hendrick 58044
Lynch 1511
Sonora 1515 (if returned to service)

a couple of crises I had to address,  Im still realing from the impact.  I 
have attached for your review the agreement which we are in the process of 
finalizing with the Wild Turkey Federation.  Take a look at the document and 
let me know what you think.  After your review we can make the necessary 
changes and modifications.  I have been advised by our legal department that 
each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by Enron will need a 
separate contract, with the RMEF, so what we decide for Transwestern, will 
undoubtably work for the others.  Thanks for your patience in this.

"Re: Building Colors","Byron/Tiny, I spoke to Ken Jacobs with the Forest Service and have attached 
his e mail below concerning the Forest Sevice's choice for the building.  I 
have informed him that our new piping and ancillary equipment will remain 
white which is consistent with the existing equipment.  He had no problems 
with this.  I also had asked him if there was a name for the brown which the 
FS uses on their signs and he did not know of a specific name, so I think the 
best thing would be to match as closely as possible.


The Forest Service would like the new Compressor Building to be painted
dark brown.  The color should be close to the color that we use for our
signs.  Call me at 520-214-2464 if you would like to discuss this.

Need to know the current color scheme for TW for the new buildings.

Think its white wall and roof with blue trim.

Do we have to hide anything at any of the sights behind desert tan.

Please advise.

"Re: Project Sun Devil EIS","Kevin, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner as I have been out of 
touch for the last week.  I read John's message to you and agree with him 
that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public 
support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up and 
bite us.  As you may know, Flagstaff is one of those areas where there is 
much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and there 
does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their agenda to 
keep development to a minimum.  I will forward to you a memo from David 
Roensch, team advisor in the Flagstaff area, of an article he found providing 
the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagstaff area.  
Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled the Bureau 
of Land Management, State of Arizona,  State Historic Preservation Office and 
the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flagstaff and 
Phoenix.  I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet, but will let you 
know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if there  appears to 
be trouble on the horizon.   John and I have briefly traded thoughts on this 
project and we would  like to take a more proactive approach  ""up front"" with 
regard to public participation and input prior to breaking ground.  Its hard 
to deal with public issues when construction is underway. 

As for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies, you are correct in assuming 
that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will 
require very little capital, as long as we limit and ensure our construction 
activities to the existing right of way.  Proceeding south from Flagstaff to 
Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest.  Once the 
pipeline corridor is identified and staked, surveys will need to be completed 
for the following:   threatened and endangered plants and animals, archeology 
surveys for bones, artifacts, relics etc, noise surveys should this portion 
of the project require installation of horsepower.  The FERC will require an 
EIS (environmental impact statement) and environmental report to be 
conducted.  These activities include not only the environemntal issues but 
also things like socioeconomics, land use soils, geology etc.  Past 
consttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this 
greatly expidites the process (John has eluded to this previously).  Due to 
the rough terrain and topography of the land south of Station 2 into Phoenix 
makes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount  for 
the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entire 
proposed right of way (140 miles) from station 2 into Phoenix will need to be 
walked and surveyed by several people.  I would rather wait until we can 
identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of the 
surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a $$$$ figure.   
However, because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate, I 
would recommend an amount of $70,000 to 90,000  for the baseline 
environmental work and this might be a little light, in the event the surveys 
identify something.......please dont hold me too close to this number as it 
is a WAG contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at 
this time.  Having the pipeline corridor identified on a map will greatly 
assist in the environmental budgeting for this project.

Subject: Project Sun Devil EIS

I received the vmail from Bill last week basically stating there were no 
environmental deal killers for this new gas pipeline project, at least not 
from a 30,000 foot high level survey.  

My question is now what are our next steps?  I am building a work order 
authorization for some minimal dollars to get things like the ROW, EIS, etc. 
scoped out.  Assuming we have necessary market support, what would it cost to 
move to the next level on the EIS?  What do we get for our money?  I am 
mostly concerned about the ""greenfield"" portion of the line that would run 
from Flagstaff to Phoenix.  

Please call me at your earliest convenience to discuss an action plan.

Subject: Nature Conservancy Meeting

Larry, per your request following our phone conversation today I'm forwading 
a brief note regarding our dinner meeting last night with the Arizona Chapter 
of the Nature Conservancy.  

Hank Hull (Flagstaff Team leader) and I met with Edward Smith, the Northern 
Arizona Program Ecologist with the Nature Conservancy, here out of 
Flagstaff.  The purpose of the meeting was to make introductions between Ed 
and Hank and to informally discuss opportunities in which the Flagstaff Team 
could support the local chapter.  The Flagstaff Team made a committment in 
their Team Objectives and each team member in their Peer Committments to 
support the Conservancy in some manner this year.  To date all eight of the 
Flagstaff Team members (2 positions currently vacant) have taken advantage of 
the free membership offered through ETS.  Also, Ed was quite impressed with 
ETS's sponsorship of the employee and family memberships.  I won't get into 
the details but, it was obvious that opportunities will exist for the Team to 
become active in local activities.  So, as a follow up to the meeting, Ed 
will make a list of the areas and locations the Conservancy is in need of 
help and forward this list to Hank who will then poll the various Team 
members and solicit volunteers.  This may take a couple of weeks to get up 
and running but we should be well on our way by June.  Our goal, for now, 
will be to committ on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis to providing a 
given number of volunteer hours.  I'll keep you posted on how things 
progress.  

Ed also, offered to come out to one of the Team's meetings and give the group 
an overview of the Arizona Chapter of the Nature Conservancy and discuss our 
involvement with the entire Team.  And last but not least, when you, Bill, 
John, Rich and Randy come out for your West End field trip we may be able to 
coordinate a dinner get togeather with Ed to discuss any topics of interest.  
Just a thought.....   

Have a good week.......

"Additonal Information Concerning PG&E","On a related note, I spoke to Vector concerning the equipment which was 
suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system.  It is as follows:

 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 
2-10.84 drip locations

The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above 
PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000.  

I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their 
C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs 
to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision 
is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done 
during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also 
need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology 
to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes 
to 36"".  

One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas 
compressors.  In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were 
found at regulated levels.....

"Re: Station 2 Concerns","Terry, the entire facility has not been disturbed.  Only most of it.  Id say 
approx 70%.  The other 30% has been impacted but not tot the point of 
disturbing all the vegetation, just foot and vehicle traffic.  I dont have 
problem with saying the above, but keep in mind, the facility has been there 
and just because the trees havent been disturbed, doesnt mean that the 
understory beneath the trees has been pristine.   It has always been 
Transwetern's policy to maintain an environmetnal presence at all of its 
locations, especially at sites where there is some aesthetic value (scenery 
wildlife etc).  I dont have a problem with including resource reports 3 and 7 
for vegetation and soils.  I have received a verbal from the US Fish and 
Wildlife and they agreed with the intent in my letter to them that pipline 
activites at each location tend to preclude any impacts to sensitive or 
critical habitats.  In addition, the adjacent lands are of the same habitat 
types as that which are contained within the facility and therefore, would 
not be an issue of habitat loss.   There are not any old TW hands around to 
positively verify that the site was cleanred and there has been natural 
encroachment of the trees into the area, I seriously doubt it.  Again, TW 
tried to mantain a postive presence at each site, but did utilize the sites 
for their intended purpose.

In Arizona, we do not have a blanket approval for discharges of hydrostatic 
testwater.  We do however plan to use new pipe and water supplied either from 
the closest City (ie Flagstaff for station 2 construction) or from a drinking 
well source.  In any event, we will test the water prior to discharge and 
ensure that the discharge will stay on the facility property to soak into the 
ground.  I cant imagine that there will be large volumes of hydro water as we 
dont plan on installing a large amount of new pipe.

If we need to discuss the above, give me a call

Subject: Station 2 Concerns


Larry,

I gave the tree issue at Station 2 some thought and I have a couple of
concerns regarding the environmental report.  The report is being written,
based on the fact that all construction will occur within the station yard
and on previously disturbed ground.  If we impact areas (even within
existing facilities) that were not previously disturbed we are required to
include environmental data about those areas.

So the first question is whether the entire station yard has been
""previously disturbed"".  To help determine this, I downloaded a USGS aerial
(1996) of the station from the internet and the trees occurring within the
station yard look to be the same age/size as those surrounding the station.
This would indicate that the areas within the station covered with trees
have not been ""previously disturbed"".  A copy of the aerial is attached.

However, it is conceivable that the site was cleared prior to initial
construction and the trees simply grew back.  Unfortunately, I don't have
that information and don't know if you do either.  And let me point out that
my concern is not whether Transwestern will receive approval to construct,
but the amount of information supplied in the report.  I want to feel
comfortable that we are supplying the required information to FERC.

For this project, that would primarily include a description of the existing
vegetation and soils (resource report 3 and 7).  All we would really need is
a brief description of the existing vegetation and soils, and how much will
be permanently impacted, etc. However, we did not budget any time to obtain
this information, nor did we anticipate the need for site visits.

My hope is that we can find an answer to whether the site was previously
disturbed or not.  If not, I hope to come up with some verbiage that
everyone is comfortable with to satisfy the FERC requirements.  Otherwise,
we will have to obtain the necessary information, and that's beyond our
initial scope.

If you have had any biological reports done for the area on other projects,
that may provide enough information.  Again, it only needs to be brief.
Also, we need to verify for the other 3 stations that we are constructing in
previously disturbed areas.

Lastly, Arnold has indicated that the hydro-test water will come from
existing water source at each station and that it will be discharged under
Transwestern's blanket permit.  Please verify...and I think we should
provide a copy of the blanket permit with the filing.

After you have had a chance to think about this, please call and we can
discuss.

Terry.

"Re: FW: question on Transwestern","Donna/Arnold  sorry about not making the conference call today.  The state of 
New Mexico showed up at my office this  morning and made a surprise 
inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.  I felt the need to tag along 
with them.... 

Heres the way it is.  The EPA is required to address all federal concerns 
when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.  Even when it comes to 
an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed 
ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species 
Act (ESA).  This is not a new issue with the EPA.  Im having the same thing 
happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the 
status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.  The 
permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air 
group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.  I 
told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that 
the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken 
care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.  (As you remember, the Navajo Nation 
verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station 
sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the 
Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a 
call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys 
with the EPA.  Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as 
to whether surveys would be required or not.  I told him that we were 
expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would 
schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.  He advised me not to 
do this.  I think his decision had something to do with  the EPA usurping 
authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without 
Indian consent.  He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to 
whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo 
Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these 
types of issues. 

Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first 
became an issue, but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly  delay 
issuance of the permits.  Ill send something out via email when I hear from 
the EPA.

Larry -Arnold reported in the weekly meeting today that the EPA is requesting 
a T&E survey at Stations 3 & 4 prior to issuing air permits.  Don't know if 
you anticipate this being a problem or lengthy process, but Steve Burns sent 
the following message to me (which I thought I had forwarded to you-sorry 
looks like I didn't).  Any way, I don't know if he could help push the 
process along or not or if the permits he is talking about are ROW only....if

Thanks, Donna.
The reason I ask is that we've been fighting a long political/policy issue 
here in Washington on rights-of-way across federal lands.  
Thus far the issue has focused on telecommunications (EBS and fiber optic 
cables).  The agencies we've been pitted against are the BLM and Forest 
Service, and the issue is the federal land agencies have tried to raise ROW 
fees and rents to exorbitant levels in order to get more money out of 
companies.
The agencies have recently said that what they tried to do to fiber cables 
they'll also do to pipelines.  
Two weeks ago, I spoke at a pipelines conference in New Orleans on this 
issue.  El Paso pipelines told me they've had a tough time getting 
compression station upgrade permits from the BLM for their pipeline expansion 
into California.
My request therefore would only be that IF you have any problems with the 
Forest Service in obtaining permits or new rights-of-way, and you think you 
might need some help, please feel free to let me know.  We meet regularly 
with Dept of Agriculture senior staff, and should soon meet with the new 
Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth.  We could help if you have any problems.
(Can't help you with the Navajo Nation, though!  But seriously, we'd always 
like to learn if you have problems on Indian lands as well.)

Subject: BTU factor


Due to internal issues, the BTU factor, previously reported to the marketers
for the month of August 2000 as 1.027, was incorrect.


The correct BTU factor for August 2000 is 1.029.

Any questions may be directed to my attention.

"Re: TW Laguna Station Remediation","Thanx George for the update.  

Norm would you mind visiting with Ms. Bernacik and explaining to her the 
difference between the excavation area where the underground tanks were 
removed and the landfarm area?  If need be we can write her another letter 
requesting the closure and backfilling of the underground storage tanks.

Subject: TW Laguna Station Remediation

I called Ms. Bernacik this afternoon regarding several issues. 
1.)  Ms. Bernacik indicated that the POEP has formed a Superfund division 
which is lead by a fellow named Mr. Rizvi. Mr. Rizvi had contacted Ms. 
Bernacik and requested the opportunity to be present at the site during the 
next semiannual sampling event. This event is tentatively scheduled for the 
week of June 19th. I am to notify Ms. Bernacik when we have set a firm date 
for sampling. 
2.)  Ms. Bernacik asked if we had received an extension to the off-site 
access permit from the Pueblo so that we could install the three additional 
wells. I indicated that I believe the extension was issued and Norm had 
picked it up but I wasn't certain. I followed-up with Norm and he has picked 
up the permit. Drilling activities are scheduled for the week of June 5th.
3.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about our request for no further action on the UST 
removal. Ms. Bernacik indicated that Norm Moreno at the POEP had responded to 
her with comments on the request and recommended against closing the issue. 
Ms. Bernacik said that she would send us a copy of Mr. Moreno's letter. At a 
minimum, the Pueblo will require continued monitoring. This does not change 
our monitoring plan since we had already proposed continued monitoring of the 
UST area wells as part of our facility wide groundwater monitoring program. 
However, Ms. Bernacik also indicated that the Pueblo may require one or two 
additional monitor wells in the former UST area.
4.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about backfilling the former UST excavation area. 
Ms. Bernacik indicated that her office had already issued an approval of TW's 
request to close the landfarm. I asked again about backfilling the excavation 
but was having difficulty communicating my interest was backfilling the 
excavation rather than closure of the landfarm. I reviewed the letter from 
Ms. Bernacik regarding closure of the landfarm and it does not specifically 
address backfilling the excavation. I believe that Ms. Bernacik is under the 
impression that her office has already approved backfilling the excavation, 
if we still want to get this in writing, it may be best for Norm to visit 
with Ms. Bernacik at her office in order to better explain what we need.

"Compliance Order, P-1 C/S","Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air 
Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 
C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this 
issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further 
actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was 
received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of 
interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing 
smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide 
vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to 
simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received 
permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, 
Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher 
turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not 
make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by 
Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is 
authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern 
from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this 
turbine at their descretion.

In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a 
emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than 
the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 
were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be 
mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple 
cycle.   

  Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to 
be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the 
Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern 
has 30 days to request another hearing. 

Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and 
handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a 
conference call for sometime next week?

"Results of the PG&E Filter Separator Cleaning","Just a short message to apprise everyone of the cleaning results performed on 
the filter separator from the Transwestern M/S.  Wipe tests taken of the 
interrior portions of the separator prior to cleaning revealed PCB results 
of: 360, 500 and 520 microgram.   This was not a standard wipe taken of a 
specific area.  These wipes were taken over large areas to determine 
presence/absence of PCB's within the separator.  After the cleaning operation 
was completed, three wipe samples were taken of the interrior portions of the 
separator.  All results showed non detect at less than 1.0 microgram.  I feel 
we can be fairly certain that the separator is free of residual PCBs.  

Jeff, would you pass this information on to your counterpart for PG&E?

"Environmental findings, Koch South Texas Records Review","Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were 
identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch 
facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year.

All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the 
Koch office  were reviewed.  Assumptions were made that the environmental 
records were complete for all assets included in the sale.  Primary emphasis 
was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a 
sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of 
crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical 
assets which were reviewed. 

Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the 
following:

  Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee 
payments were documented 

  NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks 
were documented 

  Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date

  SARA compliance and reporting had been completed

  SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112

  Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were 
available for review

   There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site 
included in the asset for sale
     (permits for the remediation activity is in place)

  Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were 
documented

Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified 
which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a 
considered a major environmental  liability.  This statement is again based 
upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the 
data room for the assets in question.  It should also be stated that this 
analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch 
has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge 
during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files.

Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a 
recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to 
each location to verify findings from the records review.   Also, due to the 
past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract 
conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for 
discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have 
occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.

"Re: Ralph Komai, Training Presentation","Mike, I spoke to Ralph and he gave me an open week of April 17th in San 
Francisco.  He thought that one day would be more that adequate.  I need to 
have somebody contact the PG&E side for their availablity during that week.  
Should I or someone else contact Rod Bosche or let Louie do this from his end 
with our legal contacting their legal? 

Some of the highlights that I had requested to Ralph for his presentation was 
the following:
 
  PCB's are a contaminant, just as benzene is, which occurs naturally in the 
gas.  Health issues of PCBs in pipeline are not a concern especially from a  
customer and employee standpoint (the name PCB lends itself to public outcry 
of the unknown)

 Removal of PCB's is best accomplished by managing liquids, not deconing

 Fiilter separators are a proven method of PCB removal

 Transwestern's proactive assistance with SoCal on their system to manage 
their PCBs

 Most pipelines on the east coast have PCB's and no adverse environmental 
impacts have occurred

I spoke with Ralph Komai, PCB expert for SoCal, concerning his availability 
to conduct a training session for PG&E and enlighten them on the reality of 
PCB's in natural gas pipelines.  He has stated that he would be available to 
do this as long as Transwestern picks up his expenses and hourly rate  
($200.00/hr).  As per your approval, Louie, I will inform Ralph that we are 
in agreement with his conditions and I will schedule a day when he would be 
available in California to put on the training for PG&E.

"Due Diligence, Equilon Pipeline Company","Louie/John, this memo summerizes the results of the environmental due 
diligence which was performed on the Texas Panhandle and Cortez, Colorado 
portions of Equilon pipline system for which EOTT may be interested in 
purchasing.  This memo presents those environmental issues which may be or 
were identified as a potential environmental concern.  

Lefors (Texas Panhandle Segment)

Assets on this portion of the system which may have environmental  issues 
were the following:  1-80,000 bbl. liquids product storage tank, 41 small 
tank batteries consisting of 1-3 product storage tanks each.  Average tank 
size is 210 bbl.  Approximately 15 tank locations are within 1/4 mile of an 
existing waterway.  There are stream and river crossings included in this 
package.  The pipeline crossings viewed appeared to have sufficient  soil 
coverage and did have block valves on the upstream and downstream portions of 
the pipeline crossings.  

1. Clean Air Act.  There were no records kept at any office or location which 
would assist in the determination of compliance with Title III, or Title V.  
The  following documents were not present:  emissions inventories and or 
records of fees paid, O&G MACT compliance (HAP's),  operating permits.  NSPS  
Supart Kb compliance could not be determined also.  The 80,000 bbl tank 
construction date was in the 1930's and has a fixed roof.  It has a concrete  
bottom and the  tank has never been emptied for inspection.  No  Railroad 
Commission 653 inspection has ever been conducted.

2. Clean Water Act.  Although soil berm and containments were present around 
all tanks that were inspected, SPCC plans were not available at any 
location.   Interviews with the Equilon personnel stated that there had never 
been a reportable release from this tank.  In addition, location Texaco MB  
Davis pump  station had a small 3'x4' UST which received liquids from leaking 
packing material which had overflowed and visible soil staining was present.  
At this  location a T-stand pipe had been constructed into the soil berm to 
allow discharge of rainwater from the containment area.  This water 
discharged into  an ephermal arroyo which ultimately collects into the North 
Fork of the Red River, a perennial stream.

3. NESHAPS.  At the Lefors Station, there exists several joints of new and 
used pipe which is suspected of having external coating and pipe wrapping   
containing asbestos.

4. NORMS.  A NORM survey has not been conducted on any portion of the assets 
which are identified in the bid package.

5. Soil Staining.   There was minor soil staining at all locations inspected.

6. There is one active groundwater remediation in progress identified as the 
""10 mile hole"".  Equilon will retain ownership of this issue.  There had been 
two  pipeline remediation projects for which Equilon had reported to the TRRC 
and had remediated the site.

7. TSCA.  One electrical transformer was discovered at the Lefors Station.   
It had been tested and determined to not have PCB's.

8. Safe Drinking Water Act.  There was an abandoned drinking water well at 
the Lefors Station.  It had not been in service for an undetermined period of 
time. 

9. RCRA.  There was an abandoned out of service Fox boro meter at the Lefors 
Station.  Status of the potential releases of mercury could not be visibally  
determined.

Bug-Patterson Gathering System (Cortez, Colorado)

This system includes the following:

 Lady Bug Station  minor incidental equipment at this location. 

1. There were no environmental issues at this site from assets owned by 
Equilon.  Adjacent to this site was a producer site which had been blowing   
hydrocarbon liquids into an earthern unlined pit.  There was historic use of 
this pit.  Although surface contamination from this pit was present, it was 
not  known whether subsurface soil and groundwater conditions underlying the 
Equilon assets had been impacted.

 Patterson Station 1-10,000 bbl floating roof steel product storage tank with 
fiberglass bottom, installation date 1981, one propane driven waukesha F817GU 
engine horsepower unknown,  

1. Clean Air Act.  There were no records kept at any office or location which 
would assist in the determination of compliance with Title III, or Title V or 
the  construction permit notification process administered by the Colorado 
Department of Public Health and Environment.  The  following documents were 
not  present:  emissions inventories and or records of fees paid, O&G MACT 
compliance (HAP's),  operating or construction permits.  NSPS subpart Kb   
compliance could not be determined.   Determination of the permitting status 
for the six cylinder Waukesha could not be determined. 

2. Clean Water Act.  Although soil berm and containments were present, an 
SPCC plan was not available at this location.  Interviews with the Equilon   
personnel stated that there had never been a reportable release from this 
tank.  Rainwater which collected into the containment was discharged into an  
ephermal arroyo by a pipe constructed into and through the dirt containment.

3. NORMS.  A NORM survey has not been conducted on any portion of the assets 
which are identified in the bid package.

4. Minor soil staining was present around the 10,000 bbl tank.

5. Adjacent to this site was a producer site which had been blowing  
hydrocarbon liquids into an earthern unlined pit.  There was historic use of 
this pit.   Although surface contamination from this pit was present, it was 
not known whether subsurface soil and groundwater conditions underlying the   
Equilon assets had been impacted.

Patterson Junction  1-10,000 bbl floating roof steel product storage tank 
with fiberglass bottom installation date 1987. Electrical pumps were present 
to transfer liquids from the 10,000 bbl tank to the truck loading facilities. 

1. Clean Air Act.  There were no records kept at any office or location which 
would assist in the determination of compliance with Title III, or Title V or 
the  construction permit notification process administered by the Colorado 
Department of Public Health and Environment.  The  following documents were 
not  present:  emissions inventories and or records of fees paid, O&G MACT 
compliance (HAP's),  operating or construction permits.  NSPS subpart Kb   
compliance could not be determined.   Determination of the permitting status 
for the six cylinder Waukesha could not be determined. 

2. Clean Water Act.  Although soil berm and containments were present, an 
SPCC plan was not available at this location.  Interviews with the Equilon   
personnel stated that there had never been a reportable release from this 
tank.  Rainwater which collected into the containment was discharged into an  
ephermal arroyo by a pipe constructed into and through the dirt containment.

3. NORMS.  A NORM survey has not been conducted on any portion of the assets 
which are identified in the bid package.

4. Minor soil staining was present around the 10,000 bbl tank and transfer 
pumps.

5. A small bucket had been placed into the ground, below ground surface to 
collect liquids from meter.  


Cortez Office.  In the office yard, several environmental issues were present 
and are listed as follows:

 old spent 12 volt batteries
 empty drums
 open buckets containing oil and oilfield sludge

The  pipeline stream crossing at the Montezuma Creek  showed the pipeline to 
be exposed in the bottom of the creek for a distance of approx. 12 feet.  
There were block valves on the upstream and downstream segments of this 
crossing.

 














and the equipment in the Cortez office building.

"Re: Sun Devil - Helicopter Fly-Over of Routes","John, I plan on grabbing not only a digital camera but also my video camera 
to handle the panarama part of the equations.  In conversations with Doug 
Cebryk, it looks like the primary routes are Interstate 17 and El Paso's 
existing right of way south.  I spoke with Kevin Hyatt about a possible route 
that exists south to a power plant between station 1 and Kingman Az, and then 
heading southeast into the Phoenix area, but didnt know if the economics 
would work out. Ive got ENSR looking at other routes that might hold 
promise.  I also plan on addressing what might be considered sensitive areas 
of potential impact (streams, rivers, riparian habitat, difficult terrain, 
population and  critical habitat  issues etc)  Ill have a report to you 
shortly after the trip...

Subject: Sun Devil - Helicopter Fly-Over of Routes


	

Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the ""fatal-flaw"" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events 
coordinated.  John Shafer

"SoCal Meeting with Southwest Gas","I wanted to let everyone know that the meeting between Southwest Gas and 
SoCal concerning presence of PCBs on the Southwest Gas system will be this 
tuesday.  I had an opportunity to speak with Ralph Komai today during the PCB 
quarterly management conference call  that Transwestern has with SoCal to 
discuss PCB related invoices.  As a brief summary, Southwest has had isolated 
hits of PCB in liquids (232 and 132 ppm) and in wipe tests (10-100 ug/wipe)  
in regulators on their system and they have asked Ralph if he would assist 
them in the management and disposal of PCBs on their system.  He wil also be 
providing thoughts on how and why PCBs move in a gas pipeline.

I had asked Ralph not to mention about Transwestern's agreement with SoCal 
for which Transwestern pays SoCal for 86% of their PCB costs.  I had asked 
him to only focus on the Southwest system.  Apparently Southwest is not up to 
speed with the PCB regualtions, however, enough so that they do realize that 
the mega rule will impact their operations and Ralph will probably provide 
input for that as well from an LDC standpoint. 

I asked Ralph whether Southwest seemed excited or worried about the PCB 
discovery on their system and he indicated that they were more concerned 
about compliance with the PCB regulations.  Ralph said he will let me know 
the results of the meeting.

Subject: RE: mea culpa



  Public Statement by the Rev. Jesse Jackson

  Due to the great consternation caused by the
  revelation of my act of procreation, I accept my
  obligation to give an explanation to the
  population for my act of copulation.

  I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of
  sexual gratification, that I could not obtain through
  masturbation, resulted in my fornication.
   I accepted her invitation, and provided her with
  excitation, stimulation, penetration, replication, and
  liberation.

  She provided lubrication (to avoid inflammation) and I
  wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried  for
  duplication but I insisted upon
  termination, in spite of her fascination with
  variation.

  This has caused me great aggravation, and the
  agitation and provocation of the media has resulted in
  my humiliation, denigration, and
  degradation. My wife is considering castration, which
  would require my hospitalization.

  Pray that this matter will find culmination in my
  sanctification and rehabilitation so that my plans for
  nomination to my ultimate vocation will not result in
  revocation and termination.I hope this proclamation
  has provided illumination and verification and will
  prohibit further provocation (or investigation).

  Sincerely,
  The Rev. Jesse Jackson

"Additional Noters on SoCals Meeting with Southwest Gas over PCBs","I spoke with Ralph Komai, PCB person with SoCal, concerning the SWG meeting 
about PBCs on the SWG system.  As mentioned in the last note, SWG has 
discovered PCBs and has been sampling to determine extent and movement into 
their system.  SWG receives gas from SoCal and PGE at two separate and 
independent interconnects.  Liquids have been collected at the two 
interconnects from SoCal at concentrations of <500 and <100 ppm, 
respectively.  They have taken approx. 100 wipe samples and have had ""hits"" 
but nothing over 100 ug per wipe.   

In the meeting, SWG has expressed aggressive interest to SoCal about the 
installation of filter separators at the SoCal/SWG interconnects.  They felt 
that the installation of separators would greatly benefit the reduction of 
PCBs into their system.  Becasue of this, Ralph stated that SWG would be 
sending him a proposal for the installation of separators at the two 
interconnect locations.  I gave Ralph Earl Chanleys phone number as he was 
involved in the separator construction project last summer with PG&E.

"Transwestern's comments to rough drafts of permit for Klagetoh and Leupp","Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits 
which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.  The most 
critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really 
restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines.  
We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.  Let me 
know what additional information you may need. 


1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest
Operations.

2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based
on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.  At 60F
and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all
operating conditions.  However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as 
high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.

The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of
the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20%
of the time.  TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of
reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.  The potential
to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of
lb/hr and ton/yr.  These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA
for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA
Statement of Basis document). Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd
values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that
under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the
emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is
requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows
emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that
the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.

3. The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires
Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not
normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas.
Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel
monitoring schedules to use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or
gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the
natural gas.

"Arizona Mainline Expansion","This is a gentle reminder, and Im sure that most are aware, but under no 
circumstances is there to be any construction activiy initiated for the 
turbine installation at the four mainline compressor stations, until the air 
construction permits are issued by the applicable air agency.  Construction 
activity is defined, but is not limited to roads, trenching activity, 
buildings, electrical poles etc.  The state and federal agencies take a very 
dim view on initiating any attempts to initiate construction prior to 
approval.  This approval is considered to be the air permit authorizing 
construction of the proposed activity.  Your assistance in this compliance 
issue will be greatly apprecaited.   Data generation and agency consultations 
are now in progress to expidite the permit submittals.  Should you need 
further clarification, give me a call (505) 625-8022 or via e-mail.

"Additonal PCB Sampling on the SoCal System","During the quarterly conference call with SoCal in which we discuss PCB costs 
on the SoCal system, for which Transwesten is 86% responsible, Ralph Komai, 
SoCal's PCB person provded some addtional information with respect to what is 
going on with the PCB activities on the SoCal system.  As a result of the 
PG&E press release, SoCal management directed additional sampling to be done 
at their interconnect with Transwestern and downstream of this interconnect.  
Ralph reported that a number of liquid samples came back at around 7 ppm, 
however one sample at their Kelso Station, near Barstow,  came back at 77 
ppm. 

Ralph had indicated that there has been an increase in the PCB's coming into 
their collection locations in the Needles area as evidenced by the following:

 Based upon 1997 data, almost no liquids greater than 50 ppm were revcovered

 Data collected in 1998 showed that approx. 8% of the liquids were greater 
than 50 ppm

 Data collected in 1999 showed that approx. 9% of the liquids were greater 
than 50 ppm

Based upon this, Ralph had stated that SoCal would be collecting additional 
sampling information and possibly entering into an internal montoring 
program, somewhat like PG&E is currently doing now.

I had informed Ralph that our Needles M/S facility had seen almost no liquids 
in the last 5 years, other than a recent accumulation of a one time pigging 
in early 2000 when a small volume of liquids (less than 55 gallons) had been 
collected.   We discussed that the accumulations seen on the SoCal system 
were probably from existing liquids on their system which had collected in 
low points in their pipeline and were moving downstream due to the increased 
flows from TW into SoCal.  

Ralph gave the impression that there were no immediate management tensions 
resulting from the recent ""hits"".  He just indicated that they would be 
watching their system and sampling at a more frequent basis.

not the culprits is this activity.  I have a problem conducting an ongoing 
sampling for an issue that were not responsible for, even though we initiated 
the sampling activity.  I plan on visiting the OCD about this issue and 
either forcing them to justify why we should continue the sampling when the 
data points to our neighbors.  Additionally, because of the turnover and 
inability to get the guilty party to get moving on this, spending additional 
money and not receiving any return seems like a waste of time.  Thoughts....

Subject: NNG Eunice Station

The last groundwater sampling event at the Eunice Station was completed in 
August 1997. Subsequently, the OCD approved our revised sampling plan that 
calls for biennial sampling. In light of this we were due to sample this past 
August. I held off on sampling in hope that Texaco would soon assume this 
responsibility, however, since it does not appear that this is going to occur 
anytime soon enough I will schedule a sampling event within the next four 
weeks. Since there are only six monitor wells to sample at this site, 
sampling can be completed in one day by one person at a cost of about $2500 
(including expenses and lab costs).

"RE: Red Rock Air Permits Heads up!","John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and 
would like to make sure everyone has the facts why  Transwestern was unaware 
of the delay in the agencies issance of the air permits.  I had met with each 
agency prior to submitting each application (February of this year) to ensure 
that each application contained the correct and proper information required 
by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we would need the 
permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September 
permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that energy 
issues related to California were to be given top priority.   On a monthly 
basis I phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application to be kept 
aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, 
both agencies assured me that the permits were progressing on schedule and no 
delays were expected .  As we approached the anticipated September issuance 
date, calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I was 
first informed of the 1-4 month additional time beyond the September issuance 
which would be required for the permit issuance. 

In light of this issue, we in ETS might want to use this as a training 
exercise and develop a protocol that the other DES's should apply to stay on 
track with the permit progress for construction projects.

Subject: RE: Red Rock Air Permits Heads up!

Phil,
I agree with your assessment, but would offer some additional information.; 
After returning from Austin on Wednesday and learning that Larry Campbell 
had;received a negative reaction from EPA Region IX concerning a possible 
meeting with them, I worked on this issue most of Thursday and Friday.; The 
strategy I discussed with Lou was to locate a local Arizona or California 
""political/lawyer"" type;who would have the necessary contacts to get us in 
there and get the permits moving.; Lou agreed and we have been working on 
that strategy while gathering more information related to the ""right"" contact 
that could get this job done.; I personally have had lengthy discussions 
(Thursday and Friday) with Lou, Larry Campbell, Bill Kendrick and several key 
consultants that have extensive contacts within both Arizona and 
California.;We are closing in on a;local law firm and also a ""high level;air 
consultant"";who will be able to get us in at the Director or Air Permit Chief 
level;to present (1) our;situation, (2) clean air needs for Arizona and CA, 
and (3) how long these permits have already been on file.; We should have 
someone identified early this next week.; 
;
Let me present the following information to;complement yours:
* ;The permitting timeline;being used;was based on historical 
timelines;encountered;while processing prior Arizona projects.; No indication 
of backlogs or slower processing in the beginning.; A familiar consultant 
(Argent);was used for the air permit applications and no indication was 
offered by the AZ DEQ or EPA Region IX that normal processing was not 
occurring.; Applications filed in March, 2001 and by letter from the agencies 
were deemed complete by mid-April.
* Within the last two weeks, the Arizona DEQ Permit Engineer assigned to the 
applications for Station 1 and 2 has stated that he is overloaded and working 
on the applications as they are in the ""que"".; He told Larry Campbell (and I 
have verified;it also by talking to outside consultants that permit in 
Arizona) that this is true and the AZ DEQ have been very slow lately in 
getting permits out. (Caveat: One of the suggestions we want to carry in to 
AZ DEQ is that we would be willing to pay for a third-party contractor to 
take the permits and work them up;for release to the publishing firm so they 
can be sent out for public comment.; AZ DEQ is willing to meet with us and 
discuss our applications.);; Even if we get this part going, this is only 
part of the problem.; Bottom line is;we must play our cards;correctly at this 
juncture to be able to get our applications moved up in the que, typed, and 
out for public comment; but EPA Region IX will still have thirty days after 
that for their review of those two state issued permits.
* EPA Region IX is a different story.; It is most difficult to put pressure 
on them, more so than AZ DEQ.; The applications for Stations 3 and 4 are on 
tribal land and these;applications are not delegated to any state air quality 
department.;;After the technical meetings in the office last week, Larry made 
a couple of calls;to the Permit Engineer;in Region IX and received a negative 
response.; Larry was told that the;permits would issue in one to four months 
and that;there was no need for a meeting with them.; Again,;my advice at this 
point is to find the right person with the right contacts at a very high 
level and get the meeting set.; It's one thing to pressure the State of 
Arizona and get a permit applications moving; but if we are not very careful 
with Region IX we could damage our ability to not only get Sun Devil's 
permits, but create audits and compliance situations that are far reaching.; 
Again, we must first get a personal meeting with them;to enable us to 
present;the need, circumstances, and how long these permits have already been 
on file.; Locating the;correct person to help us do that is of upmost 
importance!
* Clarifying the complicated point, EPA Region IX has responsibility 
to;review and publish not only the permits for Stations 3 and 4, but to also 
review the AZ DEQ permits for stations 1 and;2 for 30 days.; Therefore, if we 
anger EPA Region IX over permits for Stations;3 and 4, they could delay the 
issuance of the permits for Stations 1 and 2 that;have been expedited with 
the AZ DEQ.; It's a two-edged sword.
Our Strategy:
* Continue to work on the technical staff permit engineers, but very 
carefully.; Indications are that our phone calls are beginning to annoy them.
* Locate a political/lawyer type that has connections at the top of AZ DEQ 
and EPA Region IX to help us get the;desired meeting with key;people in order 
to;move;the permits.; This should be done within the next week.
* Offer to assist in any manner (e.g., funding a third party) to get the 
permit applications moving out of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX for public comment.
I have some strategic ideas that will increase the;probability that this type 
of circumstance will not occur in the future.; I will be glad to discuss any 
of this with you on Monday morning.; John Shafer

At Stan,s staff meeting last week, the discovery of a delay in the issuance 
of Air Permits was discussed.; Stan indicated that this was unacceptable.; I 
requested that you conduct a meeting that afternoon with key people to 
outline a plan of attack to get the permit schedule back on track.; I am 
aware that you did such and you provided a voice mail update that indicated a 
plan.
;
Here is the problem.; Apparently the matter was further discussed at the 
weekly Red Rock status meeting on Friday and the following feedback was 
provided by a &little birdie8.; We can expect another unpleasant discussion 
at Monday,s 8am meeting with Stan.
;
* Joe Hartsoe has been unable to pursue any discussion with Washington 
officials to put pressure on Arizona.; WTC attacks! 
* Operations is unwilling to put much pressure on Arizona/EPA out of concern 
for future responsiveness from the agency Re: Sun Devil 
* Sun Devil is a bird in the bush and Red Rock is a bird in the hand. 
* There is no way that we can get the Red Rock project completed as promised 
because we waited until it was too late to find out what was going on with 
the Air Permits. 
* The agency will not allow a bifurcation of the project and let us proceed 
with on site construction prior to a permit and delay delivery of the 
compressor to the site. 
* We haven,t yet had any contact with the agency after the discussion last 
Monday.

"Due Diligence Northwest Natural Gas Company-Summary","As per your request, an environmental due diligence was completed of the 
assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWNG), a 
local distribution company  (LDC), with its corporate headquarters located in 
Portand, Oregon.  This  due diligence, which was conducted on August 7-9, 
2001,  was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures 
which may be associated with  NWNG and identify and evaluate the 
environmental risks associated with each issue.  A relative risk number 
between 0 and 3 has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential 
risk impact.  A rating of ""0"" indicates that there is no risk associated with 
this regulation or issue and a rating of ""3"" indicates a major problem or an 
issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure.  An approximate cost  
value has also been assigned to each discipline.   It is to be understood and 
explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost, conservative 
estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair, remediate or 
formally close each issue. 

Presented below, by discipline, are the environmental activities which impact 
and affect NWNG.  The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is 
based upon the availability of records, documents and discussions with NWNG 
personnel.  Therefore, this summary report is limited to the availability of 
information presented.

General Pipeline Characteristics ;

This is a dry pipeline system.  No pipeline liquids are generated, only small 
volumes of compressor oils are collected.
All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system.  There is still approx. 
100 miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future.  
The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage, 
and underground injection and storage reservoir (10.5 bcf storage capacity). 
this is a non Title V major source.
NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their 
underground storage capacity. 
NWNG is planning a 60 mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of 
2002.  All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the 
agencies.
Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern.  NWNG has 
completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas.    

Environmental Procedures Manual.   The NWNG environmental procedures manual  
appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format.  The topics 
covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company 
appeared to be involved with.  The manual addressed waste management, 
permitting,  disposal and environmetal stewardship.  There was also a written 
statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNG's commitment to 
enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG. 
Risk: 0  Cost: $0

Notices of Violation (NOV)/Notices of Noncompliance (NON).   In a summary 
page provided by NWNG, a list of all state and federal agency actions against 
the company was available.  Although the company had received a few  notices 
(<10), they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small 
recordkeeping and right of way issues.  There were no outstanding judgements, 
NOVs, NONs or pending agency actions or  issues to be resoved.  
Risk: 0  Cost: $0 

PCBs.  In interviews with NWNG, they attested to the fact that they have 
never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected.  
Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company, 
the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system  was unknown.
Risk:  1  Cost: $0        

Mercury.   Mercury was used on the NWNG system, but only in monometers and 
not in natural gas metering equipment.  A decision was made by environmental 
management of NWNG in 1986-87 to remove mercury manometers.  An investigation 
has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers 
or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment 
which may have been used. 
Risk:  1  Cost:  $3,000-$40,000

Onsite Disposal.  Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas 
plants, in interviews with NWNG's environmental management, they were not 
aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous, toxic or non hazardous 
waste.
Risk:   1  Cost:   undefined

Hazardous Waste.  There is only one location where hazardous waste is 
generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is 
used.  This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity 
generator.  The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous 
waste.
Risk: 0  Cost:  0 

NORMS.  The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually 
occurring radioactive materials (NORMS) are not a problem in the pipeline 
system.  Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this, nor does 
NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest  Pipeline Company.
Risk:  1  Cost:  $500

Underground Storage Tanks (UST).  There is only one regulated underground 
storage tank (UST) remaining on the NWNG system (Albany), and this tank is in 
complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring, testing and 
recordkeeping.  All other underground tanks have been removed.  At one of the 
tank removal sites, there exists  an active remediation in progress.  Closure 
of this site is expected in the near future.
Risk: 1  Cost: $500

LNG plants.  In interviews with NWNG environmental management, there are no 
histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural 
gas (LNG)  plants.  The exception to this is a historic site of a 
manufactured gas plant (Linnton site) which underlies the LNG plant.  This 
issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas 
Plant. 
Risk: 0  Cost:  $0

Manufactured Gas Plants.  NWNG owned and operated  a number of manufactured 
gas plants (MGPs).  Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had 
operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks.

 Eugene Water and Electrical Board. The City of Eugene has determined that  a 
parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by   numerous 
responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time 
period of 1958-1976.  The Eugene Water and Electrical Board  (EWEB), which is 
the regulatory agency in Eugene,  has determined that the total cost to clean 
the entire area will be approximately $1,300,000, of which  the EWEB has 
indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be $93,750.  NWNG has offered to pay 
compensation damages in the amount of $70,000-90,000 to  be relaesed from all 
liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City 
of Eugene.   The environmental management of NWNG  has stated that the EWEB 
has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG  offer of approximately 
$94,000.
 Risk: 1-2 Cost:  $94,000

 Salem Site. According to NWNG management, this historic MGP site has been 
remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem, which is the   
regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site.  NWNG has received 
endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature.  
 Risk: 1   Cost: $0

 Manufactured Gas Plant. This site, which ceased operation in the early 
1900's, was dismantled and  abandoned.  From the time the facility ceased  
operations, untill the present, a railroad has constructed a steel rail 
bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park.  
The site is  immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River, a major perennial 
watercourse in Oregon.  There have been no soil, groundwater or river/ river 
sediment   studies  completed  to determine potential environmental impacts.  
NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds 
of  London.  The insurance policies were not available at the time of this 
due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this 
site.
 Risks: 2-3 Costs: 0-$300,000,000

Portland Harbor Superfund Site.  The Environmetnal Protection Agency has 
determined that the Portland Harbor, on the Wilammette River,  has received 
contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify 
the 6.7 miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site.  This superfund site extends 
for a distance of 6.7 miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites, 
originally owned by NWNG.  The EPA has designated approximately 69 primary 
responsible parties  which are directly or indirectly involved in the 
contamination of this section of the Willamette River.  NWNG has been 
identified as a contributing member to the contamination.

 Linnton MGP/Wacker Site.   The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site, has 47 acres of 
water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the  Portland 
Harbor Superfund Site.  The Linnton facility, which originally included the 
Wacker Site,  initiated operation in 1913 and ceased operation in 1956.   
During the operation of the  facility operation,  various organic coal tar 
wastes, comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) and dense non  
aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) were generated.  Characteristically these 
waste products include: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), BTEX  and 
cyanide.  During the early stages of facility operation, these wastes  were 
originally directly deposited into the Willammette River, and then later, in  
1941 unlined ponds were constructed at the facility.  Preliminary 
investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility 
operations which  were released either directly or indirectly into the soil 
underlying the facility or into the Wilamette  River were in excess of 4.6 
million gallons or 23,000 cubic  yards.   It was also estimated from these 
reports that there is approximately 250,000 cubic yards of tar and tar mixed 
with soil underlying the historic tar  ponds.  

 Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to 20 or more 
years.  NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of 
London   which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNG's portion 
of this superfund responsibility.  The policies were not availble during the 
due diligence  to verify or confirm the amount of coverage.  Additionally, 
because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the 
subsurface soil,   groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not 
been determined, it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be 
evaluated.   It  should also be mentioned that because the proportionate 
extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known, adequate insurance 
coverage  appears to be somewhat premature. 
 Risk:  3  Cost:  $50,000,000-300,000,000

"Natrual Gas Release Reporting Requirements for Texas","As a reminder, the state of Texas requires releases of natural gas greater 
than 119 mscf  to the atmosphere (in a 24 hour period), to be reported to the 
Regional Offices of the TNRCC.  These releases include but may not be limited 
to the following:  ESD's, startups, shutdowns, pipeline ruptures and 
maintenance activities.  Should any of the above activities release natural 
gas in excess of 119 mscf, a written notification should be faxed to the 
Regional Office of the TNRCC  within the following timeframes:

 Unanticipated Upsets- within 24 hours after the discovery of the upset. 

 Maintenance, Startup or Shutdowns- 10 day prior to the expected exceedance.

This reminder is being sent to all ET&S teams within Texas because in the 
last two Northern Natural Gas compressor station inspections conducted by the 
TNRCC,  they specifically requested backup data and reporting documentation 
of the natural gas releases to the atmosphere which were greater than 119 
mscf.  The agency's  inquiry specifically addressed knowledge of compressor 
station venting for ESD, start ups and shutdowns.

It should also be mentioned that there has been inconsistencies in the 
TNRCC's position regarding this issue.  However, until a position has been 
adopted by Enron's GPG, I am recommending that each facility comply and 
report as appropriate.

The fax numbers for the following Regional offices are as follows:

 Midland (915)  570-4795    Included facilities-  Wt-2, Walton, Keystone, 
Lone Star Valero, Spraberry, Seminole

 Lubbock (806)  796-7107  Included facilities-  P-2, Plainview, Brownfield

 San Angelo (915)  658-5431  Included facilities- Reagan Co. 2, Irion Co. 1, 
Eldorado

Reporting forms for the release can be faxed to your location by request by 
contacting me at (505) 625-8022.

"Re: LaPlata","  Bill, we had an air inspection at the facility a couple of weeks ago and 
all went well.  Prior to the state visit, we went through a ""trouble 
shooting"" scenario and found out that Solar provided us with innacurate 
permitting information for that altitude and temperature.  Solar was very 
helpful and provided us with updated information to reflect conditions at the 
facility.  I submitted a permit revision and it was submitted to the state of 
Colorado prior to their inspection, requesting more fuel but no more 
emissions.  Recent testing has shown that even under extreme low 
temperatures, the emissions are under the original permitted levels.  Because 
we did not request additional emissions, I expect the permit to be issued 
within the next couple of months..... bottom line is that no NOV will be 
issued for the fuel use issue.

"RE: Status of Martin co. NO. 1","Midland Team, the Martin Co. No. 1 facility is potentially in non compliance 
because there is new emissions data from the EPA which shows the units at 
this facility  emit emissions which would trigger a Title V air permit.  
Steve San Miguel and Stoney tried to conduct an emissions test  with a 
portable analyzer but were unable to collect representative emissions data 
due to the fact that the unit was in very poor mechanical shape and showed 
very high emissions.  We have a couple of options.  Spend the $$$$ necessary 
to bring the unit up to standards that allow a representative emissions test 
to be conducted and determine whether the emissions from the units trigger 
permit action or use the new EPA data and submit an air permit application.  
The choice is yours.  Understand, this permit if issued, places some 
recordkeeping and mechanical responsibilities on the Midland team.  Let me 
know what you would like to do.

Subject: TW Laguna Station Remediation

On Wednesday, October 20th, I contacted Ms. Barbara Bernacik at the Office of 
the Pueblo of Laguna, Division of Environment. I contacted Ms. Bernacik at 
the suggestion of Norm Gonzales (TW Laguna Team) to discuss outstanding 
environmental issues at the Station. 

In a conversation with Norm the previous week, Norm indicated to me that he 
had met with Ms. Bernacik and Ray Lucero (Engineer, Pueblo of Laguna) 
recently in regards to backfilling an open excavation which had been 
excavated in 1993 when a diesel UST was removed from the site. The excavation 
had not been backfilled pending authorization from the Pueblo of Laguna. This 
and other outstanding issues were discussed in a meeting with Ray Lucero, the 
Governor of the Pueblo of Laguna, Ted Ryther, Larry Campbell, Butch Russell, 
and myself back in 1995 but there was no resolution of the issues, primarily 
because at the time the Laguna's did not have an environmental staff person 
to address such issues. Subsequently, Ms. Bernacik was hired as the Laguna's 
environmental staff person about two years ago. 

In the course of Norm's conversation with Ms. Bernacik and Mr. Lucero, Mr. 
Lucero indicated some concern that the Pueblo of Laguna had not been kept 
apprised of environmental issues at the Station. In light of this, I have 
prepared a ""Report of Groundwater Monitoring Activities"". This report covers 
monitoring activities between June 1994 and June 1999. As previously 
mentioned, I also contacted Ms. Bernacik for the purpose of introducing 
myself and to inform her that a report has been prepared and will be 
delivered to her office. I also suggested that we meet at the site to discuss 
outstanding environmental issues. The response from Ms. Bernacik was very 
favorable and we agreed to meet at the site at 10:00 am November 16th. Ms. 
Bernacik also indicated that someone from the BIA will be with her.

The following is the update I received from the Kingman Team on todays 
pigging activities:

Tiny,
 We kicked two pigs today with 55 gals of diesel in front of each pig.  On 
the first run we got only enough liquid to get a sample.  The pig came out 
with a big chunk out of it.  Don't know what is causing this because we have 
received a couple of pigs that were damaged.  This is only the second pig 
that has come in that we cannot use again.   
 When the second pig came in, we received 41 gals of liquid.  We had to haul 
it out a pail at a time.  We pulled about half from the seperator and half 
from the drain tap in front of the seperator.
 These two runs took us nine hours to run, that is why we only did two.  We 
plan on putting in 100 gals of diesel tomarrow since they are going to ship 
some more diesel for us on Monday.  If flow rate permitting we plan on 
kicking two more pigs tomarrow with 100 gals each.

Brent  & Russ

Per this evenings discussions with Gas Control, it looks like we will have 60 
mmcfd scheduled to PG&E for tomorrows (Sundays) gas day.  Gas Control will 
make every effort to coordinate flows with PG&E and insure we have higher 
flowing volumes during the pigging hours if at all possible.  Again the new 
pigs are due to be on site by Tuesday.   I forwarded an e:mail message to 
Kingman informing them to insure they split a sample with PG&E on the 15 MP 
sample point.  

I've set up a conf. call for this Friday the 13th at 10:00 am Houston time.  
We should have additional sampling infromation by this time not only from the 
Weekly Report but on the pigging activites as well.  (877-795-3687   pin 
323297)

Hope you had a better flight home than me - late one hour departing, flew to 
Omaha and circled because of lightning and thunderstorms until we had to go 
to Kansas City for fuel, then back to Omaha to sneak in between lightning 
bolts - the drive home was a combination of being blinded by lightning, 
unable to see because of driving rain, or praying the car could make it 
through the flooded streets! Anyway, home by 1:15 AM, so not too bad.

Here's what I believe to be our current plan, which will be communicated to 
PG&E through letter to Rod Boschee.

1.  Continue to inject diesel at a 55 gal rate and pig daily through 8/15
We will be running from 2 to 4 pigs daily (depending on flow rates) and 
injecting 100 gallon per pig run.  Today (Saturday) was the exception because 
of flow rates and the volume of diesel on hand (400 gn's).  Two pigs were run 
at 55 gallons of diesel per pig.  This 400 gallons under the previous pigging 
schedule would have lasted for 1 1/2 weeks at the single pig per day & at 55 
gallons per pig.  A load of diesel will be on location Monday.   

2.  Collect liquids from all pig runs for analysis and trending (daily or as 
often as pigs are received)

3.  Collect liquids from TW's filter / separator for analysis and trending 
(daily)
This is above and beyond the weekly accumulation and split sampling at this 
point.  The Weekly Split sampling will still continue.  

4.  After 8/15, continue pigging daily w/o injection of any liquids to dry 
pipe through 9/7

5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above

6. Schedule Vector to be on site September 7 to decontaminate a.) 1850' of 
pipe from TW's measurement to PG&E's filter/separator and b.)  PG&E's 
filter/separator.  
Larry/Earl - We're still OK on clearances for ROW and excavation etc... 
should we need to make a cut into the 1850' of pipe aren't we?  I'm assuming 
the clearances we received for the siphon project would carry forward????

7. Post 5 day outage for scheduled pipeline maintenance on EBB as soon as 
Vector confirms date.

8. Trending and analysis will determine if any pigging or further decon work 
will be done on TW's upstream pipe.

Please review, add, subtract, correct, etc. prior to Monday. Thanks for 
continuing help - this is going to be a very tough win, if a win is possible. 
Mike

is the correspondance concerning the reqeust to replace the mixing valves 
with carbuerators at the Northern Natural Gas, Spraberry Plant.   The players 
in this activity included Jon Fields of Argent Consulting.  Due to the fact 
that the pre testing data for the emissions from the mixing valves and the 
post testing data for emissions from the carbuerators were received in hard 
copy only, I am not able to provide this as an attachment.  This data was, 
however, sent to you via fed-x on January 24, 2001.  If needed, I can 
resubmit the results of the data for your review.   As expected, the 
emissions levels did decrease when the carbs were installed. 

Please reveiw the attached correspondance concerning the request to replace 
the mixing valves at the Spraberry Plant (TNRCC account No. ML-0022-W) with 
carbuerators without requiring involvement of a permitting activity.  Thank 
you for your consideration in this issue.

Jon, Here's the latest comment from Jim:
don't see why a test before the change and after the change using the same
analyzer would not demonstrate no increase in emissions.

Duncan,
Ok.  We'll test an engine.  This project involves 5 identical engines.  We
want to test just one - will you accept that?  Will you accept portable
analyzer test results?  These analyzers have been certified by the state of
New Mexico to be plus/minus 3% from full trailer tests.
Thanks,

IF there is no increase in emissions, this is probably not a modification
and the Grandfathered status would remain.  They would need to demonstrate
that there is no change.  This could require testing before and after the
change.

Hi Jon,
This is a joint Duncan - Jim Linville reply.
First, for all intents and purposes, expect GF status to go away when the
legislature comes back to town.  With that in mind, what exactly is
happening with this engine.  Does the carburetor replace the mixer valves?
 If so, this must be one ancient engine!  And unlikely to get in under VERP
or any other program designed to end GF status.  Tell us more.
Duncan
>>> Jon Fields <jfields@argentinc.com> 08/22/00 11:05AM >>>
Duncan,
I have some grandfathered gas compressor engines in west Texas.  We are
going to change out the old mixer valves and install carburetors on the
units as a maintenance activity.  Horsepower and emissions will not
increase.  I can maintain my grandfathered status, correct?  We will of
course document this activity and provide copies to the regional office.
Thanks,
Jon Fields

"Rogas activity","Bill, things have pretty much quieted down on Rogas as compared to the last 
couple of weeks, but heres whats new:

A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to 
discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual 
reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit. 2) developing an 
agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed 
to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G. 3) Presentation of the 
results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the 
Rogas project.

The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was 
approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety 
Division.  There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by 
application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 
3 piplines.  This is the only agency approval received as yet.

Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas 
pipeline.  Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available 
for purchase.  It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating 
this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that 
EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary 
acreage for the Rogas project.  This is a major plus for the project.

Larry, per our phone conversation tonight.  I found this article interesting, 
especially in light of potential future expansions on TW.  Note the section 
below in bold Red text.  Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station 2 just 
across Interstate 40 and as you know, Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff 
off Interstate 15.  This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROW's 
but, it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving 
these areas.....   Anyhow, fyi...  (Oh yea, The Grand Canyon Trust & The 
Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building)  



New land pegged for preservation


By ANNE MINARD
Sun Staff Reporter
07/29/2001

  |
Reader Comments

It's been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly
rejected Proposition 100, a plan to protect 290,000
acres of State Trust Land from development.
And in about a month, voters could be asked to begin
signing petitions to get another initiative on the
ballot that would protect significantly more of the
state's legacy -- 1 million acres, or about 10 percent,
including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff.

The difference, conservationists say, is that this land
has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically
and aesthetically important areas. The environmental
community rallied against Prop. 100 because they said
the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and
had little value for conservation.

For example, the Proposition 100 campaign identified 10
acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff -- near a
wastewater treatment plant outflow -- as one of the
state's ""crown jewels"" needing to be preserved.

Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included 15
acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an
industrial park and 269 acres of steep slopes littered
with shot-up refrigerators and television sets called
Turkey Hills.

Rogers Lake, an important wetland and major ecosystem
south of Flagstaff, was also slated for preservation
under Prop 100. But that plan only included its soggy
lakebed, while 2,000 acres of highly developable
shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was
still up for grabs.

THE NEW PLAN

The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers
Lake, excluding those that are private or held by the
U.S. Forest Service. One proposed parcel does still fall
in the Turkey Hills area, and three others lie between
Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon (not included is
Section 20, which is likely to be sold and developed,
but at densities that are still in dispute between the
county and the city).

Other areas would include parcels around Observatory
Mesa (a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the
Naval Observatory) and a checkerboard pattern of
sections -- interspersed with Forest Service land --
south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and
Griffiths Spring.

Like Prop. 100, an initiative would be only a first
step. If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass,
it would take an act of Congress, and a constitutional
amendment, to change the availability of State Trust
Lands.

State Trust Lands include about 135 million acres across
the country -- 9.3 million in Arizona -- originally
allocated by the federal government when each state was
formed to help fund public schools. (See related story
on Page A11.)

Brad Ack, program director for the Flagstaff-based Grand
Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative,
said the state's schools shouldn't be bought and paid
for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl. Areas set aside
under the initiative could still be leased for grazing,
agriculture or other current uses -- but they would
never be sold for commercial development.

Making an informed decision to set aside designated
State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that
now accompany proposals to develop them, he said.

The initiative is a collaborative effort between the
Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups, along
with some business and development affiliates.

And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by
the Grand Canyon Trust, the Sonoran Institute in Tucson
and the Nature Conservancy that showed 88 percent of
Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizona's State Trust
Land should be conserved.

TALKING COMPENSATION

But members of the State Department of Lands charged
with managing the tracts -- and a lobbyist for
superintendents and principals in the state's school
system -- say the initiative backers are missing the
mark in the state land debate.

""We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our
friends in the environmental community,"" said Mike
Smith, a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School
Administrator Association. ""Preserve, set aside ... we
think those are great ideas. The question is
compensation. Those State Trust Lands are in trust for
the schools. It's acutely important for schools to
maximize the returns on state lands.""

Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is
new for the state's schools. Until recently, the schools
didn't see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts.

""We haven't seen any of it. The state Legislature has
taken the annual earnings, and has used it to reduce
state aid coming out of the general fund.""

That all changed with the passage of Proposition 301,
passed last year, he said.

""In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools ...
they also said, 'By the way, all new earnings from the
state trust fund go into the school site fund.' All of a
sudden, it's real different for us. Before it supplanted
our funding, now it will supplement it. It's real money
to us.""

The Legislature will still keep the money it has been
earning from State Trust Lands -- about $80 million a
year. But anything above that mark will now go to the
schools, and both Smith and Nick Simonetta, manager of
communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona
Department of Lands, are optimistic that figure will
climb rapidly in the coming years. Simonetta estimates
the schools could see $650 million in addition to
legislative appropriations over the next decade.

LOOKING BACK

But the past irregularities are a stronghold for
conservationists who are promoting the land reform
initiative.

In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform
Initiative, the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State
Trust Lands haven't been used as they were intended
anyway, and very little money has gone to Arizona
schools.

""State Trust Lands currently provide less than 2 percent
of the annual funding for public education,"" the
document reads. ""... there is little, if any, direct
benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools.""

Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that
assessment.

""I think those statements are severely misleading and
not reflective of what is currently the case. You can
throw around percentages any way you want. If you look
at what the trust has been contributing to the school
construction budget, it's more like 30 or 40 percent.""

Regardless, Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of
State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate
funds -- and won't be given away for free.

""It comes down to this: We are in intense discussion
with the conservation community,"" Smith said. ""Our
conversations are all around the question of
compensation. We are not going to support any initiative
that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without
compensation. You can take that non-support as far as
you like. If they attempt to go to Congress, we are
going with them.""

I am in the process re-negotiating PNM's FT on TW.  PNM has requested that TW 
continue to sample for contaminants at Rio Puerco, Belen and Ft. Wingate on a 
semi-annual basis during the term of the new contract which could be as long 
as five years out from 10/01.  Are we planning on continuing to sample these 
points in the East of Thoreau area?  Are there any objections to agreeing to 
this sampling?

"Weekly Environmetnal Activity Report","A presentation was given to the Transwestern Marketing Group in Houston over 
the PCB issues affecting sales of natural gas into western markets.  The 
history and future potential impacts of market stratgies were also discussed.

A training session on the Dehy MACT was attended in Santa Fe which was 
sponsored by the state of New Mexico, apprising companies of forth coming 
requirements under Title III.  A request will be sent out ot the field for 
each location which has dehydration to complete a extended gas analysis and 
rich lean glycol samples.  Notification to the staes and EPA is due by June 
17, 2000.

A conference call was attended to discuss the C/S 8 turbine project and its 
fate.  Based upon submitted discussions it was decided to dispose of the 
turbine, compressor and auxillary box as a PCB contaminated waste and move 
the contaminated articles to a PCB landfill.

The quarterly Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee mtg was held via 
conference call.  Invoices and charges were discussed which So
cal had charged to their management and handling of PCB's on their system.  
At 86%, Transwestern's responsibility was $71,208.61.

Clearances were received from the F&W and SHPO for the additional areas for 
the powerline transmission corridor of the Gallup C/S which is in progress.

A custom fuel monitoring request wqas submitted to Region VI EPA for the 
Transwestern Lone Star Valero C/S.

Installation and testing has been initiated on the precombustion chambers for 
the Superiors at the Atoka No. 3 C/S.   While fabrication is in progress for 
the correct chamber,  temporary Waukesha chambers were installed.  Even 
though the chambers were not of the correct size and configuration, a 12.5% 
fuel savings was achieved and emissions were reduced by over 56%.  The 
correct chambers will be available and installed sometime next week.

I think that I might have seen that face somewhere before, in fact that
could be one of our faces.  I found out last week that I didn't get drawn
for the deer/hog hunt that I have gone on the last two years.  Are you going
to take Ryan hunting?  If so when and where.  Right now Daniel is tied up
with being football manager and we don't get to do much.  Thanks for the air
force song that you sent, I got a big kick out of it.  I have been going to
a seminar call ""Making your children mind without loosing yours"" by a man
named Kevin Leman.  It has been really good and is Biblically based.  He has
a book out by the same name that I would highly recommend.

Later,
Randy

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMAPNY

A conference call was held with Region IX EPA to discuss Redrock Expansion 
issues related to the issuance of Title V air permits for Sat. 3 and 4 which 
are on Indain lands.  The agency provided a tentative date of 7 weeks before 
the the permits would be issued.  The EPA has required Transwestern to 
respond to issues related to the Endangered Species Act prior to issuance of 
the air permit.  Transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological 
assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 3 and 4.

A meeting was held with the Arizona DEQ to discuss what activities 
Transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the 
air permits for Station 1 and 2.  The agency gave a date of April 2002 as a 
normal issue date.  Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to 
be mid December of this year.  Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's 
management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased.  
On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction 
activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation 
construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant 
underground structures. This wil benefit the inbitiation of the Redrock 
construction prior to receivng the air permits for these stations.

"F&W Issue on the Navajo Lands","I spoke to John Nystedt, the contact person for the Navajo Nation F&W service 
concerning the need to do endangered plants and animal  surveys at the two 
C/S on reservation lands.  I had sent to him the USGS quad sheets of the C/S 
sites for review.  Today he stated that he didnt think surveys would be 
needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic 
disturbance at each location and that there was no sensitive habitiats in or 
near the C/S sites which would warrant surveys.  However, because of the 
issue of tribal lands, he was going to discuss this issue with the Navajo 
Nation director and verify his opinion and he would let Transwestern know on 
Monday of next week as to what the Tribes final decision would be, but he was 
almost sure that the Trib would recommend no surveys.  

John has faxed to me the list of approved botonists and boilogists which are 
approved to do work on the reservation.  I have contacted a number of 
individuals on the list and they are prepared to do the boilogical surveys 
next week  in the unlikely event a survey is required.

"Response to Redrock Air Permit Delay","John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and 
would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why  
Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air 
permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to 
ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information 
required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were 
expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a 
September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that 
energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I 
phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept 
aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, 
both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we 
approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were 
conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional 
time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else 
could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure 
that the permits would be issued in a timely manner.

"Re: NNG Eunice Station","George, after Bret's memo, go ahead and conduct the sampling.  the soonest I 
can discuss the issue with the OCD is in the middle of November.  I have 
reviewed the reports and results of the studies conducted by us and them and 
the evidence weighs in our favor.  At your leisure and prior to the November  
OCD meeting,  prepare a memo to file of the resaons and justification based 
upon the report results and data why Eunice is not the bad guy in this and 
why Texaco is.  Gradients,  plume elevations and characteristics of the 
contaminants show that this is not our problem.  Id like to have sufficient 
evidence, both mine and yours, to force OCD to go afterTexaco and  get us out 
of this issue.  

I think this would also help Bret's case for having Texaco (or whoever is 
responsible)  reimburse Northern  for the costs we have incurred for what is 
Texaco's problem.

Subject: NNG Eunice Station

The last groundwater sampling event at the Eunice Station was completed in 
August 1997. Subsequently, the OCD approved our revised sampling plan that 
calls for biennial sampling. In light of this we were due to sample this past 
August. I held off on sampling in hope that Texaco would soon assume this 
responsibility, however, since it does not appear that this is going to occur 
anytime soon enough I will schedule a sampling event within the next four 
weeks. Since there are only six monitor wells to sample at this site, 
sampling can be completed in one day by one person at a cost of about $2500 
(including expenses and lab costs).

"Re: The Draft of the PCB Cleanup Proposal","Mike,  I reveiwed the proposal by Adewumi and it is correct and fairly 
accurate, for the purposes of a historic account and and in as far as  what 
was provided to him in the way of data and history.  His proposed scope seems 
to be conclusive and appears to be what we need.   I have included Louie in 
the distribution  and am sure he will have some input. 

My comments are as follows:

1.  I dont know how relevant it is to know about the customers facilities at 
this time.  As you know, we have more than one customer (PG&E and SoCal), and 
I  think that we should maintain a low profile especially with respect ot 
SoCal.  Both parties in the past,  have been helpful and very cooperative in 
matters  pertaining to PCB's. Because the modeling study will be conducted 
between C/S 3 and C/S 2, the customers facilities should have no impact on 
this.  

2.  Also, I would like to see if we can deal with  PCB's and arsenic at the 
same time?  Is it possible to simultanously model both contaminants?

3. Because the modeling efforts are conducted on a very small portion of the 
pipeline, can this section be used for all of the Transwestern system?  In 
leau of  the fact that we have pipe under rivers, over rivers, major 
elevation chages in short distances etc which are not covered in the section 
to be modeled, will  the pipeline characteristics be covered to the extent 
that it will yeild information applicable to the entire pipeline system?

4. I am also concerned about stirring up the PCB's and moving additional 
PCB's into the SoCal system.  Its been pretty quiet  in discussions with the 
SoCal  PCB person.  I wonder if we should notify Ralph Komai to be on the 
alert when we start the cleaning?  Louie, thoughts?

5. Injection of terpenol into the station yard piping.  How will we do this 
and how do we get it out?

6. Impact of terpenol on gaskets, engine parts, etc.

Subject: The Draft of the PCB Cleanup Proposal



Dear Mike, David, Larry and Ben:
 Please find attached the draft of the PCB migration/cleanup proposal as
promised. This is only the technical portion of the proposal. Once we agree
on the specific scope of the work, the necessary man-hours and the
associated budget can then be developed.
 In addition, we have studied the material given during our meeting and have
developed a preliminary list of the data that we would need from you once
the project begins. I have decided to attach the list so as to give you
adequate time to collect and/or collate this information.
 Please give me your feedback on the proposal as soon as possible so that we
can develop the final version and submit an official proposal. Equally
important, the more preparation and planning we do at this stage, the faster
the progress that would be made once the project actually begins. Thank you
and have a wonderful weekend.

"Nitrogen and Sulfur reporting and Recordkeeping for Turbines","For those teams that have turbines installed after 1990 and/or for those 
turbines which have undergone power  unit changouts, the following 
recordkeeping and monitoring conditions apply:

1) DAILY recordkeeping of nitrogen and sulfur must be taken of the fuel gas 
which supplies the applicable turbine(s). 

2) This recordkeeping consists of electronic recording (gas chromtograph for 
nitrogen and  delmar or equivelant for sulfur) or stain tubes may also be 
used  for sulfur. These DAILY records include measurements on Saturdays and 
Sundays.

3) The measurement must be taken at the location.  An exception to this is 
that the nitrogen and sulfur measurements may be taken upstream or 
downstream  of the applicable turbine facility provided that there are no 
natural gas deliveries into the pipe which would interfere or dilute/increase 
the measurements  for the applicable turbine fuel gas. 

4) Fuel gas records in hard copy form or equivalent  for  the nitrogen and 
sulfur must be maintained at the facility or at a central location for easy 
retrival.  

5) A turbine facility may waiver out of this nitorgen and sulfur daily 
recordkeeping requirement by obtaining a custom fuel monitoring schedule 
(CFMS) from  the EPA.  Approval of a  CFMS allows a greatly reduced 
recordkeeping and reporting for nitrogen and sulfur.  CFMS requests have been 
submitted for the  following facilities:

   P-1 C/S
   Plains Turbine C/S
   Atoka No 2 C/S
   Monument C/S
   Crawford C/S
   Bloomfield C/S
 
Approvals have not as yet been obtained.  Until issuance of a CFMS, an 
applicable facility is required to continue daily sampling for nitrogen and 
sulfur.   
 
Facilities which have received CFMS from the EPA include:

   La Plata C/S
   P-2 C/S

Please be advised that there may be certain reporting requirements that might 
be required for each CFMS.  I would strongly advise that the La Plata and 
Panhandle  teams review their CFMS and include reporting dates into MCS, so 
that the deadlines and reportings are not missed. 

If you have a turbine facility which is subject to the nitrogen and sulfur 
reporting requirements and would like to reduce the reporting burden, contact 
Butch or myself.

"Redrock Permit Issue, Requested Information","Joe, presented below is the first memo I sent out concering the air permit 
issue:

[Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 
and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status 
of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.]

I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to 
another group (compliance) in the air permit section.  They strongly 
suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, 
Director of the ADEQ.  I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ 
compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back 
from her.  Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again, 
tomorrow.

Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to 
have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air 
permits:

 all earthwork
 trench construction and piping tie ins
 all foundation and building construction
 installation of ancillary equipment

This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may 
allow us to do.

The EPA contact for the Sta. 3 and 4 air permits: permit engineer  Roger 
Cohn      (415) 744-1238
      Supervisor  Geraldo Rios    (415) 744-1259

"Re: FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION ON THROUGHPUT AND OPERATING HOURS","Maria, as per your request, please see the attached data:

All the below figures were calculated using the 4500 hp factor on the 
mainline ( TCV-12 Clark ) units
and 450 hp on the ( 4520 Waukesha ) auxillary. Units 601, 602, and 603 are 
the mainline units. Unit 621 is the 
auxillary engine and runs back up power, if needed.  The year 1997 was 
figured by Kerry Welch who no longer is with us.  
1998, 1999, and 2000 operating hours and fuel use numbers were calculated 
using the spread sheet that was provided by our mechanical analyst.
 



Engine hours     601       602      603       621         Fuel Volume ( MM

17.01           29.82         105.55       1.39

The total throughput on condensate has been ( 0 gallons ) for 1997, 1998, 
1999, and 2000. This is due to the fact that our narutal gas supply changed 
in 1997 to a more dry natural gas and therefore, there was no liquids 
associated with the gas.

Again I apologize the inconsistency in the data.  We have had employee 
turnovers at the facility and different spreadsheets were used to provide the 
information to the EPA.  We are in the process of standardizing our data 
collections to eleminate this problem in the future.  I hope this information 
will help in the permit review process.  Again please accept my apologizes in 
the data collection errors.

Larry  - Sorry for the delay, but with PRC, life in HR has been pretty
intense.  I also made some initial contacts with the RMEF and have only
managed to play phone tag with the people I really needed to talk to.
Sounds like you've had better luck.

My approach was to look at a way to partner with the RMEF with their land
and habitat conservation programs on a national level rather than focusing
on any particular state.  Hopefully this would encourage broad based Enron
employee support and not foster any state biased partisanship.

Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation contact I tried is:

     Tony Schoonen
     VP Marketing
     Missoula, MT
     406/523-3432

Other Enron Employees I discussed this endeavor with and have indicated
their support are: Ken Crowl (Omaha), Virgil Pfennig (Iowa), & Ty McNeil
(Clifton, KS).

Others that might be interested are: Bob Besecker (Hugoton, KS), Roger Buck
(South Omaha), Andy Gieser (Omaha), Bill Sugg (Glasgow, MT), Ray Knox
(Clifton, KS), Joe Hill (Wolf Point, MT), Ron Omsberg (Mandan, ND), John
Nelson (North Branch, MN), Don Keller (Beatrice, NE), Larry Lottman
(Beatrice, NE), Steve Stedman (Beatrice, NE), Dale Johns (Palmyra, NE),
Kurt Weber (Beatrice, NE), Scott Finkbiner (Glasgow, MT), Bob Hopkins (Wolf
Point, MT), Roger Westfall (Omaha), & Jeff Boyce (Glen Ullin, ND).

All these are from my previous experience in North Operations.  As I
develop relationships as HR Rep for SE Operations, I am sure I will find
more interested employees.

Let me know what you think we should do from here.

Alert Posted: 4:25 PM October 7, 2000: Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pool :
South GA. VAldosta
Therefore, for Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., Valdosta primary pool
 will be under a Demand Mismatch Order.
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
This demand mismatch order carries a potential incentive charge of $30.00/dth 
for under deliveries to AGLC's system.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.
If you have any questions regarding the demand mismatch order, please call 
Brad Freeman at 404-584-4993, or Gas Operations at 404-584-4477.

show up as deliquent in his region.  Whatever you can do to assist us in 
either initiating the investigations or placing a hold on the drilling would 
be greatly appreciated.

"Re: Sta. 6 UST Excavation","George/Norm because there is no immediate concern or liability with the 
partially filled excavation, I want us wait for the official letter from the 
tribe before taking it upon ourselves to fill the excavation.  I dont want to 
send  a message to the Lagunas about us taking environmental matters into our 
own hands without involvement from the tribe.  If there is a reason to 
expidite the covering of this open area, then lets  send another  letter 
requesting to do so.  Given the other issues yet to be resolved at the 
station, lets keep the tribe involved and a part of our environmental 
activities.  I want to maintain a good working relationship with these 
people.  

As you may remember, they were a little irritated by Transwestern's neglect 
of not keeping them in the loop previously.  Lets not open that type of issue 
again......

Norm:
Per our telephone discussion this afternoon, I suggest you go ahead and 
backfill what remains of the open excavation that was created when the diesel 
UST was removed. A closure report was submitted to Ms. Bernacik of the Laguna 
Pueblo Environmental Department in January. We have not received a formal 
response from the Pueblo yet, but in a phone conversation, Ms. Bernacik 
indicated that they would have to take a closer look at the report before 
making a decision. Regardless, I don't think we need to wait on an approval 
of the closure report before backfilling the excavation. 
Thanks, George

"Re: Environmental -- NCL","Bill, Just a short note to let you know whats going on at Bakersfield.  I 
have spoken to the agency inspector about one of the NOV issues and have been 
told that EOTT will definately receive a an NOV and fine for failure to 
conduct the emissions testing on a heater that apparently should have been 
tested approx. 6 months ago.  With repsect to the other NOV issue, Rick 
Suderman had a testing company in to perform emissions testing on another 
heater which was required to be tested by today.  As the testing contractor 
began his testing, an 02 issue developed with the equipment the testing 
company was using and a miscommunication on the part of the testing 
contractor was directed to Rick.  As a result,  the  the inspector observed 
elevated CO readings from the heater that  Rick had made adjustments in the 
heater set points (based upon recommendations from the contractor) causing 
the elevated CO readings to result.  The inspector stated that the facility 
would receive another NOV for this exceedance.   In any event this isssue was 
NOT Rick's fault and was due to some bad communication on the part of the 
contractor.  We have sent the testing company home and will be bringing in 
another testing company (AEROS) on thursday.  This is the contractor who has 
done the majority of the previous emissions testing for the facility to 
complete the heater testing and substantiate the innaccuracy of the first 
testing company's data.  With this new data, we shold be able to demonstrate 
inaccuracy in the first testing company's QA/QC.

It should also be mentioned that we have identified other environmental 
issues which we should discuss at your convenience.  Butch and I will have 
completed the permit compliance investigataion and be available for 
discussions on friday.

Larry Campbell is going to Bakersfield this  week to address the situation.  
I have asked him to put together a compliance calendar for the Bakersfield 
facility outlining regulatory deadlines required by the permits and 
regulations.  He has discussed the testing due on one of the heaters this 
week with the regulators and there does not appear to be an issue.  It is my 
understanding that the heater will be performed this week.  Larry will look 
into the best course of action necessary to address the engine testing that 
was apparently missed last year.  He will be discussing the matter with 
Gary.   Please call with any questions.

     I just spoke with Gary Fuller who informed me that we have been
notified by the Air District that we are getting an NOV for missing a
source test in December (apparently on one of our IC engines.)  Now, while
this is not the end of the world, we put ourselves at potential risk if we
do not follow up properly -- especially given the history of this plant
with this Air District (that is, the Koch troubles that resulted in a
criminal investigation from some relatively minor problems, really.)

     In fact, I believe that if we act promptly and conduct the source test
now we stand a very good chance of having this NOV rescinded.  But we must
act.  I am please to see that we still have Gary on the job, and I hope he
can follow through with this.  I have asked him to do so, and also to
handle reporting of the soil contamination at NCL that we have all
discussed at length.  I have done so because delay works against us on both
of these issues.  Gary, though, is somewhat reluctant to act without
instruction directly from ETS (which is understandable, given that ETS runs
things.)   He seems to feel that he should be getting direction from Cutty
Cunningham, although I must confess I don't know enough yet about the
structure of ETS to know why this is the case.

     In any event, I asked Gary to talk to whomever he needed to, but these
matters needed to be handled in the short run.  Obviously, we will discuss
next week what is to be done for the long run.  In the meantime, I would
greatly appreciate whatever you folks can do to help grease the wheels to
make Gary feel he has authority to act to get these more immediate problems
addressed.  Thanks a bunch.

"Garcia Response of the Proposed Gallup C/S","With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia 
concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline 
Company offers the following response:

Pipeline Integrity.  With the construction of the evaporation ponds over 
Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored 
the potential for  impacts for the pipeline.  This includes a more frequent 
inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking 
potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present.  
Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the 
potential of pipeline corrosion.  As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has 
cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline 
coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the 
evaporation ponds.   The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern 
are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system 
at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also 
allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art 
monitoring and detection. 

Noise Issue.  In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern 
conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels.  
This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures 
which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso 
Station.  Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post 
noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above 
those levels mandated by FERC.  In the event of operational noise levels 
exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to 
performing any and all  mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post 
noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC.

Decrepancy of trailer park residents.  In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was 
stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the 
adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study, 
but ""more like 35 trailers"".  The number of mobile home residences currrently 
in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.  Transwestern's trailer park 
residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job 
market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low.  
The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job 
economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature 
of the residences.  It should also be noted that during the time that the 
trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the 
operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the 
operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments 
and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the 
trailer park residents.  It was actually noted that many of the spaces 
normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.  This unsanitary 
condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.  The 
NMED had implemented enforcement actions against the trailer park owner.

"","Mike I wanted to give a short update on the latest events related to the PCB 
issue with PG&E.  Transwestern met with PG&E this last Wednesday with an 
agenda that included some sharing of sampling results collected downstream of 
their first C/S (Topock) and on out west toward their main distribution 
areas.  With respect to the most recent sampling data, Low PCB concentrations 
(N.D. to 38 ppm) have been detected in drips and interconnects between Topock 
and Hinckley C/S.  The good news is that PCB's have not been detected 
downstream of Hinckley which is approx. 160 miles from the Topock C/S.  PG&E 
has also initiated construction and installation of some drips and small 
separators at locations where their gas feeds into other lines or directly 
into customers.  the proposed installation date for the large mainline filter 
separators is still on target for 6/1/00.

Now for the bad news.  At the conclusion of the meeting, PG&E has stated that 
they want their Topock C/S decontaminated.  This includes all piping and 
equipment.  I stated to them the impractabibility and zero success rate of 
removing all the PCB's from their system and that there would be no 
quarantees that the deconning would be successful.   The contract PCB 
deconning companies only have permits which would guarantee cleanup to 10 
ug.  They were told that it would be impossible to clean everything and that 
in all probability the PCB concentrations would be showing up as the gas 
continues to move through the system.  Additionally, the better remediation 
approach would be to continue to remove PCB containing liquids at strategic 
locations.  Even with this, they were pretty insistent that their management 
wanted the facility cleaned.  Preliminary $$ estimates range to approx. 3-5 
million.

I think that this is only the ""tip of the iceberg"".  If they are successful 
with this action, the pipeline system will be next.  Their pipeline is not 
piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe, valves etc. 

Ill keep you informed on this,,,,,,,

"Re: TRANSWESTERN RB211","Arnold, I think I will pass on the meeting.  Please apprise me of anything I 
may need to know from the meeting.  To bring you up to date on the 
environmental events of the turbine approvals in Arizona,  I received the 
rough draft of the baseline noise survey and you were copied.  As discussed, 
we should address changes to the documents as the contractor has made some 
obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not valid or representative of 
what we would like to do or not do.  I was contacted by the Navajo Nation and 
they have requested that we do onsite surveys at the C/S on the reservation 
(C/S 3 and 4)  for T&E plants and animals and archeology.  I have contacted a 
contractor and they will be on site to do the surveys at both stations.  I am 
planning on having the entire C/S facility surveyed at both locations as 
there has not been a pin point location established as yet for all the 
construction and ground disturbance which will take place.  In the event 
there might be changes after the survey is completed, surveying the entire 
facility will keep us from having the new distrubance areas surveyed after 
the original survey was completed.  The F-1 environmental document for the 
FERC application will be submitted to Donna by this friday.   The air permit 
applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.   I have a meeting with EPA 
in San Francisco to discuss permitting the C/S facilities on the reservation 
on 3/20.  Im going to try and move this meeting up if possible.  After the 
meeting, I should be able to have an application in front of the Navajo air 
permitting agency and the EPA within a week.  Based upon experience with the 
state of Arizona, EPA and the Navajo Nation, expect permit approval within 
5-7 months after submittal of the application.

Dear Arnold:

Thanks for your time today. This note is to confirm my understanding of
our discussion:

1- Our John March  is to receive some additional operating points next
week.  John will also receive advice about the CO requirement at part
load.  John will then run compressor and GT performance data at those
points.  He will indicate our method for achieving the CO requirement at
the specified points, as well as, at other part  loads.
2- Furthermore,  John will advise our method of ensuring that the engine
will not exceed the required CO concentration at part loads.   We may
utilize a bleed system to achieve the required CO, and also a control
algorithm that precludes the engine from dipping below a certain load
level.
3-  Items 1 and 2, will be topics of a meeting to be held in Houston
during Monday, 12-March.  Scope of supply, delivery committment, spare GG
pricing, and RR hold of a spare PT will also be topics for the meeting.

As a new point,  I'd like to confirm our interest in showing you how the
6761 will achieve your needs at the meeting in Houston.

Please see the attached file and notes on this years pigging activites from
Station 5 through Needles.  This does not include all the analyticals for
this time period but should represent 90% of all pigging activites.  Filter
and scrubber samples may also exist.

Larry can you give a hand with this?  I thought these results were already
forwarded to Penn State weeks ago and being forwarded on an ongoing basis.
They have yet to receive any historical sampling data either.  Please
advise.

Larry,

I received this email message from Leslie this afternoon... she asked if I
had received the letter from her that approved TW's request to discontinue
the groundwater monitoring at the Puckett site.

She may have asked this because she may have expected to receive an annual
report last week.

Last week, I sent to you a draft of what I thought should go into the new
annual reports, now that we don't have any groundwater monitoring to report.

Please let me know if you want me to send an annual report to her.

Later,
James

"Results of the Environmental Meeting at C/S 6, Laguna","A meeting was held at C/S 6, Laguna on Tuesday November 16th, to reintroduce 
the pueblo of Laguna to Transwestern's environmental activities at the 
facility.  The Laguna's have hired an environmental person to oversee 
environmental issues on pueblo lands.  The meeting centered around three 
issues:  a UST site which had been removed, but not formally closed, a 
historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the 
late 1980's, and the ongoing groundwater remediation at  the site.  

Transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why 
these issues were unresolved in the ""eyes"" of the Laguna.  Transwestern 
committed to submitting closure requests for the UST and asbestos issues.  
With repsect to the groundwater issue, a presentation was given enlighting 
the Laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology 
and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants 
(chlorinated solvents and PCB's) and Transwestern's intent to continue its 
remediation efforts. Transwestern assured the Laguna environmental 
representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental 
issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency.   At the conclusion of the 
meeting, the Laguna's understood Transwestern's commitment to maintaining the 
policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of Laguna.

The meeting provided Transwestern and the Laguna's with the opportunity to 
meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships.  The 
Laguna's now have an understanding of the environmental activities at the 
site and what Transwestern's approach is to removing the contaminants.   The 
Laguna's appreciated Transwestern's efforts and commitment to environmental 
compliance on the Laguna pueblo.

"Phone Conversation with TNC","Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature 
Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She 
was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts 
to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may 
have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed 
route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did  
offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area 
which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.  

The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological 
regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and 
animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The 
TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be 
used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed 
prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of 
Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of 
ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species 
which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be 
impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction 
across Arizona.  

I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition 
to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the 
environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the 
pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and 
unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle 
on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this 
piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful 
the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known.

weed and mesquite control, monthly site inspections recordkeeping etc.....).  
Continue to keep the records accurate and up to date.  I anticipate that we 
will be required to monitor  and conduct housekeeping activities at the site 
indefinately.

"RE: Albuquerque Environmental Roundtable, Oct. 16-17","John, I look forward to you being there, hopefully,  for both days.  Your 
presence and participation shows the field teams the environmental commitment 
from Houston. 

Concerning the agenda, the first day is devoted to presentations.  The second 
moring will be devoted to a  ""surprise"" participation at a local compressor 
station about 45 miles west of Albuquerque.  I havent spread this around yet, 
except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but  I plan on dividing the guys into 
groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor 
station.  I plan on setting and hiding  some placebo environmental issues the 
night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other 
housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit.  We will then convine 
back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they 
would address the issues identified.  The group that identifies the most 
issues, will get a small gift.  Do I need your approval on the spending of 
some $$$ for a gift?  I was thinking of a couple of $25 gift certificates for 
the two winners at a big sporting goods store and let them choose what they 
want.  The final afternoon session will be devoted to mock environmental 
situations under varying circumstances, like we did last year with the whole 
group being divided into four individuals and participating as teams.

The state of Texas conducted an air quality inspection of the NNG Seminole 
C/S.  There were no deficiencies or violations identified at the facilit 
during the inspection.

The State of New Mexico Air Quality Bureau conducted an inspection of the 
Transwestern Atoka No. 3 C/S.  The Agency conducted a record review and did 
portable emissions testing of 3 of the 5 emissions units at the facility.  
Although fuel use and a natural gas analysis were not available for the units 
tested, emissions exceedances for NOx are expected for the 2 White Superiors 
at the facility.  

The State of New Mexico Air Quality Buureau conducted an inspection of the 
Transwestern Atoka No. 2 C/S.  The agency conducted a portable emissions 
testing of the two turbines and one recip at the facility.  Although fuel use 
and a natural gas analysis was not available at the facility, all units 
tested  appeared to be in compliance with the permit limits.  The agency 
requested sulfur readings from the fuel gas as required under Subpart GG NSPS 
for the last twelve months.  The Artesia team has contacted Gas Control in 
Houston for the for the monthly sulfur values at the facility.

"Weekly Environmental Activity Report-Roswell Area","Atttended the NMOGA meeting in Farmington, NM.  It appears that the BLM will 
implement its own noise criteria in areas within New Mexico that are deemed 
sensitive by the BLM.  The proposed noise threshold will be 48.6 DBA(A).  
There are no Transwestern facilities in the Farmington resource area which 
will be impacted by this proposed level, however the potential exists for 
several Transwestern locations in southeast New Mexico to be impacted.  

A meeting was held with the president of Del Mar, concerning the issues 
associated with the lead in their lead acetate tape for monitoring sulfur 
concentrations in the natural gas.  A  request  was made to the company to 
determine the feasability of recycling the tape and eleviate the management 
and disposal issues associated with the tape as a hazardous waste.  

The quarterly SoCal Transwestern PCB conference call was held this week.  
Transwesten's share (86%) of SoCal's PCB management activities was approx. 
$79,000.  Due to the press release  by PG&E concerning the increased 
occurance of PCB's into their system, SoCal has initiated increased sampling 
activities on their system and will be proposing to do additional monitoring 
to track liquids from Transwestern's M/S into the SoCal system.  Preliminary 
sampling results at strategic liquids locations on the SoCal system has 
revealed hits of PCB's in the range of 7-10 ppm, although, a  hit of 77 ppm  
was discovered.  

As a result of an isolated hit of PCB's into the new filter separator at the 
PG&E C/S in excess of regulated levels, a  conference call was held the ET&S 
VP to determine forthcoming activities with PG&E.  A meeting has been 
scheduled at the PG&E C/S next week to reveiw sampling on the PG&E system and 
discuss the recent hit of PCB's in the F/S and what forthcoming activities 
will be conducted at the site.
