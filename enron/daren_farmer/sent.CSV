I highlghted some changes on your spreadsheet.  Look over these and call me if you have questions.  A couple of the deals have Gas Daily tiers, so I moved them down in the sheet.  I would like for you to make the changes tomorrow after trading.

We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting spreadsheet if you need it.

Deal 514353		Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113
Deal 384258		Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11

 

I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.  

I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan

The question is not that ""cut and dry"". However, for the month of March Enron paid Spinnaker @ IF HSC -$0.085. 
Currently the volume is posted under deal ticket  #144271 with is the deal tick for gas daily production.
This production should be moved to Deal ticket  #144264 with is the IF.

We probably should be invoicing selling to Dow at IF.  However, we should also have purchased the supply from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264) at IF.  Did Spinnaker bill us at Index or Gas Daily?  What did we pay?  Let me know this and we can proceed from there.  Nelson Ferris did these deals.  I will talk to him after I hear from you.

Daren,

Sherlyn Schumack suggested that I contact you with this matter.  I am working on some old HPL issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up, #208101, but this deal was subsequently killed (no reason found).  This deal was copied from #205533 which was good through 2/29/00.  Please set up a valid deal for March 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby HPL is buying gas from ENA on Tejas at the same points.  This deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to Reliant Energy.  Please note that Reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made.

If I have not provided enough information or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  As I need to resolve this issue as soon as possible, your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated.

"Re: Me Again","Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done.

Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.

Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.

"HPL/LOBO Imbalance","Rita, 

In order to book the imbalance payback between HPL and Lobo, I have created deal 1166748 (ENA selling to AEP @ $2.45).  I have changed the price on Deal 1109140 from $0.00 to $2.455.  From what I understand, we received the gas at King Ranch, sold it to AEP so that they would move it through the header on their contract and bought it back at a half cent difference.  Following that, we sold the gas to the central desk, who sold it to Oneok at the South Texas pool.  With the changes I made and the entries you are able to do, hopefully this deal will be wrapped up.  Let me know if you need me to do anything else.

Also what services you want on each so we get all the necessary contracts done.

For the Texas Desk, Mike Olsen and I will start out handling the scheduling activities.  As we start up we will not be doing a lot of shipping on the intrastate pipes.  We will primarily be utilizing hub and cartwheel agreements and net outs.  Trading primarily on the Waha, Katy , and Carthage hubs.  I will cover Katy and Carthage.  Mike will continue to cover Waha and any shipping activities on the intrastate pipes.  I will need a second person fairly soon after we begin trading again (within a month or two).  

What are you thinking that we need to look into on the intrastates?

Also, with message of setting up new budgets, can you have Brandy send me a copy of the budget we had in place for Texas 2002? 

Thanks.

Subject:	NETCO Items

Wanted to share the latest communication on NETCO. This is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward. I will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below. 

For a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the NETCO team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown. I know you took a preliminary look at this but I want you all to rethink and give me a ""final or startup"" list. The list you gave me on the contracts required for NETCO on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed. I believe we need to take a look at some of the Intrastates and key LDC's and get that info on the list. Seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6. I'll try and get some details today. Don't know if we will be allocated spots on 6. IT systems layout and structure is already being planned/discussed. Most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture.

In addition any other items for a re-start that you can think of please forward to me. 

Of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once/if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase. Let's be optimistic and hope they are interested in the NETCO structure that has been laid out. Regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready.

Thanks - Bob

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

Subject:	GLO/EGM Gas/Crude Swap

George - I've done some T-accounts (the bean counter in me) and I think the following is the best way to handle this going forward:
	
Change the existing deals, 547201 and 591307, to a zero price.  This will eliminate the A/R balance on HPL's books for GLO, but will keep the volume nom'd to GLO and will not impact UA4.
Enter a ticket on HPL for a sale to ENA for the value of the gas that was zeroed out on the above tickets.  This should be entered as a demand charge only and the amounts should be $974,144 for 1/01 and $766,304 for 2/01.
Enter a ticket on ENA where the ENA-Wellhead Book purchases the demand from HPL.  The amounts would be the same as in #2 above.
Enter a ticket on ENA where the ENA-Wellhead Book sells demand to EGM for the value of the crude oil for the prior month.  For 1/01, the sale would be for $886,638.60 (the 12/00 Crude Oil delivered to EGM by GLO).  For 2/01, the sale would be for $839,008.29 (the 1/01 Crude Oil delivered to EGM by GLO).

This will require the following steps be taken monthly as this deal goes forward:
The price on the sale from HPL to GLO will need to be zeroed out monthly.
The demand charges on steps 2 and 3 will have to be updated to reflect the value zeroed out.
The demand charges on step 4 will have to be updated to reflect the value of the crude delivered to EGM.

Once this is done, the A/R balance for GLO will be cleared, the margin will be on the ENA Wellhead book, and the intercompany transactions will move the money from EGM to HPL.  This needs to be done monthly prior to flash, which will prevent any OA variances.  The index for the gas value is available shortly after the 1st of the month, and since the volume is firm, there shouldn't be a problem calculating the value.  We should also know the value of the crude oil so that we can flash the sale from ENA to EGM.  If you have any questions or see a better way to do this, please let me know.  Thanks.

Two quick questions... 

Volume Management seems to think that we had business on Blue Dolphin Pipeline for August 2001.  I told them that we had none, and that whatever they have is AEP business.  They insisted that it was ours and sent down Allocation Statements from Blue Dolphin.  WE have nothing in the system, so I have no idea what to say to them beyond what I think is the case, that AEP has this business now.

As for the Industrial research, I got your message and I assume I should focus on the ones on the map.  The map has 17 plants listed with pipeline connects.  I will call them for capacities and flexibility.

All errors were taken care of by Jay and I with little trouble.

"Tenaska IV Agency Agreement","Ed, 

ENA has acted as agent for Tenaska IV , a generation facility in Cleburne, Texas, in which , Enron has ownership interest.  Our role was to manage the fuel requirements for the plant.  This includes scheduling, invoicing, and settling the natural gas supplies and transportation.  In addition to the daily activity, ENA has the responsibility to sale any excess fuel from the baseload supplies and purchase an additional fuel needs.  Any profits/losses are passed on to Tenaska IV.  ENA is just paid a monthly fee for the service.  Rick Hill is my contact person for the project. He is looking into finding another party to handle this fuel management responsibility.  If he can't find a party willing to do this under similar terms, we will need to find some one with the Enron estate to handle this.  The problem with Enron continuing in the role is the inability to transact in the gas market (no customers willing to trade with us).  So, the project is losing value.  Please give me a call when you get a chance.  Or, maybe we can meet sometime next week to go over this.  My schedule is pretty flexible.

Megan

As I mentioned to you yesterday, it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to TX GLO do not have Linda Robert's origination fee deducted.  Do we need to execute a PMA with TXGLO to deduct those volumes from the next delievery?

Also isn't there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to TXGLO?  Is that being captured in Unify or is it being manually entered by Gas Accounting?

Darren
Do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct?

Susan/Laynie
What busines unit are these cost centers rolling up to (11814 & 27117?)

I reviewed the gas deals on Franks' spreadsheet and they agree with what is in Sitara.  As soon as I have the October gas numbers, I will forward them to you.

Attached is a spreadsheet of the TGLO deals booked to the GL to help you with our current settlement position.  It is divided by debit/credit entries.  When the sales are booked, a debit hits the customer account to create the open sale to apply the cash to and a credit hits the revenue account (40004000 third party; 40005000 intercompany) for the profit center.  

Below is a summary of where we are on the sale dollars to EGM.  I have already sent an email to risk to update the demand fees for the prior months and to book Aug and Sept crude.  I will wait for the go ahead from Frank before I final them to the GL.    Let me know if you have any questions.

Megan

Status of Sales to EGM
Cleared invoices		$3,905,963.20
Open Invoices		$1,177,587.60

I have attached a revised schedule of the EEX deal.  I have included our bid price and  additional notes for each field. If  you will re-print the quote sheets, I will enter our bids on them.  Additionally, since we are bidding to buy the gas delivered to the ""liquid"" areas, please make sure that our agreements with EEX state that the gas must be pipeline quality and must be able to be delivered into the pipes specified on the attached schedule.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Daren,

I have no problem sticking around with the group, it is a compliment and I am glad that you all appreciate what I have been able to contribute to the group.  I just want your opinion on something.

One of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a  senior analyst or third year analyst.  It is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase.  In no way do I want to imply greed, or that I will only stay for money, but if in your opinion I may be deserving of this, then maybe we could run it by Bob or the program, or whoever is in control of that.  

Just a thought, let me know what you think.

Subject:	ENA Origination Track

All,

ENA is building an ENA Origination Track similar to that of the Trading Track.     Originators on both the Gas & Power side at the VP level have bought into the development of this program.    The management of the program will be the originators themselves under Louise Kitchen.   There will be structured rotations for the Analysts & Associates who join this program with a clear objective in mind - final rotation will be in Origination.

The below people, according to our records, are currently in your groups.   These candidates have been identified as they have completed at least one relevant rotation and/or have performed well in the previous prc.     Prior to contacting the below Analysts & Associates, I want to ensure your buy-in/recommendation of these candidates.      All selected candidates would be formally interviewed by the Origination management team (both gas & power) prior to joining the program.

I would be grateful for your early response as we are looking to schedule a date in November to commence interviews.

If you have any questions, please let me know and I will be happy to explain the program in greater detail.

Kind regards,

Karen

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty			Meter			Volumes	Deal #	Price				Period		Global No.
Comstock Oil &Gas			9872			500mmbtu/d	652448	100% GD less $0.20		3/30-3/31	96057106

															4/01-4/30	96058382
	
FYI, we will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of the deal beginning with the appropiate month.  Additionally, these are Producer Svcs. deals and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.

It looks like we took some of the gas we purchased from Williams (deal 384237) on the Cleburne desk and moved it to ENA's transport contract with deal 502861.  The print screen below shows the deal from Zone transport to ENA-Texas.  I think we need a deal from Cleburne to Zone Transport to complete to deal path and clean up the UA4.  Can you review the deals for November and let me know what you think?  Jim says there is UA4 every month of this deal and this may be the reason.  I will have to check each month.

Thanks,
Megan

In looking at  the MTD prod. vs. nom numbers, we have consistently been under nominated by about 2,000/day at Three Rivers and 2,000/day at the Saxet well.  We are making our imbalance worse, cumulative.  We need to update our forward position and our nomination by 4,000/day to stay in balance to entitlements.

Because the payback was done for October 2001, we can't do it in POPS so we will have to make manual entries to clear the imbalance from the books and show the sale from HPL to ENA.

What time frame do intend to do this in?  I believe this contract is no longer effective after May 31, so if it is in October you will have to reactivate the transport contract so you can book it in POPS.

"FW: Cleburne issues","Jeff, 

The message below is in reference to the voice message and e-mail I sent you a couple of weeks ago.  We are serving as agent for Tenaska IV, with the duties of scheduling and settling for the fuel needs of the Cleburne plant.  In November, the plant was not running at full capacity, so we sold the excess fuel gas to TXU Fuel and TXU Gas Distribution.  In doing this, we ended up with a net payment owed to Tenaska IV (in normal months, Tenaska pays us and then we pay the suppliers and pipelines.  All profits/losses are passed through to Tenaska.  ENA receives a management fee).  Can we pay intercompany bills?  How should we go forward with this agency responsibility?

Subject:	Cleburne issues

Daren, with Megan gone I just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the Enron payments owed to the Cleburne plant.  The current issues are as follows:

November Gas Sales					$600,377.50
October payment to ENA for TXU pipeline charges	$108,405.00
Cleburne receivable from Enron				$708,782.50

Less: November Gas Agency Fees			($54,000.00)

Net Cleburne Receivable from Enron			$654,782.50

Per my discussions with Megan, she stated that about $500K of the $600K Nov gas sales was intercompany (desk to desk) sales, with the remainder from TXU.  Are we able to settle any intercompany deals now? Are we able to settle with TXU?

Additionally, you'll see that I included the Oct TXU payment in the receivable owed to Cleburne also.  This is because I always pay Megan based upon the pipeline estimates in Michael's file, even though they are not finalized until the next month.  Therefore in my November payment to Enron, I paid ENA for October's estimate, of which Megan would have paid the final bill on 12/26/01 when it was finalized.  However, I had to pay the October bill directly last month, even though I had already sent the funds to ENA in November.  Therefore, I essentially paid this bill twice (once to ENA in Nov & once to TXU in Dec).  I deducted the November Agency Fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to Cleburne.

Please advise as to the status of these bills.  You can reach me at 713-853-7280.  Thanks.

James

AP-College Station Texas----
Texas A&M football practice was delayed on Monday for nearly two  hours at Kyle Field. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room  happened to look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery  substance on the practice field. 
Head coach R.C. Slocum immediately suspended practice while the FBI was  called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined  that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line.  
Practice was resumed when FBI Special Agents decided that the team would not  be likely to encounter the substance again.

Daren,

Yes, the gas on Deal 210722 is going to Reliant, however, it needs to be Brokered instead of Service as Tejas does not show any transport.  I don't know if it can be changed or if a new deal needs to be set up.

Daren,

Sherlyn Schumack suggested that I contact you with this matter.  I am working on some old HPL issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up, #208101, but this deal was subsequently killed (no reason found).  This deal was copied from #205533 which was good through 2/29/00.  Please set up a valid deal for March 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby HPL is buying gas from ENA on Tejas at the same points.  This deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to Reliant Energy.  Please note that Reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made.

If I have not provided enough information or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  As I need to resolve this issue as soon as possible, your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated.

Buddy

"FW: Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman  
Sent:	Friday, November 09, 2001 5:49 PM
To:	DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide1
Subject:	Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy


Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

I have a price discrepancy with one of Stacey's deals with Texaco Natural Gas for April 2001.  It is deal 695976 for 12,000/day.  We have it priced at WAHA gas daily + 0.005 and Texaco says it should be WAHA IF + 0.005.  Rick O'Bannion, the trader at Texaco, has confirmed their price.  Can you check this for me and let me know which is correct?

I have attached a revised schedule of the EEX deal.  I have included our bid price and  additional notes for each field. If  you will re-print the quote sheets, I will enter our bids on them.  Additionally, since we are bidding to buy the gas delivered to the ""liquid"" areas, please make sure that our agreements with EEX state that the gas must be pipeline quality and must be able to be delivered into the pipes specified on the attached schedule.  Let me know if you have any questions.

For Mobil in March, beginning on March 21, HPL started delivering 30,000/d for MidCon (just like we did in Dec and Jan, and maybe in Feb too)

Check with Daren Farmer when you get ready to do the flash invoice on the first to confirm the MidCon volume amounts and dates

I have another HPLC issue...I received an invoice from Four Square Gas Company today for May 2001 gas that was never paid.  They have invoiced 1,654 at 4.825 (HSC - .085) at meter 986887.  I did not see a deal in Unify, so I went to POPS to find the meter.  I found that the gas was pathed to the Strangers Gas contract.  Historically, HPLC has always purchased the gas at this meter from Four Square, but it doesn't look like a deal was ever entered for May.  The April deal number was 695469.  Did HPLC purchase this gas in May?

I received the above allocation for this deal where there is a purchase from Spinnaker and a sale to Dow.  The volumes have not be actualized so there is nothing in Volume Management.  Can one of you look into this and get back to me.

"RE: HPL Transport Contracts","On Oasis and PGEV, we have been buying and selling as HPL.  However, we have been transporting the gas under ENA.  This is primarily for spot and base deals.  We want to keep these transport contracts with ENA.  The only term deal we have at Waha is to Tufco (0-60,000/day).  This deal is under ENA with it's own firm transport contract (now on Guadalupe Pipeline, which was previously Teco/PGEV).  The sale and transport will go with HPL.  The sale to Entex off of Oasis (currently under the ENA, will be assigned to HPL) must be served off of Oasis.  So HPL will need to acquire an Oasis contract for this deal.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

I would think that the first contract should go the AEP.  ENA won't be selling to Equistar
off of Channel for at least three months.  ENA will have to get a transport agreement with
HPL or Channel.

On the second contract:  Is HPL making the sale or ENA?  Is it a sale that is going
to AEP.  I know we are serving a small Entex point off of Oasis.  Is that for convenience,
can HPL sever the point some other way?

Someone let me hear what you think.

I spoke with Daren and there are a few contracts that he was aware of:

1. Channel -  012-15600-02-069	ENA using HPL's capacity - selling to Equistar on Channel

2. Oasis and PGEV - HPL is using ENA's capacity

3.  Tejas Ship and Tejas Gas - Daren says we don't do business often on these pipes as ENA, but we always have the possibility that we will at any time, so ENA would need it's own transport contracts

Let me know if anyone has questions.  Thanks!

As I mentioned to you yesterday, it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to TX GLO do not have Linda Robert's origination fee deducted.  Do we need to execute a PMA with TXGLO to deduct those volumes from the next delievery?

Also isn't there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to TXGLO?  Is that being captured in Unify or is it being manually entered by Gas Accounting?

Do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct?

When the sales are booked, a debit hits the customer account to create the open sale to apply the cash to and a credit hits the revenue account (40004000 third party; 40005000 intercompany) for the profit center.  

Below is a summary of where we are on the sale dollars to EGM.  I have already sent an email to risk to update the demand fees for the prior months and to book Aug and Sept crude.  I will wait for the go ahead from Frank before I final them to the GL.    Let me know if you have any questions.

For the Texas Desk, Mike Olsen and I will start out handling the scheduling activities.  As we start up we will not be doing a lot of shipping on the intrastate pipes.

Mike will continue to cover Waha and any shipping activities on the intrastate pipes.  I will need a second person fairly soon after we begin trading again (within a month or two).

Subject:	NETCO Items

Wanted to share the latest communication on NETCO. This is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward. I will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below. 

For a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the NETCO team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown. I know you took a preliminary look at this but I want you all to rethink and give me a ""final or startup"" list. The list you gave me on the contracts required for NETCO on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed. I believe we need to take a look at some of the Intrastates and key LDC's and get that info on the list. Seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6. I'll try and get some details today. Don't know if we will be allocated spots on 6. IT systems layout and structure is already being planned/discussed. Most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture.

In addition any other items for a re-start that you can think of please forward to me. 

Of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once/if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase. Let's be optimistic and hope they are interested in the NETCO structure that has been laid out. Regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready.

Thanks - Bob

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

Per conversation with Rosa Brown and Thu (In Volumes Management, Beaumont Methanol is a swing deal, by which the gas sales allocations are handled by the scheduletr. Thu indicated that you were the scheduler for meter # 981428.

Do you still handle the sales allocations for  HPL meter # 981428?

Hey, Ken.  How's everything going?  I thought about you yesterday here at work and wanted to call but I lost your number.  Send it back to me when you get a chance.  Anyway, we re-started one of the activities you used to love:  balancing Exxon Katy without going through HPL.  It has been a nightmare.  In fact, the guys are still trying to balance the first (it's now noon).  It's been one daisy chain after another.  One small piece changes and it affects 3 other people.  I get tickled every time I think about you going through that.  It has been quite a bit different trading without HPL.  Yesterday, I handled Waha pretty well.  But I got bent over for the weekend.  It has been pretty tough balancing out each point without having transports and storage.

Did you have anything going on over Memorial Day?  We stayed home and worked around the house.  Nothing exciting, but a string of bad luck I'll tell you about sometime.

I hope ya'll are doing good.  Talk to you later.

Please forward this memo and ask your respective schedulers to take a moment to fill in the requested data from your desk spreadsheets below.  We would like to have all responses received before November 1st. 

Please e-mail all responses to Richard Pinion with an updated Excel spreadsheet attached.  I will put together a master sheet from the individual replies.

"RE: Hello out there","Hey Ken.  Well, I'm still here for now.  It's hard to leave.  We have all taken quite a bit of time off (out all last week and a couple of days the week before that.)  I'll only be here a couple of hours today.  But we had a great Christmas.  The kids have been so excited.  I made the mistake of getting a couple of microphones/sirens for their tricycles.  You can hear them all through our neighborhood.  The neighbors have already asked my what I was thinking.  Cole wanted 3 things (a play airport, a pirate ship, and Buzz Lightyear).  He got them all.  With each present, he kept getting louder and more excited.  Jake was primarily interested in in opening presents, he didn't care what was in them.  That kid gets more out of ripping things up and tearing things down than any kid I have ever seen.  In fact, the other day, Cole and I were stacking his big leggo blocks as high as we could go.  Cole likes to make things and he likes them neat and orderly.  So, he was working hard at making this tower stand up and work (it ended up being about eight feet tall).  Well Jake was chomping at the bit to run through it.  After holding him off for a few minutes, I let him go.  You should have seen his eyes light up.  You would have thought it was the biggest event of the year.  He tore through it, smiling all the way, saying ""again, again.""  It has been so fun spending extra time with the kids.  My mom and sister came in the weekend before Christmas.  Tonya's parents and sister came in Friday.  With the couple of days between their visits, I remodeled our downstairs bathroom (strip wallpaper, paint, hung a border, hung crown molding).  That was my first try with crown molding. It turned out ok.  Thank the Lord for wood putty.  So, we've been pretty busy.  But, it's been fun.

How was your Christmas?  Was Santa Claus good to you?  I guess your kids were in.  I hope you had a wonderful time.  I'm looking forward to Corn Boys bowl game.  Anyway, I need to go make a call on a tee time.  Tonya's dad and I decided that we would pay good money to get mad and lose a bunch of balls and break a few clubs, while out in the cold.  It doesn't make much sense, does it?  But then again, most things that men do don't make much sense.

Later, 

Daren

Hey, Derrick

Thanks for the golf journal.  I'm looking forward to using it.  I've read through most of it already, and it looks easy enough to follow.  Golf is just like everything else, it just takes the disciple to practice and to practice correctly.  I know the tips will help me.  Keeping notes is good idea also.  Thanks, also for the golf towel.  I've got a round coming up tomorrow with a few guys from work.  Maybe I can sleep on the book tonight get a little advantage.  If I play like the last time (when David and I played over Christmas), I'll be buying balls from the club house.  Anyway, I hope you are doing well.

Hello Daren,

I spoke with George Smith.  There is no new hire.  It is just him and he will be sitting right next to you.
(only part time) he is still keeping his desk over by me.  Ed Terry does not have any monitors avaliable.
Do you want me to order new equipment for George?  Let me know!

Thanks,

Subject:	Contract status needed

On Monday we have to file a ""transition plan"" with Louise Kitchen for NETCO. She wants details. On that note I need a status report from each desk on our effort to start the contract process for pipes, TPA's & EBB's so I can include that in the report. I have received some emails however I would like each manager to put together a summary in an Excel spreadsheet that we can have Suzanne consolidate with the stuff she already put together. Please cover the key items listed in the earlier email. Also we should be getting as much hard copy as possible so we can proceed with our goal of preparing for a startup. I suggest reviewing the paperwork and identify the stuff that you will need to get the forms completed. No doubt we will have substantial gaps but as long as we know where and what they are we can get the proper internal people involved (legal, credit, etc.)

Tks - Bob

"Re: deal 34342","We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).  ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at mtr 1373 in Feb.  In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any days with flow under 18,000.  So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.  Any shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

Prior to 7/99  this was ENA not HPL, but there may be some issues on it as well for 3/99 to 6/99.  The deal ticket we used was 62717.  I will have to look further into the ENA activity because I know we still have some invoices that were paid under one company and we still have drafts under the other.

I am trying to get some payments out to Williams for old months 11/2000 and 1/2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc. instead of Black Marlin Pipeline Company effective 3/99.  The Black Marlin Pipeline Company was for an internal record (when it was an Enron entity).

I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated during bidweek.  If it is, then we do need to change the price to GD.  If it is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket.

Mary - Please repath these deals and let Megan know when you're done.

Hey kids, Why don't we pool our resources and get "" El Jefe "" something nice?  Not like last year... I won't mention names (Donna).... when some individuals within the team didn't want to include the rest of us in their ""reindeer games"" for bosses day. Any suggestions? Round of golf, gift certificate??? I nominate Suzanne to collect the money. Any objections?

We need to add the sale demand fee to deal 384258 for Tenaska IV for April 2001.  The spreadsheet I have from Mark shows $2,979,909.91.  We already have the agency fee on deal 514353.  Just let me know when it's in.

We need to forward the money from the Feb 2001 Brazos sale to Tenaska IV.  I am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $1,143,484.53.  There is already a demand fee for Feb 2001 for $29,851.64, so I think we just need to change that to the new amount.  Let me know if you want to handle this differently.

Subject:	BCP Seat Assignments
Importance:	High

All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

TXU revised their rates for Jan 2001. They are now billing us at $0.10 and $0.08 for contract 1671.  This was previously billed all at $0.10.  Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $3,841,888.11 to $3,830,131.18.

Also, I spoke to TXU about the rate on contract 1856 (deal 452475).  They have been billing us $0.11 and we have $0.10.  The extra cent is for the El Paso header fee.  The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.  You'll see a a section called ""Compression & Header Expense if Utilized"".  The current rate for 1856 is $0.01 and 0% fuel.  I will leave a copy of the contract in your chair.

Thanks,
Megan

We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting spreadsheet if you need it.

Deal 514353		Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113
Deal 384258		Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11

 

I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.  

I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan

"RE: From the Retiree peanut Gallery","Hey, Ken.  We are in sad shape, aren't we?  I was on vacation last week, through Monday.  Not a good feeling coming back to a sub $20 stock price and an SEC inquiry.  It never really seemed possible to me that Enron would be here.  Other than concerns for my future, everything is going fine.  Things really are ok, I know I can get a job with AEP if I need to.  I actually started talking to them about it.  But on Wednesday, they made a few changes that I'm not so sure about.  Ed Gottlob (recently made VP) was put over the origination desk.  (I heard that they weren't too pleased with Ducoti and Bilberry.)  With that move, they needed someone else to run the trading desk.  That person is our fast-talking friend, Carey Metz.  That blew me away.  I believe their thought was that he would be the best to manage the financial risk.  Apparently he's made a ton of money since he's been in Columbus.  He's also going to stay in Columbus with this responsibility.  So, this may be the first move to bring the group up north with the rest of the family.

The home-life is going well.  We have 3 year-old soccer every Sat.  My lovely wife signed me up to be the coach.  I'm going to get her for that one.  It is fun, though.  Those kids are funny.  They don't care where the ball goes, they just keep kicking (even through the woods).  Looking forward to Halloween.  Cole is going to be a policeman, Jake is going to be a jailbird/prisoner.  Cole has already handcuffed Jake a number of times, he loves it.  My vacation last week was very good.  It was the first extended vacation that I have taken where we didn't have traveling and entertainment stuff planned.  It was one of the best vacations I have had.  We spent 2 days in San Antonio doing the zoo and easy stuff like that.  The rest of the week, we did things around here (like Children's Museum).

Big game coming up this weekend.  Do you think your Huskers can pull it off?  I think OU's going to win it, but it should be a great game.

How about the 6,7, or 8th for lunch?  Later.

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

"Tenaska IV","Rick, 

We need to talk about the ability of ENA to continue its the current role as agent of Tenaska IV.

1)  Since the end on November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions.  We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.

2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.  I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan.  We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.

I don't know how Enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.  But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.

Please give me a call or e-mail me.  We can get together sometime Thurs or Fri morning.

I believe that Jill was going to show EEX a bid with the understanding that any deals on HPL would go with the pipeline after the sale. We were working under the thought that we need continue to conduct business as usual for HPL until the sale is finalized. The HPL piece is just a portion of supply that we are bidding on, and Jill was going to present them with bids for their total package (Enron and HPL).  Let me know what you want to do. If you don't want to place a bid, I will pass that on.

I have several changes to the demand fees for Tenaska IV.  Let me know if you have any questions.

For Dec 2000, we need to adjust the demand fee on deal 529856 to account for a volume change on the receipt side.  We overpaid Williams and are going to take our money back.  We then need to refund Tenaska IV.  Please change the demand fee from $878,330.63 to $918,566.13.

For Feb 2001, please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $2,341,675.50 to $3,438,325.95.  Tenaska IV owes us for the remaining expenses.  Also, please change the agency volume on deal 514353 from 45,000 to 45,067.

For March 2001, please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $2,591,791.50 to $2,653,694.95.  I have attached the March spreadsheet I received from Mark in case you want to see it.

Subject:	NEON Dinner


Happy New Year!
 
Next Saturday, January 12, is our get together  dinner.  Instead of going out to a restaurant, Myra and Rodney Burke  graciously offered the use of their home for a nice catered dinner.  Myra  has a friend who will be preparing a full meal for us, served buffet  style.  We'll meet at 7:00 until 10'ish.  I'm thinking the  dress should be snappy casual (I don't really know what that means, but it  sounds good).  We're going to have an appetizer, salad, herb pork loin  something or other, vegetables, dessert, the whole fancy dinner  thing.  It should be great.
 
The caterer needs an exact count of how many  will be there, so let me know by next Wednesday, January 9,   (incidently, our first NEON back) that you'll be there.  Brad Cox wants to  treat you to dinner, so all you need to bring is yourself, and if married, your  spouse. 
 
So call a babysitter, email me back, and lets  get together! 
 
(I've heard some people may not have gotten the  emails concerning this date and the arrangements--do me a favor and  please make sure your co-leaders know about this).
 
Bobby

On May 27th a lufkin Industrial market will go down by 5,000.  We are going to move this sale to Lyondell meter #   5045    .  The sales price will remain at Index minus $.12.   The sale will remain at Lyondell for approximately 2 weeks.     Since the screen has fallen about $1 this should be a good thing for us and a very nice thing for Entex to do for us.

Thanks,

Janet

Ed and Lauri, 

Jill Zivley is needing bids on various wells from EEX.  I understand that anything that is captive to HPL will be going with the pipeline after the sale.  So, you should probably quote the bids for any of this supply.  I have listed the applicable wells and some limited info in the attached spreadsheet.  Eric Boyt is working on the structuring of the deal. He may be contacting   you. He would like to get the bids to Jill by Friday.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Listed below are some guidelines for gathering the necessary information for NETCO contract setup so we can get as much done as possible prior to our start date. I suggest each manager start making the phone calls and if necessary get others at the desk to help out. Again, the goal is to get hard copies of the contracts in our hands for review so we can fill out all of the necessary information ahead of time. Take good notes on the questions that come up when speaking with the pipes. We can get legal involved as needed when major issues surface. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions, tks - Bob

Hi All-

Attached above is the master list of contracts we'll need for Day 1 of NEWCO.  As the footnotes indicate, we'll also need new business party ID's/passwords, an EBB agreement for all pipes and a TPA for each EDI pipe (Tammy & I will be working on TPA's and EBB's).  The timing indicated assumes that we have a clear NEWCO structure, that the NEWCO credit status has been identified, and that a DUNS number has been established.  The two week estimate is built on working through the pipelines' credit process as an entirely new entity and on turning the contracts through Legal on each end, so it may be shorter for some of the simpler agreements but in any event we should estimate at least 3-5 days even for pooling agreements.  For the LDC's and intrastates, we'll need to specifically identify what each requires.

As we discussed, we need to call each pipeline and identify the following information:

Pipeline contact name and number (I know some of you sent me this b/f--but pls make sure that it's the legal/regulatory contact, not your business counterpart)
Credit requirements for a NEW entity with an ""A"" credit rating (they may just refer you to the tariff, if so, pls. ask them for a specific site so we can do the research)
Get a sense of the reaction of the pipe/LDC regarding credit for the new entity--we can set up a discussion between our legal and theirs so we can resolve those issues and move forward to contracting.
in the event that any of them raise the issue of paying any of the old Enron bills, just reiterate that we're setting up a completely new entity and give them Bob's, mine, or Jeff Hodge's name to discuss the estate issues.
If there are different requirements for different service levels (ie, pooling vs. IT vs. FT), pls ask them to specify so that we can get the easier agreements in place first and get business started on the pipe.
We need to get a hard copy of the contract for each service level--pls. ask the pipe/LDC to fax it over or give you a specific reference to their online tariff where we can find it.  Once we have those together, I'll run the traps with Legal.

It would also be helpful if each desk identifies a first and second tier of priority pipes and agreement so that we can get you up and running for the first tier, then work on the second.

I will be out of the office Thursday & Friday, but please call me on my cell phone at 713-516-2574 with any questions.

Thanks,
Suzanne

"MIke Olsen","Bob, 

I would like to recommend a promotion for Mike Olsen.  Mike has been instrumental to the Texas Desk.  With the sale of HPL, we were left with only one scheduler with Texas experience.  Mike took on the responsibility that two people were carrying prior to the sale of the pipeline (Waha scheduling).  He trained our new hire, Jay Smith, and assisted in developing scheduling processes at the Katy Hub.  Prior to the sale of HPL, all of our activity at the Katy hub passed through the pipeline.  Mike used his knowledge of the Waha hub and helped develop a net out procedure that allowed us to effectively schedule our transactions.  Since June, Mike has handled the logistics activities of the majority of Texas pipes (Westar, HPL, PGE, Channel, Oasis, Guadalupe).  Mike most outstanding accomplishment is the over $30,000 he saved us in hub transport fees from July to November.  In July, I began tracking the amount of hub fees that we should have to pay in the Waha area (on EOL we transacted on the basis that the seller pays the transport fees through the hub).  Mike used his knowledge of the pipes, his business relationships, and his negotiation skills to decrease the amount of gas that we scheduled under our contracts.  In essence, I kept a sort of P&L for him.  Mike has taken the desks responsibilities upon himself, as if this were his business.  With the limited number of people on our desk, I needed to split my time between Logistics and Trading.  Truthfully, I spent the majority of my time with the trading.  Mike handled the daily logistics responsibilities.  He acted as lead, supervising and training Jay, our other team member.  Mike performed at a senior level since his first month with the desk.  Mike came to the desk with experience on the pipeline side of the business, accepting nominations and confirming the plants and interconnects. He came to the Texas desk and exceeded all of my expectations. He has advanced quicker than any of the schedulers I've seen.  In fact, he has gone from very minimal marketing logistics knowledge to explaining transactions and processes to other people in the industry with more experience than him.  In short, Mike has been the heart of the Texas Logistics team.  His abilities and hard work have reduced our transport fees, kept our headcount low (he has fulfilled the responsibilities of two people), and enabled the Texas Desk to close time sensitive deals and transact in increasingly complicated deals.  Mike is a superior employee.  His knowledge, ability, and hard work are essential to the success of the Texas Desk.  Please support him with a promotion.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need any information.  
Thanks.

"RE: I Lowered the Cornboys flag","Hey, Ken

We had a good holiday.  Except for the trip back...it usually takes around 9 hours.  Last night it took 12.  Other than that everything was good.  Played a little golf (play may be too strong a word).  Watched a little football.  Our game with Texas was much better than I expected.  I can't believe Colorado ran over Nebraska like that.  And the OU game...I love college football.  It is so much more exciting than the pros.

Right now, I'm just sitting here watching the stock price bounce around 3.85.  The big boys have been huddling quite a bit today.  I think that we are close to the end.  Layoffs should be announced tomorrow.

So, did you get the Christmas tree after the game?  20 footer?  We'll be out this weekend getting ours and putting up the lights.  Jake doesn't know what's going on.  But, Cole is all excited.  Everything he sees, he wants for ""Chrimsas"".  Knowing Jake, I will probably have to anchor the tree on all sides to keep him from bringing it down.  We'll see how it goes.

I hope you had happy holiday, even with the game.

On that note I need a status report from each desk on our effort to start the contract process for pipes, TPA's & EBB's so I can include that in the report. I have received some emails however I would like each manager to put together a summary in an Excel spreadsheet that we can have Suzanne consolidate with the stuff she already put together. Please cover the key items listed in the earlier email. Also we should be getting as much hard copy as possible so we can proceed with our goal of preparing for a startup. I suggest reviewing the paperwork and identify the stuff that you will need to get the forms completed. No doubt we will have substantial gaps but as long as we know where and what they are we can get the proper internal people involved (legal, credit, etc.)

I don't think that the Agency agreement is going with HPL.  If that has changed, please let me know.  I asked Dave Baumbach about it and he agreed with me.

As far as signing the agreement, I need one thing added.  Under Section 4.A., we need to add something like, ""IN the event that ENA owes Company, payment will be made to Company after ENA has received funds from third party sales of excess supply.""  This situation has occurred when the plant was down for the majority of the month.  ENA sold the supply and net owed Tenaska IV a large sum of money after the admin fee was netted out.

Additionally, TXU pipeline has sent an amendment to the transport contract (adding receipt points).  The contract still has Tenaska Gas Co as a counterparty, instead of Enron North America.  How do we get this corrected?

"RE: HEY","Hey, man!

Well, let me tell you what's' going on.  Every evening and every weekend for the last month and a half, I have been painting and working on the house.  The previous owners of the house had the worst color scheme going (pink in one room and a portion of the entry way, lime sherbet green in the other portion of the entry way).  There is a lot of trim, 4 doors, and a 20 ft ceiling in the living room and entry way.  So it is taking quite a while to complete.  One reason it is taking so long is other things keep breaking (disposal, toilet flanges, alarm system).  In the middle of trying to finish painting, we ripped out the floors in the bathrooms and entry and laid tile (I got the floors ready, we paid to have the tile laid.).  Tonya wants everything done now.  It doesn't bother her that I haven't finished a single project since we started the whole renovation thing.  But, IT'S KILLING ME!  I would like just one finished product.  One small room would be fine.  The house is looking a lot better, though.

I'm trying to not let the work take time away from the kids, so I usually start after 8pm each night.  Plus, when I do work while the kids are running around I pay a high price.  Last week I was painting the baseboards in the dining room, with the gallon of white semi-gloss next to me on the floor.  I had earlier used Windex to clean the window seal and had left the bottle in the middle of the floor.  Jake was coming into the room, watching and climbing up and down the step ladder (6 ft;  he climbs to the very top like it's nothing.  Other people come in and see him up there and freak out.  We just let him go.).  He is big into cleaning (guts it from his mom), so when he saw the Windex he ran and picked it up.  I told him to ""take it to Mama"".  He started out the doorway, but came back in and walked behind me.  I just kept working, thinking that he was watching me.  Then I noticed out of the corner of my eye that he had moved closer to me.  When I turned to look, I just lost my breath.  Jake had dipped the Windex bottle down into the paint can, pulled it out and was holding the bottle over our brown carpet.  White paint was just pouring off the bottle.  It looked like someone had poured paint straight out of the can onto the floor.  Thank goodness it was latex, after about 45 minutes we got it cleaned up.  Cole has helped me with some of the work, such as sanding the walls.  But, he carried his work a little farther than I wanted.  Yesterday, he had a friend over.  They got his tools (play sander/grinder, circular saw, screw drivers), climbed up on his bunk bed, and decided they needed to take the texture off the ceiling.  You should have seen the mess.

I am taking a break this weekend though.  Cole and I are going camping at Lake Livingston.  I am really looking forward to it.  I'm trying to start something with him (and will include Jake when he gets a little bigger)  where we do a guy thing each month.  Last month I took Cole to his first Rockets game.  He loved it.  They are getting too big, too fast.

At work, I guess I'm becoming a full fledge trader.  I will be getting my own book in a couple of days.  I'm pretty nervous about that.  There's not a lot of activity in the training/coaching area around here (hard to believe, huh?).  But, we'll see how it goes.  The last of the HPL/AEP people are moving out of the building tonight.  Everything is on course to close the sale on June 1st.

Anyway, I hope you and Linda are doing well.  We'd like to have you over if we ever get the house in presentable shape.

hey Ken,

Let's do lunch next week.  We are moving into the new building this
weekend.  I'll be able to show you around (if I'm still here).

We had a tough football weekend.  It's about time we got beat.  We
didn't deserve the wins we had.  Anyway, I've got to get to work.
Trying to break $12.00 today.  It's kind of odd...moving into a brand
new building when your stock price has reached an all-time low...

Subject:	Cleburne issues

Daren, with Megan gone I just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the Enron payments owed to the Cleburne plant.  The current issues are as follows:

November Gas Sales					$600,377.50
October payment to ENA for TXU pipeline charges	$108,405.00
Cleburne receivable from Enron				$708,782.50

Less: November Gas Agency Fees			($54,000.00)

Net Cleburne Receivable from Enron			$654,782.50

Per my discussions with Megan, she stated that about $500K of the $600K Nov gas sales was intercompany (desk to desk) sales, with the remainder from TXU.  Are we able to settle any intercompany deals now? Are we able to settle with TXU?

Additionally, you'll see that I included the Oct TXU payment in the receivable owed to Cleburne also.  This is because I always pay Megan based upon the pipeline estimates in Michael's file, even though they are not finalized until the next month.  Therefore in my November payment to Enron, I paid ENA for October's estimate, of which Megan would have paid the final bill on 12/26/01 when it was finalized.  However, I had to pay the October bill directly last month, even though I had already sent the funds to ENA in November.  Therefore, I essentially paid this bill twice (once to ENA in Nov & once to TXU in Dec).  I deducted the November Agency Fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to Cleburne.

Please advise as to the status of these bills.  You can reach me at 713-853-7280.  Thanks.

James

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman  
Sent:	Thursday, November 08, 2001 5:36 PM
To:	DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide
Subject:	SEC Information/Earnings Restatement


Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

yes, you are correct.  when we watchdog, we'll most likely do VM and Settlements and not PM.  But, in the afternoon, if they need payments out the door, PM will get it.  It goes both ways.  So, if you send me who needs to be in the system no matter what, that would help.  

you are correct, 8-12 is logistics critical, and after that it's anyones guess.

Based on Victor's response, I think there is some confusion.  There are actually several critical time periods depending on the group and time of day.  Perhaps to eliminate the confusion you could specify which time period you are going to watchdog.  I interpreted it to mean the 8-12 AM period but Victor was thinking the afternoon.  Depending on the time there might be different people who should be kicked out.

Going forward, as a precautionary measure, we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises.  We will use our Watchdog application in order to initiate this process.  We will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this.  Our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most.

The old list we had from Sybase no longer exists.  I need your help in putting together a new list.  Please provide the list of people who ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL users that have to be on the system.  Obviously, the situation isn't remedied if everyone is an exception user :)

Please provide User Name and Application they need (i.e. Volume Management, Settlements, Path Manager).

The sooner I get this, the sooner we can get this implemented.

Brian, 
 
At 11:20am this morning, a stored procedure (source_dest_list_range_sp, Line #172) being run by Daren Farmer caused the tempdb transaction log on unifygasp to fill up.  This procedure is run routinely by many other users on a daily basis without incident.  At the time of the failure, this stored procedure had been running since 10:51am, or roughly 30 minutes.  I was notified via automatic page at 11:24am; the page indicating that there was 200MB free.  I immediately checked tempdb, which was by full by this time.  Three attempts to clear the transaction log prior to 11:30am finally resulted in a cleared transaction log.
 
Kishore noiced shortly thereafter that there was a problem in the way that Sybase was accounting for its free space, a condition which may have been crucial to the failure since nearly 5GB of space was apparently unavailable to the transaction log.  A reboot of unifyprod2 at 1:40pm cleared this condition.

I believe we need to take a look at some of the Intrastates and key LDC's and get that info on the list. Seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6. I'll try and get some details today. Don't know if we will be allocated spots on 6. IT systems layout and structure is already being planned/discussed. Most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture.

In addition any other items for a re-start that you can think of please forward to me. 

Of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once/if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase. Let's be optimistic and hope they are interested in the NETCO structure that has been laid out. Regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready.

Thanks - Bob

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

Prior to 7/99  this was ENA not HPL, but there may be some issues on it as well for 3/99 to 6/99.  The deal ticket we used was 62717.  I will have to look further into the ENA activity because I know we still have some invoices that were paid under one company and we still have drafts under the other.

I am trying to get some payments out to Williams for old months 11/2000 and 1/2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc. instead of Black Marlin Pipeline Company effective 3/99.  The Black Marlin Pipeline Company was for an internal record (when it was an Enron entity).

Bob,

It looks as if my days in HPL are numbered as the transition gets closer and closer.  If you have any time, I would like to discuss with you further the exact plans for me.  

I was told that I would be moving over to the other building with this group.  I just want to set up when I will be moving back.  I would like to slip right in and begin work immediately.  I would also like to get a clearer picture on what I will be doing.  I have a few more weeks to learn from my current group, and I will better be able to take advantage of that time if I can have a better understanding of my role in the new group.

Thanks.

Mike

Subject:	Tenaska IV

Rick, 

We need to talk about the ability of ENA to continue its the current role as agent of Tenaska IV.

1)  Since the end on November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions.  We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.

2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.  I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan.  We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.

I don't know how Enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.  But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.

Please give me a call or e-mail me.  We can get together sometime Thurs or Fri morning.

Rich & Ellen:

We have some problems with the following two counterparties: TXU Gas Distribution & Enbridge Consumers Gas.  For TXU Gas Distribution, this is a unconsolidated division of TXU Gas Company and all deals booked under TXU Gas Distribution should be confirmed as TXU Gas Company.  I understand this is not the case.  For Enbridge Consumers Gas, this is not a valid entity.  At some point it will be a correct name, but for now deals should be confirmed and booked under Consumers Gas Co. Ltd.  

Each has a relatively recent deal booked to it that need to be changed as described above: Sitara 1085609 for TXU and 1086002 for Enbridge Consumers Gas.  

Please advise if there is something I need to do from my end to get this issue resolved.
