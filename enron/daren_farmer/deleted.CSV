"Attendance","
Hey guys, if you're the person keeping attendance  in your group could you let me know that you're the attendance person for this  year.  You also need to get a copy of your group's info to Becky  Poindexter at the church.  I think she is ready to catch up on your  attendance for the fall semester so far.  I'll get your records from  her.
 
Keep up the good work!

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"Update From American Airlines","Dear Mr. Jerry Daren Farmer,
I promised to keep you informed and wanted to provide an update on the situation surrounding Flight 587. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation is still underway, with both the cockpit voice and flight data recorders being analyzed for clues about the cause of the accident.
In addition to our normal aircraft inspection program, and as purely a precautionary measure, we have begun a voluntary inspection of all tail fins on the Airbus A300 fleet.  The inspection process started on Thursday and should be concluded next week. We have completed approximately 25% of the inspections. While we don't anticipate any problems, we certainly want to look at any and all possibilities for the accident's cause.  When the inspection is finished we will communicate those results.
On behalf of all of us at American Airlines, I want to thank everyone for the outpouring of support we've received following Monday's tragedy. We are heartened by the many notes of care and concern. The unprecedented actions over the past 60 days have tested the entire nation in a way that could not be envisioned prior to September 11. 
I hope that you find these communications informative. It is my pledge to you to keep you informed of not only issues surrounding the accident but also security and airport process measures that we are implementing across our system.
On behalf of the 100,000 employees at American, TWA and American Eagle, thanks for your support.
Sincerely, 
Mike Gunn
Executive Vice President
American Airlines

(Dave's response)
Oh my God! How worried should I be? There are 11 letters in the name
""David Pawson!"" I'm going into hiding NOW. See you in a few weeks.
Wait a sec ... just realized ""YOU CAN'T HIDE"" also has 11 letters! What
am I gonna do? Help me!!! The terrorists are after me! ME! I can't
believe it! Oh crap, there must be someplace on the planet Earth I could
hide! But no ... PLANET EARTH"" has 11 letters, too!  Maybe Nostradamus can
help me. But dare I trust him? There are 11 letters in ""NOSTRADAMUS."" I
know, the Red Cross can help. No they can't... 11 letters in ""THE RED
CROSS,"" can't trust them. I would rely on self defense, but ""SELF DEFENSE""
has 11 letters in it, too! Can someone help?  Anyone? If so, send me email.
No, don't... ""SEND ME EMAIL"" has 11 letters....

Will this never end? I'm going insane! ""GOING INSANE???"" Eleven letters!!
Nooooooooooo!!!!!! I guess I'll die alone, even though ""I'LL DIE ALONE"" has
11 letters.....  Oh my God, I just realized that America is doomed! Our
Independence Day is July 4th ... 7/4 ... 7+4_!
~Dave
      PS. ""IT'S BULLSHIT"" has 11 letters also.

kinda funny

<<
 Top Ten List:
 How you can tell you grew up in the Church of Christ.....

 10.  You know the 1st, 2nd, and 4th verses to nearly every song in the
 book.

 9.  You think it might be unscriptural to drain the baptistry.

 8.  You were 18 years old before you knew that guideguardanddirectus was
not
one word.

 7.  You used to think the offering was part of the Lord's Supper.

 6.  You've wondered who Ebon Pinon was.

 5.  You've never seen an original showing of ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" or any
other program aired on early Wednesday or Sunday nights.

 4.  You were the only kid in 6th grade who knew what ""acappella"" meant.

 3.  You were the only kid who had actually sung alto or tenor before
 taking junior high chorus.

 2.  During a service you have: laughed, cried, spanked a child, dropped a
book, walked to the bathroom, passed a note, emptied your purse on the pew,
eaten a cookie, chewed gum, taken medicine, whispered to someone sitting
beside you, winked at a friend, coughed, sneezed, burped, or said ""amen,""
but
you have NEVER, EVER clapped.

 And the #1 way to tell that you grew up in the church of Christ:

 1.  You have stood for 13 verses of ""Just As I Am"" with the last stanza
 sung softly.

 Phil. 1:3  ""I thank my GOD every time I remember YOU!""

 Visa has teamed up with NFL players Brett Favre, Emmitt Smith, and Jerome Bettis to give you a chance to win all your Visa purchases! Find out more at: http://www.visa.com/nfl   You are receiving these e-reports because you have signed up for NFL Fantasy Football.  To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  Latest NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.  Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Okie Pride Updated 10/14/01 According ! to! published reports, an MRI on Faulk's right knee revelead a bone bruise, and no cartilage or ligament damage. He is expected to miss at least one game before being re-evaluated.   Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/14/01 Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical silence,  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33 carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues to play a! t ! his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even when Ricky Watters returns.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and is no better than a reserve at this point.   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective.   Laveranues Coles  , WR NYJ - Sack Attack Updated 10/14/01 Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a roster spot.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Terminators Updated 10/14/01 Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right.   Glyn Milburn , RB CHI - Fr! ee! Agent Updated 10/14/01 Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will be re-evaluated on Monday.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/14/01 Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider dropping Bennett altogether.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/14/01 Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at this point, but he'! s ! easily worth a roster spot if available.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Batch had a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three scores. He's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the performance, but he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Franks caught only two passes for four yards against the Ravens, but both catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as a primary goal-line threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.  David Patten  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Patten had a good game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73 yards. He'll likely be pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry Glenn is back, so don't be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat.   Antonio Freeman , WR GB - Fightin Farmers Updated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this week.  Travis Taylor ,! W! R BAL - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. The second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltimore passing game.  Terry Glenn , WR NE - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Glenn had a huge game in his return from suspension, catching seven passes for 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a weekly basis, but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with your receivers.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Brookins rushed for 33 yards and a TD against Green Bay. The y! ou! ng, strong back might continue to emerge in Baltimore's offense as the season wears on.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Terminators Updated 10/14/01 Brown had a great outing against San Diego, posting 11 catches for 117 yards against San Diego. With Terry Glenn returning, Brown could become a pretty relaible Fantasy player facing No. 2 cornerbacks on a weekly basis.   Darnay Scott , WR CIN - WidowMakers Updated 10/14/01 Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the Browns, but he scored on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scott in the passing game, even though the final numbers haven't always reflected it.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Pongo Pack Updated 10/14/01 Conway had a solid game, posting four catches for 117 yards against New England. He is slowly becoming Doug Flutie's favorite target, and is becoming a much more reliable Fantasy player than in years past.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win over San Diego, but he did score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantasy player, however, and is no better than a reserve used only when the matchup is right.   Kevin Johnson , WR CL! E ! - Terminators Updated 10/14/01 Johnson caught eight passes for 153 yards and a TD against the Bengals. It appears the Cleveland wideout is starting to re-emerge as a quality Fantasy player.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Brady had his first impressive outing on Sunday, throwing for 364 yards and two touchdowns in the Patriots' 29-26 overtime win over San Diego. Despite the great performace, Brady is still not worth anything more than a reserve spot Fantasy-wise.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Bloomin Idiots Updated 10/14/01 Jackson played against Cincinnati, but was l! im! ited to only 22 rushing yards on 14 carries. The rookie running back, who played despite some rib problems, has been inconsistent and unreliable so far.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Okie Pride Updated 10/14/01 Tomlinson's yardage numbers (87 total) were subpar by his standards, but he did score another touchdown for San Diego. He's one of the top tailbacks in the league and should be a weekly starter Fantasy-wise.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Okie Pride Updated 10/14/01 Flutie had a solid game on Sunday, posting 270 yards passing and a touchdown against New England. He's still not worth starting every week, but is better of used when the matchup is right.   Justin McCareins  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 McCareins started in place of the injured Derrick Mason on Sunday against Tampa Bay. He did have two catches for 70 yards in the game, but still warrants very little Fantasy consideration.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Hayes caught seven passes for 44 yards against the Saints. If opponents continue to pay extra attention to Muhsin Muhammad, Hayes might continue to post some respectable numbers.  Eddie George , RB TEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/14/01 George had his best Fantasy game of the season, posting 132 yards of total offense and a score against Tampa Bay. The performance brings a sigh of relief from Fantasy owners worried that George had lost a step after offseason toe surgery.

"FW:  Move Related Reminders...","
Please be sure that your desk is completely cleaned out and that there is NOTHING left in your area._______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Emissions trading options are ripe for the picking - so how can you make
sure you're ready to profit from GHG?  Let's face it - you can't really

international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per
annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how
you can best seize this exciting nwe market opportunity.  As ever, the

* Weather Trading 2002
  Okura Hotel, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002

Today's business is all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather
derivatives has become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging at
utilities, airlines, and agriculture have at hand to off-set risks
associated with temperature and precipitation.  With over 70% of Europe's
companies facing weather-related risk, knowing about the latest advances in
weather trading is a necessity.

Eyeforenergy's latest event will be run in conjunction with our European
online trading conference, Energy Trading in the New Economy, and
Eyeforenergy's Emissions Trading 2002 event, so you can learn about the
latest developments in energy and emissions trading all under one roof.

* The Business of Fuel Cells for Transportation
  Dearborn Hotel, Detroit, Michigan
  April 30 - May 1, 2002

As manufacturers are increasingly developing technologies with the energy
industry, the auto industry is globalising at an unprecedented rate and both
OEMs and suppliers are renegotiating their alternative vehicle programs.
This event will examine all possible applications in teh transport industry
including synergies with hybrid automobiles and the potentially lucrative
APU market.

Fueling infrastructure will also be covered and, with BP recently launching
Hydrogen fueling stations in Singapore, this issure could not be more timely
or pertinent.  If you have a story to tell, a product to promote or would
simply like to get the full lowdown on the movers and shakers in the
industry then, if you're not already in Detroit, you'll certainly want to be
there in April 2002.

Subject:	Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="""" BridgeEntityName=""EOLBridge"" Message=""Missing StartDate or EndDate"" Status=""F"" BridgeDate=""20011025170945CDT""}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the ""Bid Week"" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

"FW:  IMPORTANT......Workstation Audits for move to ECS","

 
All,

Move time is fast approaching!!!!  IT will be performing a workstation audit on everyone who will be moving to ECS.  This audit is a physical audit of all your IT equipment (computer, telephone, printers, etc.) to document the equipment for each individual.  They will not be accessing the workstation in any way, nor will we power off any workstation.  

IT will begin the workstation audit Wednesday, October 17th around 6:00 pm and will continue for up to 4 consecutive nights (and/or this weekend) to ensure that we identify all equipment.   They will perform these audits after hours so as not to interrupt any daily activities. 

Additionally, with the Churn Freeze already in place, it is important to note that once the audits are performed this week, the information gathered is what will be used to plan for the migration of your IT equipment to ECS.  If changes are made to ANY of the workstations (increase in monitors; CPU upgrades, laptop change, etc.), these will not be captured, and we cannot guarantee these changes will be in place with your move to ECS.  


Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Brandee and Alex

  Question - Andy Neely, San Diego, CA     I've got so much talent at RB I'm not sure who to start this weekend. Marshall Faulk is a no-brainer, but that leaves me to choose among Eddie George, Mike Anderson and Garrison Hearst. Eddie would be my first choice, but he is nursing an injury and going up against a good Tampa Bay defense. Answer - GG     You're right to have doubts about George this week. Hearst has looked good in his last two games, but he's not finding the end zone and continues to split carries with Kevan Barlow. That leaves Anderson, who has the best chance at posting solid Fantasy numbers against a Seattle defense that has been very inconsistent through the first four weeks of the season.  	


  Question - Robert Smith, Philadelphia, PA     I have Frank Wycheck. He has not produced the way I thought he would this year, and his health is uncertain. Should I pick up Erron Kinney or Dwayne Carswell and drop Wycheck?    Answer - GG     Wycheck is dealing with a strained neck, but he's expected to start this weekend against Tampa Bay. Erron Kinney is emerging as a solid pass-catching tight end, but Wycheck is still one of Tennessee's most reliable receiving threats and is far too valuable to simply drop. He's averaged nearly 70 receptions over the past three years and is still a top-tier Fantasy player.  	


  Question - Joe Serodio, Boston, MA     I had Jamal Anderson as my No. 1 back, but ever since his injury I've had to use Jerome Bettis and Thomas Jones as my starters. I was offered Mike Alstott and Priest Holmes for Bill Schroeder. What should I do?    Answer - GG     Depending on the depth of your receivers, we'd suggest making this deal if it's the best trade you can negotiate. Alstott will be Tampa Bay's featured back for at least another week, and Holmes seems to have secured the No. 1 spot in Kansas City with Tony Richardson's recent injury. Schroeder has been a great Fantasy player thus far, but it'll be tough for him to keep up his current pace. While it may be tough to let him go, dealing Schroeder for Alstott and Holmes is the best move you can make to ease the loss of Anderson.  	


    Tip of the Week      Dave Slater, Pittsburgh, PA:  Hines Ward is one of the most underrated receivers in the league. He already has 24 receptions this season, and it's just a matter of time before those receptions turn into touchdowns. Pittsburgh's offense may not be the best, but Ward is the best receiving threat on their roster and will develop into a reliable Fantasy player.

"Oasis Rates","For the past two production months I have had rate issues with Oasis.  I just talked with Marilyn Gilliam and suggested that Natalie Baker be put on a distribution list so Natalie can work on the rates during the month instead of me coming down at the end of the month and needing rates fixed.  I was informed by Marilyn that we were not sending rates to Oasis and that we should be doing this which would help prevent rate discrepancies at the end of the month.  

Mike--if you have any questions about sending the rates to Oasis, you can contact Paul McPheeters at Oasis and he can assist you.

Natalie--this is just an FYI.

Subject:	FW: more humor



Three little boys were concerned because they couldn't get anyone to play with them. They decided it was because they had not been baptized and didn't go to Sunday school. So they went to the nearest church, but only the janitor was there.  
One said, ""We need to be baptized because no one will come out and play with us. Will you baptize us?""  
""Sure,"" said the janitor.  
He took them into the bathroom and dunked their heads in the toilet bowl, one at a time. Then he said, ""Now go out and play.""  
When they got outside, dripping wet, one of them asked, ""What religion do you think we are?""  
The oldest one said, ""We're not Katlick, because they pour the water. We're not Bablist because they dunk all of you. We're not Methdiss because they just sprinkle you.""  
The littlest one said, ""Didn't you smell that water?""  
""Yes. What do you think that means?""  
""That means we're Pisscopalians""

If anyone gives platelets, it would be appreciated.  He has had one
transplant and is on the list for another.  I have worked with him at
Halliburton...  Prayers are definitely needed too.

Amy Brock

	I just found out that that you need to make an appointment to give
platelets.  Call the Blood Donor Center at 713/441-3415 to make an
appointment.


	Dave is continuing to fight his battle with the liver transplant.
Unfortunately, Dave is not doing very well right now.  He is currently in
ICU and is bleeding internally.  Additionally, the disease is attacking his
bone marrow.

	Dave is in need of Blood Platelets.  If anyone wishes to donate,
please call:

	Methodist Hospital
	Dunn Tower
	One behalf of Charles David Conklin
	713-790-3311
	6565 Fannin, Houston, Texas

	Please keep Dave in your thoughts and prayers.

	Steve

All:
From Matt's response it sounds like you might want to specify exception personnel for 8-12, 12 thru 4:00, and 4 thru 6 Normal business hours and not end of the month, holidays or long weekends.

yes, you are correct.  when we watchdog, we'll most likely do VM and Settlements and not PM.  But, in the afternoon, if they need payments out the door, PM will get it.  It goes both ways.  So, if you send me who needs to be in the system no matter what, that would help.  

you are correct, 8-12 is logistics critical, and after that it's anyones guess.

Based on Victor's response, I think there is some confusion.  There are actually several critical time periods depending on the group and time of day.  Perhaps to eliminate the confusion you could specify which time period you are going to watchdog.  I interpreted it to mean the 8-12 AM period but Victor was thinking the afternoon.  Depending on the time there might be different people who should be kicked out.

The critical users on the east desk using path manager will be Meredith Homco, Clarissa Garcia, Christina Sanchez and Victor Lamadrid. If you could alert us as to when y'all are invoking watchdog to kick logistics out, that would be great.  THANKS

Subject:	Unify Exception List

Going forward, as a precautionary measure, we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises.  We will use our Watchdog application in order to initiate this process.  We will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this.  Our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most.

The old list we had from Sybase no longer exists.  I need your help in putting together a new list.  Please provide the list of people who ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL users that have to be on the system.  Obviously, the situation isn't remedied if everyone is an exception user :)

Please provide User Name and Application they need (i.e. Volume Management, Settlements, Path Manager).

The sooner I get this, the sooner we can get this implemented.

Thanks!

Celebrate  Dad this June 17 and check out our  Father's  Day Store  today--if he wants it, we've probably got it, and we've made  it easy for you to find it and get it to him, too.

"NFL.COM FANTASY FOOTBALL NEWSLETTER","
[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  October 19, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports      [IMAGE]NFL.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox at the end of every week. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Fantasy Football Matchups   ? Customize Reports to Display the Info You Want   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  	


    Fantasy Football Matchups     Every Friday our Fantasy experts break down the key Fantasy matchup of the week. It may be a top running back facing a sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a premier cover-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense with ball-hawking safeties. We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups in every NFL game to help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check our Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar) Fridays for Fantasy Football Matchups.  	


    Customize Reports to Display the Info You Want     Did you know you can customize the settings of most reports on the site, and save those settings so they are displayed each time you visit the report? For example, suppose you'd like the Transactions, View report to display only Add/Drops over the past 7 days for all teams. Enter those settings, click GO and then click the Save icon displayed over the report. Now each time you click Transactions, View on the toolbar, the report is displayed according to your custom settings. After you click Save you can click the E-Rept icon to have your new custom report e-mailed to you on the days you choose.  	


	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill  Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins? Answer - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied.  	


  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game.  	


  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player.  	


    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.

     Friday, October 19, 2001 Issue 39   EDITORIAL  Weathering Risk   This week's Briefing is concerned with risk, chiefly that presented by weather in the face of newly deregulated (re-regulated?) energy markets.  Our main feature explains how susceptible the industry has become to increasingly volatile weather, and how the plethora of risks which become presented (include those directly related to earnings) can be alleviated by trading a portfolio of weather derivatives.  We also outline some of the companies who are already emerging as major players in what is already becoming an essential tool for managing financial risk.   On a broader note, our second feature outlines approaches to managing risk in general, and how energy companies can identify and consolidate new opportunities, and reap real financial benefit from minimal risk.   Also, this week saw Eyeforenergy's conference in Singapore, which has been a resounding success.  In a future issue of the Briefing, we will bring you details of events as they unfolded at this three-day meeting of some of the most influential and forward-thinking companies and organizations in the Asian energy market.  For now, you can apply for unlimited access to the speakers' presentations at this conference - more details are available here .   -- Bruno Russell, Acting Editor      FOCUS   Weather is Risky Business for Energy Providers   The pathway to economic oblivion is paved with the bleached bones of those that failed to manage risk. It has been said that economic history is the history of people learning to manage risk. As deregulation takes root, power providers are spreading their reach to the far corners of the globe, in an effort to minimize their risk in any given market.  You don't need a quick trip to Las Vegas to realize that the laws of probability are alive and well in the energy sector. Even the most basic of economic indicators; things that once seemed unpredictable, crop harvest, storms, war, famine, the flow of capital can all be forecast with some degree... Click here for Full Story      INSIGHT   Managing Risk, ""That Old Black Magic""   Headlines coming out of the energy sector are hard to escape. One company reports record profits, another record losses, another goes belly up, yet even more merge, acquire, form alliances, expand, contract and jockey for position as deregulation and increasing competition in energy markets thrust them from a historically stable, low risk environment into a brave new world, full of ever changing risk and opportunities.  Add to the mix shareholders screaming for more profits, consumers demanding lower prices, regulators hell bent on proving deregulation is a myth; there is only re-regulation in a new world order. With this dislocation, the first issue for shareholders and managers of the affected companies to come...

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based group said currently more than half of the electricity produced in the United States comes for power plants that burn coal, with less than 2 percent of the country's electricity coming from renewable sources.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

[IMAGE] Turkeys  and Triumphs: Eight for the Ages     * RICE:  SAME AS HE EVER WAS  It took some adjustment, but Jerry Rice finally found his vintage stride  in a three-touchdown effort in Week 10. His scoring hat trick helped propel  Oakland to a crucial 34-24 win over the San Diego Chargers and kept the  club two games out in front of the AFC West race. ""It was all about learning  the system,"" Rice said. ""Now everything is just automatic. As soon as  Rich (Gannon) makes the call, I know exactly where to go and where to  line up.""  [IMAGE] Flutie  Sucked Into Black Hole     * CAST  YOUR PRO BOWL BALLOTS  Voting is still ongoing to select the players for the 2002 Pro Bowl in  Honolulu.    * BROWN-OUT  IN BALTIMORE  In stunning the Baltimore Ravens, the Cleveland Browns proved two concepts  true. First, that their earlier win over the defending Super Bowl champions  was anything but a fluke. Second, that in spite of a two-week backslide  that witnessed two bitter overtime defeats, the Browns are far from out  of the race in the AFC Central, and stand in solid position as the late-season  playoff chase nears. ""The one thing that this football team never did  is it never stopped believing in itself,"" head coach Butch Davis said  after Cleveland's 27-17 win.

""Matt has had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever he has to prove,"" Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter right now, espec! ia! lly against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he is not expected to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ""There's more to it than just a normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that,"" Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. ""He's injured, and he won't practice this week."" Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Sack Attack Updated 10/16/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/16/01 Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were expected back Tuesday.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/16/01 Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game agains! t ! the Jets, according to the Miami Herald . He should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.  Brian Griese , QB DEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/16/01 The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego, according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Fightin Farmers Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.  Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Okie Pride Updated 10/16/01 Faulk has not been ruled out ! of! Sunday's game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. ""He really could possibly play this week,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""We're not going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out."" If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation throughout the week.   Justin McCareins , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards.   Eddie Berlin , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams,  will be sidelined three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a kickoff return Su! nd! ay.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Browns' head coach Butch Davis told The Akron Plain-Dealer that Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout this week.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Sack Attack Updated 10/16/01 Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.  Marco Battaglia , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is suffering from a strained left shoulder.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/16/01 Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared himself fit enough to play. ""I'm still a little fogg! y,! and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see if I was alive,"" he said, ""but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready.""      Redskins , DT WAS - Okie Pride Updated 10/16/01 Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the injury and is currently listed as day-to-day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as day-to-day.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/16/01 According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Fightin Farmers Upd! at! ed 10/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we expect him to go.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL - Fightin Farmers Updated 10/16/01 Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game.    Reggie Swinton , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as day-to-day.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday. He is expected to miss six weeks of action due to the procedure.    Raghib Ismail , WR DAL - Mud Dogz Updated 10/16/01 Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact Fantasy-wise.    Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Sack Attack Updated 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01! Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would step into the No. 1 RB role once again.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/16/01 Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from playing at full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad idea if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Doug Chapman , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good numbers against a solid Packers' defense.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/16/01 According to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Bennett (ankle) is expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a protective boot on Monday and was walking with a noticeable limp. Doug Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's absence.

It was his only play of the game, which demonstrates how little his Fantasy value is these days.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updat! ed! 10/15/01 The Bears plan to re-sign Matthews possibly on Monday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. He would return to his backup QB job, and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Mike Holmgren has confirmed Trent Dilfer will return to the bench when Seattle plays its next game. Hasselbeck is expected to start against Miami on Oct. 28. ""The plan is still to prepare for Miami with Matt as the guy,"" Holmgren said. Neither player has been a very useful Fantasy starter so far, but Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment, while Dilfer has played mistake-free football.  ! Ma! rk Brunell , QB JAC - WidowMakers Updated 10/15/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches. He is expected to play in Week Six.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/15/01 Smith sprained his right ankle on Sunday against the Jets. The injury is not considered to be serious, and Smith was able to finish the game.  Brian Griese , QB DEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/15/01 Griese re-aggravated a shoulder injury on Sunday at Seattle. The Denver Post says Griese's shoulder will be re-examined on Monday or Tuesday. ""I was able to come back and ! pl! ay this week, and I'm hoping to do the same next week,"" Griese said.  Chad Johnson , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Johnson is expected to miss six weeks with a fractured collarbone. He injured the shoulder in the third quarter of Sunday's game.Ron Dugans might now become Cincinanti's third receiver.   Terry Jackson , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Jackson suffered a calf injury Sunday. He is listed as probable for next week's game at Chicago.   Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Fightin Farm! er! s Updated 10/15/01 The Buffalo News says Johnson (neck)  looked good in practice on Sunday. He is expected to play in Week Six. """"He threw the ball extremely well, especially in the wind today,"" said coach Gregg Williams. ""He had a fresh arm. It seems like there is no residual effect from it right now.""   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Terminators Updated 10/15/01 A hip injury prevented Muhammad from finishing Sunday's game. He is expected to play in next week's game against the Redskins.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/15/01 Mathis shook off a hip injury and played i! n ! Sunday's game. However, a sprained hand limited him to four catches for 50 yards. The hand injury isn't considered to be serious. Mathis will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.   Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Christian suffered bruised ribs in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Sack Attack Updated 10/15/01 Jefferson missed a lot of playing time Sunday because of a sprained left big toe. He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Okie Pride Updated 10/15/01 The St. Louis Rams will be without Faulk for at least one week. The Rams originally diagnosed the injury as a sprained right medial collateral ligament, but an MRI revealed no severe ligament or cartilage damage.   Rams coach Mike Martz fears that Faulk may be sidelined for at least three weeks.   ""They (the doctors) think he will be out somewhere between three to four weeks,"" Martz said. Faulk will be re-evaluated next week and believes it is possible he could return for a key NFC West game against the New Orleans Saints on October 28.   ""We'll see,"" Faulk said. ""It's kind of early to say, but you never know.""     Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Weinke continued to struggle Sunday, fumbling away the center exchange on Carolina's second posse! ss! ion, losing another fumble when his arm was hit as he attempted to pass and also throwing an interception. All three turnovers led to Saints scores, putting Carolina down 17-0. He finished 21-of-39 for 196 yards and two second-half touchdowns. Use him as a reserve for now.    Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/14/01 Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical silence,  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33 carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even when Ricky Watters returns.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and is no better than a reserve at this point.   Lamar Smith ,! R! B MIA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Sack Attack Updated 10/14/01 Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a roster spot.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Terminators Updated 10/14/01  Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right.   Glyn Milburn , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will be re-evaluated on Monday.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/14/01 Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider droppin! g ! Bennett altogether.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/14/01 Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Batch had a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three scores. He's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the performance, but he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Franks caught only two passes for four yards against the Ravens, but both catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as a primary goal-line threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.  David Patten , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Patten had a good game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73 yards. He'll likely be pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry Glenn is back, so don't be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat.   Antonio Freeman , WR GB - Fighti! n ! Farmers Updated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this week.  Travis Taylor , WR BAL - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. The second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltimore passing game.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc   FB10NF

"FERC Staff to Monitor Pipes for OFO Abuses","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : October 12, 2001
FERC Staff to Monitor Pipes for OFO Abuses 
This represents a new kind of approach by the Commission to the market, ""which is that we're acting not reacting,"" said Commissioner Nora Brownell. The creation of this mechanism does not necessarily mean FERC has seen a ""pattern of abuse"" by pipelines that would warrant ""more vigorous pursuit"" of OFO activity, she noted. ""We are simply setting up the mechanisms by which we will know them [OFO abuses] when we see them and be able to deal with them."" 
In a discussion paper issued at Thursday's regular FERC meeting, Gary Mahrenholz of the Office of Markets Rates and Tariffs said FERC staff would rely largely on electronic bulletin board (EBB) postings, pipeline reports and others sources to oversee OFO activity on the pipelines. 
The Commission is taking this action on top of the OFO remedies that were ordered in Order 637, which included requiring pipelines to file OFO activity reports, set proper OFO penalty levels and credit revenues to shippers, timely inform shippers of OFOs, and to improve pipeline-specific OFO definitions. 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt was concerned that FERC was acting before it knew the results of its Order 637 remedies with respect to OFOs. ""...I do believe that it is prudent to allow some time for revisions to OFO procedures that we required in 637 to work. The 637 initiative required pipelines to find a way to minimize the issuance of OFOs and to provide data as to OFOs [that] are invoked."" She further noted that over-reliance on OFOs was not an industry-wide problem, but rather was confined to specific pipelines. 
Pipelines mostly invoke OFOs during peak-demand periods, particularly during cold periods, to keep their systems operating reliably. During an OFO, shippers are restricted in the amount of gas they can purchase and transport. When shippers are out of balance on a pipeline during an OFO -- meaning that they have put more gas into a pipeline's system than their customers will take out at the other end, or haven't put in enough gas to cover their customers -- they are assessed penalties by pipelines. 
Shippers routinely have complained that pipeline-declared OFOs lasted too long and affected too large a portion of a pipeline's system; that pipelines favored their marketing affiliates when an OFO was in effect; and that OFO measures were poorly defined, giving pipelines significant latitude as to when to declare emergency orders. 
Although Order 637 dealt with many of the shippers' complaints about OFOs, FERC believes the monitoring activity is essential to determine if pipes are using OFOs to inhibit competition and reduce service quality, as well as to assess where capacity expansions are most needed. 
""The new [637] procedures together with more effective monitoring should limit the issuance of OFOs to times when they are absolutely necessary to maintain service reliability,"" according to FERC staff's discussion paper.

    Thursday, May 31, 2001 Issue 29   EDITORIAL  Today and Tomorrow-what Asia faces and what we've all learned from the past  As you probably know, the Eyeforenergy team is off to Mexico next week for our Latin American e-business in energy conference.  But to prove that our interests are global, our Insight article this week focuses on the state of the energy in Asia.  Like their colleagues in Latin America, Europe and North America, energy executives in Asia are facing a host of changes-e-business, regulatory changes, and the commercialization of alternative and micro energy sources.  All of these are examined in the article below, and it paints an interesting picture of the state of play in Asia today and what sort of challenges they face tomorrow.   In other news, the move towards online trading continues apace in the energy industry (unlike recent developments in most other industries) with announcements by Pantellos and Duke Energy North America.  Pantellos' move into the international arena with its procurement solution points towards the increasing use of online marketplaces in the energy supply chain (or at least a refusal to give up in the wake of Petrocosm's demise).      While Duke's announcement of their move to OpenLink's software points towards the increasing use of Internet technology on the commodity side of energy trading.   Either way, the energy sector seems to be one of the few bright spots in the wake of the dot com gloom. The energy industry's measured response and refusal to jump on the e-commerce bandwagon at the start seems to be proving dividends now.  Perhaps the rest of the new economy is learning what it seemed that the energy industry always knew-the Internet is just another tool (a useful one, but just a tool) and at the end of the day you still need to get the oil out of the ground and the electricity to the customers.         Q&A   Mirroring the Marketplace   Founded in late 1997, Excelergy Corporation, Lexington, Mass., a developer of software products and technologies for online energy marketplaces, is one of several companies providing products and services in this arena.  Recently, eyeforenergy contacted Jay Sherry, vice president of global marketing, to discuss hybrid business models and approaches and the issues that face those trying to implement them.  Hybrid approaches to conducting e-commerce transactions online are rapidly finding a home in the retail energy space.  Such approaches are not being implemented for altruistic reasons; instead, for some, it's become the means to survival.  Determining other uses for existing technological expertise... Click here for Full Story      FOCUS   E-procurement- is it so much more than buying and selling goods and services online?   E-procurement involves companies buying their supplies online. As B2B e-commerce has become the next big thing in the corporate world. The chief beneficiaries of this trend are a growing list of software vendors, like Ariba and WebMethods, which provide applications that enable electronic procurement and also create Web-based trading communities.  In recent years, many Internet commerce procurement application offerings have come to market addressing the automation and economics of the procurement process. Service companies have begun to implement e-procurement applications and consult around the entire e-procurement process. Outsourcers... Click here for Full Story     Fuel Cell and Microturbine Roundup   The energy wires have been humming this past week with word of new and exciting technologies from the world of distributed generation, fuel cells, microturbines, solar photovoltaic and wind. Word of increased rolling brownouts and power interruptions in the west and pressure from environmental groups concerned over co2 emissions are shining the light on renewable energy sources as the world gears up to make sure the stream of power continues unabated.  With the dot-com meltdown in full swing venture capitalists in search of the ""next big thing,"" are casting their eye on the energy sector. If you listen carefully you will be able to hear the words of an old song drifting on the wind, ""Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends, we're so... Click here for Full Story      INSIGHT   Energy Opportunities in the Asia Pacific Region   With e-commerce in the Asia sector poised to explode, reaching 28 percent of the world's total by 2005, it's small wonder that the region has a firm eye on energy. B2B Internet commerce in the Asia/Pacific region (including Japan) reached US 96.8 billion in 2000 or 22 percent of the worldwide total of US $433.3 billion.  The Asia Pacific region has enjoyed a rapid economic expansion in recent decades with a corresponding demand for electricity. This has placed a severe strain on the ability of individual economies in the area to expand their electricity infrastructure capacity rapidly enough to meet the surge in...

"Bosses Day","Hi All-

Was thinking of doing a gift certificate to Mark's (a really great restaurant in Montrose) for Bob for Bosses day so he and Carolyn can have a night out.  If we each kick in $15, that will give us $120--am thinking that we could do a $100 GC, then I'll pick up a NYRangers shirt when I'm home this weekend with the other $20, or we could just do a $125 GC, whatever you guys want.  I've got a card for everyone to sign as well.  Any other suggestions are of course welcome--but either way, plese get me your $$ by the end of the day today since I'll run over there this afternoon and get the GC if we all agree on that.

Thanks,
Suzanne

'On-line Exchanges Evolve'
-------------------------
Entering the new millennium, energy companies are being forced to do business in new ways. Tough environmental legislation, product price sensitivity, mergers and acquisitions, downsizing, supply shortages, and profitability pressures all pose significant challenges to the energy industry as a whole. However, nothing poses more of a challenge than the Internet revolution.

"Join me on Tuesday October 30th at Romano's Macaroni Grill","Hello again.  Thanks to those of you that have RSVP'd for our event.  If you
haven't and you would like to attend, please let us know.  We would love to
have you join us!

After what had already been a difficult year for you as an investor, the
tragic September 11 events only added to our concern for financial recovery.
While we certainly can't control events around us and the impact they have
on our investments, it is still important to remember that we must look past
short-term effects on the markets and think of our long-term goals.

We would like to invite you to join us for an evening out to talk candidly
about how we all must feel right now, the current market conditions, and
steps that we need to take to help us reach our financial goals.

We will address The Three E's - Emotions, Expectations and Economics:

? How to cope with investment emotions
? Education on asset allocation
? Education on long-term investing

Please join us for our Market Outlook Seminar, to be held on Tuesday October
30th from 6:30 to 7:45 at Romano's Macaroni Grill at 1155 Lake Woodlands
Drive in The Woodlands.  We encourage you to bring a guest - in fact, we
will have drawings for some free giveaways for clients that bring guests!

You will have the opportunity to hear Allen Kuhn, Regional Vice President of
Franklin Templeton Investments, discuss the current market and what you need
to be aware of for the future.  Also, we have a new assistant for you to
meet, Karen.  Karen came to work with us last October.  Some of you may have
already had an opportunity to talk with her.

Call Kathy at 281.367.8658 ext. 2234 soon to make your reservations, since
seats are limited. I look forward to seeing you soon.

"NFL.com E-Reports for Bammel Football League 10/19/01","
[IMAGE] 	
 Visa has teamed up with NFL players Brett Favre, Emmitt Smith, and Jerome Bettis to give you a chance to win all your Visa purchases! Find out more at: http://www.visa.com/nfl   You are receiving these e-reports because you have signed up for NFL Fantasy Football.  To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  Latest NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM  Trent Green , QB KC - Fightin Farmers Updated 10/18/01 Green should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week!   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB IND - Bloomin Idiots Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Fightin Farmers Updated 10/18/01  Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect h! im! to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Mud Dogz Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.  Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Sack Attack Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin  , RB NYJ - Sack Attack Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bloomin Idiots Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - WidowMakers Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Terminators Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a g! oo! d start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.   Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Terminators Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Mud Dogz Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy ! pe! rspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Canidate will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Sack Attack Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Okie Pride Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Mud Dogz Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - WidowMakers Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

 Desk Managers,

I wanted to follow-up from the staff meeting this week on the item to get a representative from each of the desks, who will be the designated tester in addition to Richard.   Please respond with that person name.

Matt,

It would be helpful to all us to know when you will need these resources so we can manage the workload.

Importance:	High

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I would like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choose, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordination efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening for a while though.

[IMAGE] Week  16 Game-by-Game Analysis     * NO  LION DOWN  When Matt Millen left the broadcast booth to take over as  president/CEO of the Lions, he never envisioned encountering as  much frustration and disappointment as he has over the past four  months. ""It's the hardest thing I've done yet in football,"" a  candid Millen told NFL Insider's Vic Carucci in an exclusive  interview. ""I'm as emotional as when I played, but there's nowhere  for it to go. It stays right in your chest.""    * THE  CATCH OF A LIFETIME  In 1982, the 49ers got a gift that has lived on for nearly 20 years.  When Joe Montana found Dwight Clark in the end zone, it sparked a  dynasty that is still rolling today. Take a look back as NFL Insider  remembers the championship game that produced ""The Catch.""

But in fourth-quarter and overtime  situations where the margin between the two teams is three points  or fewer, kickers have connected on just 70.4 percent of their attempts.  Those numbers demonstrate just how pressure can have an adverse effect  on even the best kickers.

"FW: Logistics Commercial Realignment","

After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

"Save 70% on Perscription Strength, Professional Teeth Whitening!","
	[IMAGE]		[IMAGE]	
	[IMAGE]  [IMAGE] Professional Teeth Whitening has brought professional strength teeth whitening out of the dentist office and provides it at a reasonable price. For years dentists have enjoyed a monopoly on professional strength teeth whitening because of a law that allows only dentists to take impressions of other people's teeth. With the advent of high tech impression material that allows a person to take a flawless impression of their own teeth, Professional Teeth Whitening has been able to offer these once-reserved products to the public at an affordable price.   The procedure is very simple. An impression is taken the same way dentists do. After successfully taking your impression, it is mailed to Precision Dental Arts, where they fabricate a custom mouthpiece - made the same way dentists do. Five to ten days later, your custom mouthpieces will be delivered to your door.  The mouthpieces are used with whitener that is the same name brands and professional strength used by dentists. You will achieve a white smile by a process that is more convenient and 2-to-6 times less costly than from your dentist.  To take advantage of this spectacular offer, click on the ""Order Here"" button below.  	[IMAGE]

Subject: FW: Things it takes around fifty years to  learn......
1. Never under any circumstances take a sleeping pill and a laxative on  the 
same night. 
2. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason  why the human race has not 
achieved, and never will achieve, its full  potential, that word would be 
""meetings."" 
3. There is a very fine  line between ""hobby"" and ""mental illness."" 
4. People who want to share  their religious views with you almost never want 
you to share yours with  them. 
5. And when God, who created the entire universe with all of its  glories, 
decides to deliver a message to humanity, He WILL NOT use, as His  messenger, 
a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle. 
6. You should  not confuse your career with your life. 
7. No matter what happens,  somebody will find a way to take it too seriously. 
8. When trouble  arises and things look bad, there is always one individual 
who perceives a  solution and is willing to take command.  Very often, that 
individual  is crazy. 
9. Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and  dance. 
10. Never lick a steak knife. 
11. Take out the fortune  before you eat the cookie. 
12. The most powerful force in the universe  is gossip. 
13. You will never find anybody giving a clear and compelling  reason why we 
observe daylight savings time. 
14. You should never  say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that 
you think she's  pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her 
at that moment.  
15. There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to  make a 
big deal about your birthday.  That time is age eleven.  
16. ""The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age,  gender, 
religion, economic status, or ethnic background, is that, deep down  inside, 
we ALL believe that we are above average drivers. 
7. The  main accomplishment of almost all organized protests is to annoy 
people who  are not in them. 
18. A person who is nice to you, but rude to the  waiter, is not a nice person. 
19. Your friends love you anyway.  
Thought for the day: Never be afraid to try something new.   Remember, 
Amateurs built the Ark... Professionals built the Titanic.

"Cornboys","
Hi,
 
Lunch ------- I'm free any of those days.  Whichever is easiest for you. I just need a few hours notice.
 
I'm glad you enjoyed your vacation.  Soccer coach huh. I'd be looking to get even on that one.
 
I, of course, have a few zillion  questions re Enron --- we can save those for lunch.
 
Now I know you have gone home by the time  I write this on Friday before the BIG game between the BCS #1 and the soon to be  named #1 CORNHUSKERS. I did need to state the outcome before the game. (Of  course I have eaten much crow in past years).
 
Later,
Ken

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

"Daren, get your American flag!","[IMAGE]
[IMAGE]	


 Dear Daren:  From out of something as horrific as the events of September 11th has come something truly amazing - a growing sense of patriotism in America not felt for decades.   We've felt it here at iWon - in fact, we've had numerous iWon members write to us and ask if iWon sold American Flags. They've been hard to come by recently, but now, through the cooperation of The National Flag & Display Company, we're proud to offer American Flag Kits to our members.  Each kit includes one (1) 3' x 5' polyester flag, 3-piece 6' pole, styrene eagle and mounting bracket.    Click here to order your American Flag Kit  - and show your pride in our nation!    Thank you, The iWon Team 	[IMAGE]

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

RENEWABLE ENERGY FACT SHEETS

UNEPs Energy Programme addresses the environmental consequences of energy
production and use, such as global climate change and local air pollution.
It assists decision-makers in government and the private sector to make
better, more informed energy choices which fully integrate environmental and
social costs.

One of the areas UNEP Energy (www.uneptie.org) is concerned with is
renewable energy issues, and has published a series of Renewable Energy
Technology fact sheets on various types of renewable energies.

"June 22 - Gas Storage Conference - Register Today!","
Register before Friday June 1 and save $100 ! 
Is current storage fill giving us 
a false sense of security? 
It's May. And those AGA storage numbers might have us feeling pretty secure about the future. But a lot can happen in a few short months. Consider these likely scenarios:
This summer hot or hotter than last summer? Predictions abound. 
Record number of new gas fired electric generation units on-line this summer, increasing demand and the draw on storage. 
Severe drought affecting hydropower, the lowest output in 30 years. 
Natural gas supply availability virtually unchanged from last year's levels.                        Fact or fiction?

?       
Attend Ziff Energy's new storage conference and find out what  North American experts have to say. 
Storage 2001-2002: 
A Source of Stability or Chaos? 
June 22, 2001- Houston

Free Opera in the Park featuring Houston Grand Opera's Carmen, June 8-10!
Houston Grand Opera's sensational Multimedia Modular Stage production returns for three FREE performances at Houston's Miller Outdoor Theatre on June 8-10 at 8:30 p.m. Bizet's fiery gypsy Carmen, everybody's favorite femme fatale, ignites the summer in a powerhouse production that had audiences and critics cheering when it was first unveiled in 1998.

Houston Grand Opera's revolutionary Multimedia Modular Stage (MMS), with its giant ""live"" video screens, hydraulic platforms, and hundreds of rotating, colored lights takes the incredible energy onstage and transports it to the farthest reaches of the outdoor venue with a visceral impact equal to that of a rock concert!

Tickets for the reserved seating will be issued between the hours of 11:30am and 1:00pm through the Miller Theatre box office on the day of the performance.  Any remaining tickets will be issued one hour before the performance.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Subject: Best Church Web Sites and Best Practices


I have taken the assignment of gathering information about best practices
for church web sites for the Communications Task Force at Bammel.  I am
interested in hearing from each of you regarding your all-time favorite
church web sites.  These sites do not have to be published by churches of
Christ.

""Best practices"" is a phrase that kept recurring in the first Task Force
meeting on Saturday, June 2.  This would seem to include:
""Essential"" content (i.e.., maps, service times, etc.)
Privacy concerns (How do we provide great information without compromising
the privacy of our members?)
What sort of content would make Bammel stand out as a superior site?  (I am
not talking about look and feel, just information.)
Your own pet peeves about church web sites.  I figure that you are
representative of what others will think and probably more critical than
most.

Feel free to recruit opinions from other sources.  Send me links.  Express
yourself, but please respond as quickly as possible.  The time is very short
for gathering this information; it must be collected, analyzed and condensed
into notes for the elders by the end of June!  This means that I really need
to hear from you this week, if possible, and the sooner the better.

Thank you for your help in this effort.  Our hope is that we will dream
God-sized dreams so that He will be glorified.

Michael Olsen in Texas Logistics is receiving statements from Volume Mgmt for Blue Dolphin Pipeline.  Mike is fairly sure that Blue Dolphin went with HPL.  Is that correct or do we still have some business on it?

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm

"RE:","There are two ENA contracts with Blue Dolphin - FT and IT and one for ENAU.  Were both of the contracts assigned?  In Global, the only contracts that show as assigned to AEP are  Global # 96032498 (ENA - FT) and Global #96063862 (ENAU - IT).  

The other contract Global#96037499 still shows as an active contract for ENA and the pipe continues to invoice us.

Taking into account that Global may be wrong, is there something that either of you have with the assigned global numbers so that we can get Global updated and notify the pipe?

Bob, 

Michael Olsen in Texas Logistics is receiving statements from Volume Mgmt for Blue Dolphin Pipeline.  Mike is fairly sure that Blue Dolphin went with HPL.  Is that correct or do we still have some business on it?

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

Subject:	Bosses Day
Importance:	High

Hi All-

Was thinking of doing a gift certificate to Mark's (a really great restaurant in Montrose) for Bob for Bosses day so he and Carolyn can have a night out.  If we each kick in $15, that will give us $120--am thinking that we could do a $100 GC, then I'll pick up a NYRangers shirt when I'm home this weekend with the other $20, or we could just do a $125 GC, whatever you guys want.  I've got a card for everyone to sign as well.  Any other suggestions are of course welcome--but either way, plese get me your $$ by the end of the day today since I'll run over there this afternoon and get the GC if we all agree on that.

Thanks,
Suzanne

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

"Logistics Commercial Realignment","
After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

"","Two quick questions...

Volume Management seems to think that we had business on Blue Dolphin Pipeline for August 2001.  I told them that we had none, and that whatever they have is AEP business.  They insisted that it was ours and sent down Allocation Statements from Blue Dolphin.  WE have nothing in the system, so I have no idea what to say to them beyond what I think is the case, that AEP has this business now.

As for the Industrial research, I got your message and I assume I should focus on the ones on the map.  The map has 17 plants listed with pipeline connects.  I will call them for capacities and flexibility.

All errors were taken care of by Jay and I with little trouble.

Thanks.

With regards to the Path Manager rewrite, as we make changes, we'll let you know.  I don't have a timeframe just yet, but we'll let you know when we're ready.  I'll give you plenty of warning.

 Desk Managers,

I wanted to follow-up from the staff meeting this week on the item to get a representative from each of the desks, who will be the designated tester in addition to Richard.   Please respond with that person name.

Matt,

It would be helpful to all us to know when you will need these resources so we can manage the workload.  

Regards,

Tammy

Subject:	Path Manager Rewrite / Optimization project
Importance:	High

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I would like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choose, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordination efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening for a while though.

"United Way 2000 Contribution Reminder","During our United Way 2000 Campaign that was held last fall, you were kind enough to pledge a contribution to the United Way. Our records indicate that your preference was to pay by check.  If you have already paid your contribution, thank you!  If you have not, we wanted to provide you with the information that you need in order to send in your contribution.

All checks should be made out to the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast.  They can be sent interoffice mail in a confidential envelope to the attention of Zulie Flores, EB 1612.  If for some reason, you do not know the amount that you pledged, you can call Zulie at 
3-3908 and she will be able to assist you.

We had such a successful campaign last year and it was due in large part to your generosity.  Thank you for your support of this very important program - you did make a difference!

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"NFL.com E-Reports for Bammel Football League 10/18/01","
[IMAGE] 	
 Visa has teamed up with NFL players Brett Favre, Emmitt Smith, and Jerome Bettis to give you a chance to win all your Visa purchases! Find out more at: http://www.visa.com/nfl   You are receiving these e-reports because you have signed up for NFL Fantasy Football.  To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  Latest NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM   Redskins , DT WAS - Okie Pride Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Terminators Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few ! sh! ots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective. !   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Sack Attack Updated 10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.    Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR M! IN! - Pongo Pack Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Mud Dogz Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Sunday at ! Sa! n Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Terminators Updated 10/17/01 Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Mud Dogz Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - WidowMakers Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does ! pl! ay. Brady only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Sack Attack Updated 10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team. Larry F! os! ter assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Pongo Pack Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry  , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.  Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Buffalo News says the Bills want to get Riemersma more involved in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are healthy again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the year, but he will now become more involved in the passing game.  Jerom! e ! Pathon , WR IND - Bloomin Idiots Updated 10/17/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this week against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reggie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Herald says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with stress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Mud Dogz Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning Star, Smith could end up splitting more carrie! s ! with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each other very well, and that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Alexander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to the injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionable, but he is expected to play.   Greg Clark, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Clark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on his right hamstring three weeks ago. ""It was encouraging,"" Clark told the Contra Costa Times. ""I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of that before the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I could do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in comparison."" Head Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game against Chicago.    More Updates  Player News&n! bs! p;Teams    Fightin Farmers Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM  Joey Galloway , Active WR Updated 10/17/01 Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined.   Rob Johnson , Reserve QB Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.  Bill Schroeder , Reserve WR Updated 10/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we expect him to go.   Derrick Alexander , Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01 Alexander overcame back problems to play against the Steelers, but was held to just one catch for 10 yards. Injuries and lack of effective complements have rendered Alexander a disappointment so far this season.  Antonio Freeman , Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this week.  James Allen , Reserve RB Updated 10/14/01 Allen had a solid game on Sunday, rushing for 75 yards and a touchdown. However, the performance is a bit tainted Fantasy-wise since it was against a weak Arizona defensive front. Don't expect thos type of numbers from the Bears' tailback on a weekly basis.   Ahman Green , Active RB Updated 10/12/01 Green has been one of the best backs in the league thus far, but he could struggle against Baltimore's vaulted defense. If you have a deep group of running backs, you may want to consider reserving the Packers' tailback.   Byron Chamberlain , Reserve TE Updated 10/12/01 Chamberlain has quickly become one of the key weapons in the Vikings' passing game, and he is a reliable weekly Fantasy starter. Expect another good outing this weekend against Detroit.   Trent Green , Active QB Updated 10/12/01 Green might have another bad week. Pittsburgh's defense will pressure him often, and the Chiefs will be less effective in the air without the injured Derrick Alexander.  Oronde Gadsden , Active WR Updated 10/12/01 Gadsden should find himself in position to catch a TD pass against the Jets. Miami will score often against the New York defense.  Mike Anderson , Active RB Updated 10/12/01 Expect excellent numbers from Anderson this week. He always plays well against Seattle, and the Seahawks still lack the talent to stop him from gaining big chunks of yardage as the game wears on.  Jerome Bettis , Active RB Updated 10/11/01 Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice to allow a minor knee injury to heal. He is expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable.   Fred Taylor , Reserve RB Updated 10/11/01 The Jaguars have ruled Taylor out for their next game against Buffalo on October 18. Taylor is still recovering from the groin injury he suffered in Week Two.   Broncos , Active DT Updated 08/23/01 Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, who suffered a slight ligament tear in his knee during Monday's preseason game, is expected to be ready for the start of the regular season. Denver's defense has the talent to be a solid unit from a Fantasy perspective, and will be one of the top ten defenses taken on Draft Day.   Wade Richey , Active K Updated 04/20/01 The Chargers signed ex-49er placekicker Wade Richey on Wednesday, when the kicker's former team did not match the offer sheet San Diego tendered last week. With the 24-year-old Richey in, incumbent kicker John Carney will most likely leave the team.   Joe Nedney , Reserve K Updated 03/07/01 The Tennessee Titans on Tuesday reached a contract agreement with Nedney, an unrestricted free agent who played most of the 2000 season with the Carolina Panthers. The five-year veteran will replace longtime Titans kicker Al Del Greco, who was cut last week after a poor postseason performance and for salary cap reasons. Nedney converted 26 of 28 field-goals attempts and all 20 of his extra-point tries for 98 points last season.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc   FB10NF

For most  bugs, it's very short--sometimes just a few weeks. Lots of  butterflies, for example, live a month or two, but others live a  year or so. Some insects have a long juvenile stage and a brief  adulthood. One of the weirdest is the cicada. They spend maybe 13  years underground feeding on tree roots, then when they're the right  size and age, they crawl out of the ground, affix themselves to the  bark of trees, split out of their skin and emerge as an adult. In  the next two days, they mate and die. Imagine: 13 years of  childhood, one day of sex, then death.

"October 12 ENW Meeting","I realize that the timing of the Enron Net Works All Employee Meeting last Friday made it difficult for the Gas Logistics Team to attend.  For future all-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees.  I didn't want you to be left out in this case, so I have worked with Bob Superty to set up another meeting for the Logistics team so that we can share with you the information that was covered last Friday.  I hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting.  We have two videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that I think you will enjoy seeing.  We will also review the slides that were used in the discussions and have time for questions and answers.

How to Patch Chipped and Pitted Concrete[IMAGE] Every spring, the effects of the past winter's freeze show up in the form of new cracks and chips in your concrete driveways and walkways. If you have an older property, the damage can get pretty ugly, but you don't always need to call in a professional to deal with it. As hard a material as concrete is, with the right tools and a little bit of know-how, it isn't that difficult to work with and repair. Check out this thorough  guide  from American Handyman magazine for the lowdown on how to shape up your concrete without breaking the bank.

Do-It-Yourself Tip 
[IMAGE]A new patch in an old concrete driveway or sidewalk can really stick out like a sore thumb. Getting a good finish match just takes a little patience and a soft-bristled push broom. After you've poured the concrete in the patch hole and worked the surface smooth with a wood float, wait around as it dries (this is the part that requires patience). When the new patch has hardened enough so that it's tough to put a dent in the surface with your finger, spray a fine mist of water over the top and gently scrub away the surface cream with your soft broom until the aggregate appears. If the old concrete shows larger aggregate, you'll have to scrub harder to match it. To take the fresh white color out of your patch, trying washing the surface with a little cola after it has hardened for a day. Odd as it sounds, the acidic nature of the soft drink often does the trick.

Wendy, Richard please coordinate how the scheduled quantities turn on/off will work

Yes - on an ongoing basis, we will be running a mass draft on the night of the 15th each month.  We also have reporting requirements for the last day of the month, but our normal draft process will cover that.  Let me know if you have more questions.  Thanks.

 Desk Managers,

I wanted to follow-up from the staff meeting this week on the item to get a representative from each of the desks, who will be the designated tester in addition to Richard.   Please respond with that person name.

Matt,

It would be helpful to all us to know when you will need these resources so we can manage the workload.

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I would like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choose, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordination efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening for a while though.

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Going forward, as a precautionary measure, we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises.  We will use our Watchdog application in order to initiate this process.  We will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this.  Our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most.

The old list we had from Sybase no longer exists.  I need your help in putting together a new list.  Please provide the list of people who ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL users that have to be on the system.  Obviously, the situation isn't remedied if everyone is an exception user :)

Please provide User Name and Application they need (i.e. Volume Management, Settlements, Path Manager).

The sooner I get this, the sooner we can get this implemented.

Thanks!

Subject:	Bosses Day
Importance:	High

Hi All-

Was thinking of doing a gift certificate to Mark's (a really great restaurant in Montrose) for Bob for Bosses day so he and Carolyn can have a night out.  If we each kick in $15, that will give us $120--am thinking that we could do a $100 GC, then I'll pick up a NYRangers shirt when I'm home this weekend with the other $20, or we could just do a $125 GC, whatever you guys want.  I've got a card for everyone to sign as well.  Any other suggestions are of course welcome--but either way, plese get me your $$ by the end of the day today since I'll run over there this afternoon and get the GC if we all agree on that.

Thanks,
Suzanne

"What is the market doing now","The stock market sprang back a bit this spring in April and earlier in May.
And while the market gave back those gains at the end of May, we're still
positive about prospects for the rest of 2001. Here's how things look for
the year and recent month:

	6/1/00	1/2/01	5/1/01	5/31/01	% chg.
Yr.	% chg.
YTD	% chg.
May '01
Dow Jones	10,652	10,787	10,898	10,912	2%	1%	0%
S&P 500	1,449	1,320	1,266	1,256	-13%	-5%	-1%
Nasdaq	3,582	2,471	2,168	2,110	-41%	-15%	-3%
* does not include reinvested dividends

Dan Laufenberg, American Express Financial Corporation's chief economist,
says investors have several reasons to be optimistic long term. These
include:

*	Continued interest rate cuts - The Federal Reserve cut rates yet
another half a percent in May, for a total reduction of 2.50% so far this
year. Historically, such cuts have taken a few months to affect the economy
and market - but the eventual result has often been a substantial upturn for
both.

*	Newly passed tax cuts - Congress has passed a $1.35 trillion,
wide-ranging tax-cut package that should put extra dollars into U.S.
consumers' pockets soon. That, in turn, could eventually boost corporate
profits and stock prices.

*	Signs of a strengthening economy - The upturn in stocks this spring,
continued rate cuts and the prospect of lower taxes all helped boost
consumer confidence in May. The New York-based Conference Board said its
Consumer Confidence Index jumped in May to 115.5 from 109.9 - more than
economists expected. The rise in confidence is important since consumers are
a major driver of the U.S. economy.

Dan Laufenberg says these positive developments support his forecast of
stronger economic growth - and potential stock market improvement - through
the rest of the year. However, he adds that the economy remains vulnerable
and volatility could continue, so a long-term investment focus is best.

I'll keep you informed as economic and market developments continue. Thank
you for your loyalty and understanding as we ride out this market
correction.

Best regards,








""Make all you can, save all you can, give all you can.""
