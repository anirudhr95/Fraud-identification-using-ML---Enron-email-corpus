Bruce,

given that Enron Europe has no relationship to speak of with Ashursts, I would not find it surprising. We have used them historically. One partner was very strong in UK gas. He left more than a year ago and since then we have not used them. We do not therefore have a relationship which would allow us to exert any influence over them.

Rob/Mark -

Would we find this surprising given any relationship that Enron has (or doesn't have) with Ashursts?

"RE: Thursday General Counsel Call","Thanks for the input, Rob.  Julia has already gone through the Enron Europe and Enron Wind interview processes.  She speaks excellent English, as well as German.  In addition to myself and Chris Wood, she was interviewed by an Enron Wind German lawyer (who has left and she is replacing), an Enron Corp. German lawyer, and by a German lawyer from Punder.  The feedback is unanimously positive.  I think I have run all of the interview traps in Europe, and am confident that she will be a real asset to our department and to the Enron Wind Europe team.

SUBJECT; RE:INTRODUCTION OF (OAHED)AND REQUEST FOR
FINANCIAL/TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR EFFECTIVE TAKE-OFF
OF ESTABLISHING A LIAISON OFFICE  IN THE GAMBIA.

ATTN:JAMES

INTRODUCTION
*Organization of African Health and Economic
Development (OAHED), was created with a vision to
coordinates efforts to combat diseases and promote
physical and mental health. Contribute significantly
to eradicate communicable diseases and promoting
improved sanitation and health condition in Africa and
promote economic development.
*OAHED based on a common vision on economic
stabilization strategies and shared conviction , that
(OAHED) have  a pressing duty  to eradicate poverty
and diseases and to place Africa countries both
individually and collectively on the path of
sustainable growth development at the same time
participate actively in the world economy.
*The programmme of (OAHED) is anchored on the
determination  of Africans to extricate themselves and
the continent from the malaise of underdevelopment and
exclusion in the world globalization.
*Poverty and backwardness of African stand in stark
contrast to the prosperity of the developed world.The
continued imagination of Africa from the globalisaton
process and the social exclusion of the vast majority
of its people constitute a serious threat to global
stability.
*In Africa, 365 million peoples or half of the
population live on less than $1.00 per day.The
mortality rate of children under 5years of age is 140
per 1000 and life expectancy at birth is only 54
years. Only 41 percent of the population have access
to safe water, medical care, education etc. The high
rate of illiteracy for people over 15 is 54 percent.
*OAHED calls for the reversal of this abnormal
situation by changing the relationship that underpins
it.African are appealing neither for the further
entrenchment of dependency through aid, nor for
margical concession.
*We are convinced that an historical opportunity
present itself to end the scourge of underdevelopment
that afflicts Africa. The resources, including
capital, technology and human skills that are required
to launch a global war on poverty and underdevelopment
exist in abundance.What is required to mobilize these
resource and use them properly, is bold and
imaginative leadership that is genuinely committed to
a sustained effort of human upliftment and poverty
eradication as well as a new global partnership based
on shared responsibility and mutual interest.
*In the circumstance, Organization of African Health
and Economic Development(OAHED) hereby declare that we
will no longer allow ourselves/African countries to be
conditioned by circumstances. We determine our own
destiny and call on the rest of the world to help and
complement our efforts. There are already signs of
progress and hopes. Democratic regimes that are
committed to the protection of human rights, peoples
centered development and market oriented economies are
on the increase. African people have begun to
demonstrate their refusal to accept poor economic and
political leadership.These development are,  however
uneven and inadequate and head to be further
expedited.
OAHED is about consolidating and accelerating these
gains. It is a call  for a new relationship of
partnership  between African and the international
community, especially the highly industrialised
countries, to overcome the development chasm that has
of course widened over centuries of unequal relations.
*Our perfect knowledge in respect of the high level of
your commitment and goodness in the vineyard of
humanity impressed and impelled us to seek for your
kind assistance to establish the (OAHED) liaison
office in the Gambia.
The materials and funds needed for the effective
take-off are as follow:
1.Cost of renting /furnishing
office??????????.USD$38,000.00
2.Logistics, ie, vehicles???????????????USD$325,000.00
3.Staff emolument, mobility and communication
etc????USD$57,000.00
4.Contingency  (5%)
    Grand Total ???????????????????USD$420,000.00
In the light of this, we are now on board in a
situation not to be described caused by financial
difficulty. We have no facilities neither have we any
money to purchase those materials that are absolutely
necessary in this issue.Your goodness to humanity has
ever been such as leaves not the smallest doubt you
will not suffer us to starve in the situation  you
have been pleased to place us, and which is such as
will ever tend to make us the most grateful/happy and
to ensure success as well as accomplish the set-up
goals.You  will be induced to take this issue into
consideration an urgent intervention in this
impediment, and by a little pecuniary aid, please
save us from this impasse.It will be an act worthy of
your self, and that imprint upon our heart which will
never be erased.
*OAHED will welcome any assistance you render to
enable us put in place the relevant infrastructures
that would enhance the effective and the presence of
Organization of African Health and Economic
Development in the Gambia. Any assistance given should
be considered a worthwhile service to God and Humanity
.If you require any further information or
clarification in any point, please do not hesitate to
ask.

Looking Forward to The Pleasure of your Compliance.

Yours Faithfully

Rev. Emmanuel .  E. Awuruh
CEO/PRESIDENT
ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN HEALTH AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT(OAHED)

agreement also calls for Grace to pay $71,000 in fines for
denying the agency full access to property that housed the
former mine. EPA gained full access rights to the property
in March when the U.S. District Court for the District of
Montana ordered the company to allow access to the
properties for investigation and cleanup work by the
government. . . . Page A-1

SHIPPERS WANT FEDERAL INVOLVEMENT IN ANY FUTURE RAILROAD
MORATORIUM

Railroad customers who ship hazardous materials are calling
for federal coordination if terrorist activities prompt
another moratorium on the transportation of certain
dangerous chemical shipments by rail. After the Association
of American Railroads restricted the movement of sensitive
types of cargo earlier in October, critics charge the abrupt
moratorium left shippers in the lurch and placed the
responsibility on shippers to determine the exact
restrictions on certain poison-by-inhalation chemicals,
which varied from railroad to railroad. Should a similar
moratorium be needed in the future, the National Industrial
Transportation League recommends it be handled and
coordinated by the federal government. . . . Page A-4

CHANGES URGED FOR GUIDANCE TO IMPROVE ECOLOGICAL RISK
ASSESSMENTS

Draft recommendations to help risk analysts improve
ecological risk assessments should be revised to make them
more useful, says a federal advisory board in a draft
report. EPA's Risk Assessment Forum develops the guidance,
""Planning for Ecological Risk Assessment: Developing
Management Objectives,"" to complement the ""Guidelines for
Ecological Risk Assessment"" issued by the agency in 1998.
Such guidance documents are used by companies, state
agencies, and other organizations when conducting risk
assessments. . . . Page A-3

ONTARIO ISSUES NEW RULES TO LIMIT AIR POLLUTION FROM POWER
PLANTS

New emission limits for electric utilities that burn fossil
fuels are an aggressive step in the Ontario government's
efforts to fight air pollution, says its provincial
Environment Minister Elizabeth Witmer. The phased-in limits
for Ontario's electricity generating sector will take effect
Jan. 1, and, when fully implemented in 2007, will help
Canada to meet its commitments under the Ozone Annex to the
Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement, says Witmer. She says
Ontario's new regulations include an emissions trading
system for the electricity generating sector that will
create an incentive for Ontario businesses and
municipalities to further reduce pollution. . . . Page A-5

EPA FINDS USE OF BIOREMEDIATION INCREASING AT SUPERFUND
SITES

The use of bioremediation projects to clean up superfund
sites is increasing because the technologies are less
expensive than conventional remedies. In ""Use of
Bioremediation at Superfund Sites"", EPA says, of the 1,106
superfund sites at which the agency has made a decision on
the cleanup remedy, bioremediation activities are taking
place at 78, or 7 percent of the sites. . . . Page A-2

SCIENTISTS SUGGEST EPA USE MORE COMPLEX ASSESSMENT FOR
TREATED WOOD

A scientific advisory panel recommends EPA conduct a more
complex probabilistic risk assessment for its review of wood
treated with the pesticide chromated copper arsenate, rather
than the simplified approach it chose. A panel member says
EPA could adopt a modeling approach like the one it
developed for assessing risks posed by pesticides found in
food under the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. The
recommendation by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel comes as the panel
reviews components of the agency's preliminary assessment of
hazard and exposures for children from playground equipment
treated with chromated copper arsenate. . . . Page A-8

LAKESHORE PROPERTY OWNERS FILE SUIT OVER RUNOFF FROM CHICKEN
FARMS

A group of lakeshore property owners file a lawsuit against
Tyson Foods Inc. in Oklahoma state court alleging poultry
waste from the company's operations pollute the lake to
which they have access. The plaintiffs are owners of
shorefront property at Grand Lake O' the Cherokees in
northeastern Oklahoma near the Missouri border. According to
their suit, the lake is polluted by poultry waste from a
Tyson Foods chicken-processing plant in Noel, Mo., and by
runoff from Tyson Foods chicken farms located in the
watershed of Grand Lake. . . . Page A-9

WORLD BANK REPORT TOUTS IMPORTANCE OF HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT

A healthy environment is critical to reducing worldwide
poverty, which will help to ensure development activities
are sustainable and do not deplete natural resources, says
the World Bank in its annual environmental review. The
report estimates some developing countries lose 4 percent to
6 percent of their gross domestic product because of losses
in productivity and natural capital resulting from
environmental degradation. . . . Page A-6

CALIFORNIA: The Air Resources Board approves tougher exhaust
standards for heavy-duty diesel engines that are nearly
identical to those issued early this year by EPA. The new
rules will reduce emissions of both particulate matter and
ozone-forming nitrogen oxides by 90 percent by 2010, and
emissions of non-methane hydrocarbons by 72 percent by the
same date, according to the board.  . . . Page A-5

Jim/Rob -

As Paul Kraske suggested in this e-mail today, I'm going to get Bill Lawler
from V&E involved in the India judicial probe analysis.  As you will
recall, Bill has helped us with the China problems and issues that came up
in India earlier this year (particularly charitable contributions) and more
recently with the criminal charges against Sanjeev relating to certain
quarry leases.

Let me know if you have any comments or objections to our involving Bill on
this issue.

Thanks,

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office. 
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday. 
If this is not the proper protocol, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Rob:

It's clear the Journal smells blood in the water surrounding Enron in

general and with respect to the limited partnership issues in particular.

My sense is that Enron's current media strategy is  to contain the story; a

worthy objective.  But I think the current approach of providing limited

disclosure, declining to answer questions and not making the CFO and other

executives available for interviews is compounding the perception that Enron

""doesn't get it"". There is a real issue here that is becoming a proxy for

investors and the media who complain that the company is arrogant, lacks

transparency and does not really mean it when it says it intends to be more

open.

An internal document leaked either by an investor or an Enron insider, a

series of stories all hammering essentially the same points...these are

clear signs that the story will not go away until Enron addresses the

questions more clearly and directly.  There are ways to do so in a manner

that will not undermine the company's legal position.

As I mentioned to you in the letter sent last week, I have been in this

situation with clients many times in the past, and an outsider's perspective

is of value.  Let me know if there is an opportunity to present that

perspective.

thanks

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.

All of the news today should be considered victories for the Dabhol Legal Team:  

 -- DPC's amendment to writ petition to address the biasness of MERC's commissioners was allowed.  

 -- Commissioner Deo recused himself from any further MERC hearings.  

 -- The final merits hearing on MERC jurisdiction was set for Dec. 11-14.

John,

If his schedule allows, I think Ken would be the best person to meet with the PM's secretary. If Ken is not available, I recommend either Jim or me. We do have one conflict in the schedule and that is a meeting called by all the lenders for DPC to attend that is for the week of Nov. 5. We do not know the date, and the location will be either London (our preference) or Singapore. As soon as we know this, I will let you know.

On an interesting side note, the press today reported that AES chairman Dennis Bakke wrote a letter to the Prime Minister in which he said they were increasingly frustrated with doing business in India, that all foreign investors were getting tired of this, and he said he believed that the state gov't of Orissa had EXPROPRIATED their investment. Sounds like he took a page out of Enron's book.

	The Embassy called to confirm that the Indian Prime Minister now plans to be in Washington on November 7.  We talked of a meeting on November 8 with the Secretary of the PMO.  Who would be best to take the meeting? 

	The US-India Business Council is also planning a letter to the PM which would underscore the short time left for negotiations and the need for the GOI to designate a schedule for meeting. One would think the PM would want to have made progress before arriving in Washington, but ...  John

> the Advisory Committee be composed of former officers (in the manner
> suggested by the Membership Committee report), plus a member
> designated by every company/firm stepping up to a given dues level.
> Unlike the Executive Committee, the members of the Advisory Committee
> (other than those participating in their status as former officers)
> should not be required to rotate.  A company/firm can maintain its
> same delegate to the Advisory Committee for as long as it desires.
> This would preserve some continuity and, also, not interfere with
> decisions made by those bodies maintaining financial commitments to

 W <http://graphics.nytimes.com/images/dropcap/w.gif> hat really went on in
some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen?

Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron ( news/quote
<http://www.nytimes.com/redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.m
arketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE> ) released
its quarterly earnings a week ago. Yesterday shares in Enron plunged $5.40,
to $20.65, after the company said that the Securities and Exchange
Commission was looking into the transactions.

The reaction was in some ways puzzling. Given the questions that have been
raised since the earnings announcement - some of them prominently featured
in The Wall Street Journal - it was likely that the S.E.C. would begin a
preliminary inquiry.

Whether it will go farther than that is not clear, but if nothing else the
slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confront
a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet value
to dribble out. Enron's shares rose 67 cents, to $33.84, last Tuesday, as
investors first reacted to the earnings announcement. But since then they
have fallen $13.19, or 39 percent.

The $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity was not mentioned in a
news release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday. It was
briefly mentioned in a conference call with analysts, but many of the
listeners seem to have not noticed that, wrongly thinking Kenneth L. Lay,
Enron's chairman and chief executive, was referring to a $1 billion
write-off that was disclosed in the earnings release.

When questions were asked in the following days, the explanations were less
than thorough. Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders' equity
was related to the termination of ""structured finance vehicles"" involving
partnerships that had been controlled by the company's chief financial
officer.

""Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how
the company goes about its business,"" said Ralph Pellecchia, a credit
analyst at Fitch Investors Service. He added that the issue of the company's
""credibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its
own.""

Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its
financial reports. But last night it said Mr. Lay would hold another
conference call with investors at 9:30 a.m. today.

The company's earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many
analysts. They referred to such things as ""share settled costless collar
arrangements"" and ""derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent
nature of existing restricted forward contracts."" The disclosures said the
company entered into the transactions ""to hedge certain merchant investments
and other assets.""

It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them, even though the
underlying assets included investments that declined in value. The Wall
Street Journal, citing reports the partnerships made to institutional
investors, has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash
distributions to their investors. Enron officials in recent days have
refused to discuss the arrangements in any detail.

One of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether the
termination of those transactions should have been treated as a balance
sheet item, or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected
reported earnings. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.

Under accounting rules, a company's transactions in its own shares cannot
produce profits or losses, whatever the effect on cash flow. So a company
that sells its shares for $10 each, and buys them back at $50, or at $1,
will report no earnings effect. Enron said that the reduction to
shareholders equity, and a related reduction in notes receivable, ""is the
result of Enron's termination of previously recorded contractual obligations
to deliver Enron shares in future periods.""

Stephen Moore, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who has put Enron's
debt on review for a possible downgrade, said that while some of the details
were not clear, ""Essentially, Enron's promise was that a certain amount of
Enron's shares would be worth $1 billion. The shares plummeted, and they
were not"" worth that much.

Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings, which leaves out some
expenses, and directs attention away from its balance sheet, which is
disclosed only in S.E.C. filings, not in the earnings news release. The
reduction in shareholders' equity would be shown only on the third-quarter
balance sheet, which has yet to be released.

Earlier this year, Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, reacted
strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to
provide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released. He called the
questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners. Mr. Skilling
later resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr. Lay, the
chairman and former chief executive, took back the latter title.

While Enron was riding high, its often difficult-to-understand reports were
generally seen as not being a problem. The company appeared to be the
dominant force in the business of energy trading, and to be able to produce
phenomenal profits. When Mr. Lay was reported as having played an important
role in formulating the Bush administration's energy policies, the aura was
only enhanced. In January, the shares traded for $84.

But now, with some of the company's ventures clearly having run into
problems, it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the
company's reports. That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all
was because of the involvement of the chief financial officer, and some have
wondered if there might have been similar deals with others.

Mr. Lay has promised to make the company's financial reports easier to
understand, and last week's report was at first praised by some analysts for
doing just that.

In a news release yesterday, Mr. Lay said the company welcomed the S.E.C.'s
request for information. ""We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. and look
forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest,"" he said.

Jim and Rob,
 
I hope you are both doing well. I realize that you must both be extremely busy with other more important issues but I find myself in a position that I HAVE to raise the issue described in the email below to your direct attention. The email is self explanatory but the bottom line is that not only has Enron failed to make payments that are due to me and to one of my companies for MONTHS now but  the company is not even responding to my requests for information.
 
I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to handle this, i.e WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority to make the payments and give me answers. I stress once more that the unjustified delays by Enron in making these payments is already causing me serious  problems and potential losses.
 
I look forward to your response.
 
Thanks and hope to see you soon.
 
Diomedes.

Subject: Enron payments
 
Mary Joyce,
 
I hope all is well with you. 
 
I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.
 
After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November, maybe even until late November as the ""changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November"". 
 
As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear.
 
These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday, October 24.
 
Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.
 
I look forward to hearing from you,
 
Regards,
 
 
Diomedes Christodoulou.

Paula -- we've received written questions from the New York Times for a weekend story.  I need your assistance on the following:

Why, in securities filings this year, did Enron describe its principal business as ""security brokers, dealers & flotation"" when before it had said it was in the business of ""wholesale-petroleum & petroleum products""?

Has the board taken any action in regard to the events of the past week? 

Have they called any special meetings?  formed any special committee? 

Have they hired an attorney to review the situation? 

I know you have several meetings today, but when you get a chance, would you give me a call or email me? 

Thanks, Paula!

To:	Walls Jr., Rob
Subject:	India -- Recent E-Mails re Inappropriate Activities

Rob -

I met with John Brindle on Friday to discuss the recent India e-mails.  Earlier, I talked with Bob Sparger, the HR person who is mentioned in one of the e-mails.  

I've also now reviewed a series of e-mails from ""Anonymous"", ""Enron Wellwisher"" and ""Amit Patil"".  I can't find any allegations in these e-mails that Enron has misbehaved vis-a-vis the outside world -- all of the allegations seem to me to relate to breaches of internal policies, self-dealing, etc.  Accordingly, I don't see an FCPA hook in these e-mails.  I asked John and Bob and they confirm that they do not see an FCPA issue in these e-mails.

Let me know what role you think Legal should play.  I'd be happy to have HR take the lead in following-up on what are largely HR issues.  If you want us to be more assertive in this process, we can do that as well.  In an earlier e-mail, I thought that we might be able to get Paul or Robert to help out with these e-mails.  I just don't see that this is feasible at this point -- these guys are working non-stop at firefighting at present.  We could, however, get Lena or one of the other lawyers involved.

By the way, John's people will investigate how Anonymous is getting access to our e-mail system.

Bruce

Subject:	Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation


As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"In re F&J Representation","
	Chuck and I just got off the phone with Uriel Dutton about F&J's representation.  F&J's key concern appears to be a potential ethical conflict that may arise if (a) F&J continues to represent Enron Corp., as it is currently doing with respect to IP matters and some asbestosis litigation and (b) F&J is tendered litigation or arbitration adverse to Enron Corp, even if substantially unrelated to the current matters.  Dutton confirmed that he was aware of no such litigation or arbitration having been tendered to F&J.  

	Dutton advises that while under the Texas rules of ethics, outside counsel can represent a party adverse to an existing client if the matters are not substantially related, that is not necessarily true if the matter is in federal court in Texas or brought in the courts of other states.  Further, even if a client such as Enron Corp. is willing to give an advance general ethical waiver, without knowledge of what future adverse matters F&J may take on, such ""blind waivers (my term)"" are often not upheld.  Dutton believes, however, that with respect to matter handled for former clients, it is generally the rule everywhere that there needs to be a ""substantial relationship"" between the matters for any potential ethical bar to arise.  In other words, it sounds like F&J wants to remove at least Enron Corp. from its list of current clients as soon as reasonably possible.

	Dutton did say that with respect to the other F&J matters, the bulk of which are related to Mariner, there may be some accommodation that may be reached.  Dutton will speak further with his colleagues and get back with us.  I will call Prof. Dzienkowski at the UT School of Law (our speaker for many years at the Unit CLE ethics seminar) and see if I can get some free advice about these issues.  I will of course only be speaking hypothetically.

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt

Bruce,

Herewith the bio(hagio)graphical details of Arthur Marriott QC from the
Debevoise & Plimpton website.

My experiences of Arthur Marriott QC as a presiding arbitrator are good. He
is not a lawyer of the same calibre as Lord Mustill or Andrew Rogers QC (nor
would he,I think,claim to be).  But he is very practical and knows what he
is doing.  He wants to get on with things where he can. He is also quite
adroit at managing tribunals. That is almost certainly going to prove to be
a necessary skill with Kamal Hossain who will see his role as advocating the
GOI's position and engineering whatever delay the GOI wants. I am hopeful
that (eventually) Kamal Hossain will overplay his hand,which will leave
us,in practical terms,with a Rogers-Marriott tribunal.

INTERIOR'S REVISIONS OF HARDROCK MINING REGULATIONS
CHALLENGED IN COURT

Environmental groups amend a lawsuit in federal district
court to overturn recent revisions the Department of
Interior made to rules regulating mining on public lands.
Claiming the revisions further weaken the environmental
mining rules, the Mineral Policy Center, Great Basin Mine
Watch, and Guardians of Our Rural Environment challenge
Interior Secretary Norton's decisions on the grounds they
violate the Federal Land Policy and Management Act's mandate
""to prevent undue degradation"" of public lands. The groups
also asked the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia to prevent the Norton mining rules from taking
effect while the court considers the case. . . . Page A-1

EPA TO PROPOSE EMISSIONS LIMITS FOR ASPHALT PROCESSING
OPERATIONS

EPA is proposing air toxics emissions standards for asphalt
processing and asphalt roofing manufacturers. The proposed
rule would apply to facilities that produce ""blown"" asphalt
for use in making roof shingles. The proposal also would
apply to plants that apply blown asphalt to fiberglass or
apply felt to produce shingles. The proposed rule is ready
for publication in the ""Federal Register"", but its
publication date is not set. . . . Page A-2

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y6f4d4_


NEW YORK ENACTS NEW RULES FOR PROPOSED ELECTRIC GENERATING
FACILITIES

Gov. Pataki signs legislation to expand the environmental
requirements power companies must meet before they can
participate in New York's expedited approval process for new
or modified electric generating facilities. Under the new
law, power companies must demonstrate their proposed
facility would be equipped with technologies that avoid or
minimize the number of aquatic organisms that are impinged
on filtering screens or entrained in intake systems used to
draw water to cool electric generation equipment. . . . Page
A-9

NEW DATA REVIEWED AS EPA CONSIDERS CHANGES TO ANIMAL FEEDLOT
PROPOSAL

More flexible approaches to regulating water pollution from
livestock operations are being considered by EPA as the
result of new data received on a proposed rule to curb
discharges from these facilities. A ""notice of data
availability"" contains information the agency is considering
to refine its cost and economics model used in the proposed
rule that would set effluent limitation guidelines for
concentrated animal feeding operations. . . . Page A-4

CALIFORNIA CONCENTRATES ON HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM RULE FOR
DRINKING WATER

California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard
Assessment pulls the plug on its suggested ""public health
goal"" for total chromium in drinking water because it was
based on potentially flawed science. Allan Hirsch, a
spokesman for the agency, says rather than set a new goal
for total chromium, the state will focus on establishing a
goal for hexavalent chromium, also called chromium 6. The
California Department of Health Services is required to
adopt a chromium 6 standard by January 2004. . . . Page A-11

IRRIGATION DISTRICT TO PAY FOR HABITAT PROJECTS TO SETTLE
PESTICIDE LITIGATION

An Oregon irrigation district agrees to pay $100,000 for
habitat protection projects to resolve Clean Water Act
litigation concerning aquatic herbicide applications under a
proposed consent decree filed in  the U.S. District Court
for the District of Oregon. The case stems from the Talent
Irrigation District's application of an aquatic herbicide to
an irrigation canal. . . . Page A-4

COURT PERMITS PRIVATE GROUPS TO APPEAL DECISION AFFECTING
COHO SALMON

A federal judge tells a consortium of environmental groups
they may intervene to appeal a district court ruling
affecting the listing of salmon as an endangered species.
After the National Marine Fisheries Service announced it
would not appeal the district court's decision that the
agency had erred when listing only wild and not
hatchery-reared Oregon Coastal coho salmon under the
Endangered Species Act, Earthjustice and other environmental
and fishing requested to intervene for the purposes of
appeal. . . . Page A-6

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y6b3p8_


AIR DISTRICT APPROVES PLAN TO CUT DUST IN CALIFORNIA'S MAIN
FARMING AREA

The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District
approves a measure to reduce dust from unpaved roads,
parking lots, and storage areas. The rule is developed to
address the air pollution problems in the 25,000-square-mile
Central Valley, the state's main agricultural area, and to
prevent EPA from blocking more than $2 billion in federal
transportation funds. . . . Page A-10

HIGHWAY AGENCY, ARMY CORPS ADDRESS WETLANDS ISSUES, ROAD
PROJECTS

Officials from the Federal Highway Administration and the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are working to address issues
that can impede efficient wetlands permitting processes for
transportation projects, officials tell an interagency
meeting. As a result of a workshop on environmental
streamlining, FHWA and corps officials are discussing a
range of options for streamlining the Clean Water Act
Section 404 permitting process for transportation projects
that affect wetlands. . . . Page A-6

DOE'S INSPECTOR GENERAL CITES LAW FIRM FOR POTENTIAL
CONFLICT OF INTEREST

A law firm contracted by the Energy Department to work on
the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository may have
violated the conflict-of-interest terms of its contract by
continuing to lobby on behalf of the Nuclear Energy
Institute, according to a report from the DOE Office of
Inspector General. Nevada's two senators, both of whom
strongly oppose the Yucca Mountain project, blast the law
firm of Winston & Strawn for ""misconduct"" and vowed to
pursue ""every possible legal remedy."" . . . Page A-8

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
___________________

TRANSPORT: Legislation intended to protect the public
against the threat of chemical attacks has aroused the
opposition of hazardous materials transporters who say it
could hamper the Department of Transportation's authority to
regulate hazardous materials. The Chemical Security Act (S.
1602) would allow EPA to issue administrative orders and to
secure relief through litigation when there is an ""imminent
and substantial endangerment from a potential accident or
criminal release."" The proposal has the potential to
threaten Transportation's authority to regulate hazmat, says
the National Association of Chemical Distributors. . . .
Page A-3

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y6e0k3_

HAZARDOUS WASTE: Three wastes generated mainly from
inorganic chemical manufacturing processes are now listed as
hazardous waste in a final EPA rule to be published today.
The three wastes--K176, K177, and K178--will now be
regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act's
hazardous waste management rules. . . . Page A-2

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y6g8t9_

RESEARCH: EPA awards more than $22 million in grants to
universities to establish five hazardous substance research
centers. The centers will research potential effects of
hazardous substances in the environment and will provide
community outreach, according to EPA Administrator Whitman.

"NEW METALS TRANSACTIONS","
Jim,

we are evaluating 3 metals assets acquisition opportunities: 

1. the Longview alumina smelter in Washington State

2. the Vanalco alumina smelter in Washington State

3. an Arco/BP aluminum rolling facility in Kentucky.

I would like to run with one external US firm on these deals (the 3 deals are at exactly the same preliminary stage and there will be some economies of scale to be had. Also consistency of approach is important). The firm also needs to have strong offices with metals expertise both in London and New York and preferably close to the facilities in question. 

The firm I believe can deliver these advantages is Shearman and Sterling. I have spoken to a couple of people in the Houston office about this to get their views.

I would be grateful for your confirmation that you have no objection to this.

Thanks very much Jim.

CONGRESS APPROVES SUPERFUND BILL TO PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT OF
BROWNFIELDS

The Senate approves a superfund reform bill that would
provide liability relief to small businesses and innocent
landowners, after a Wyoming senator withdraws his opposition
to the bill (H.R. 2869). The House had passed the measure
earlier in the day, which means the first major piece of
environmental legislation to clear Congress in 2001, a
measure designed to promote redevelopment of polluted
properties known as brownfields, is now ready for President
Bush's signature. The legislation also seeks to promote
redevelopment of brownfields sites by authorizing $250
million annually to fund assessment and cleanup activities.

REPORT FROM WHITE HOUSE EXPECTED ON FUEL ECONOMY CREDIT
TRADING

A Bush administration task force is looking to expand on a
recent National Academy of Sciences proposal to establish a
system of tradeable credits under the Corporate Average Fuel
Economy program, John Graham, chief regulatory official at
the White House, tells BNA. ""Such a program would be less
costly than the current program and create a continuous
incentive for automakers to improve fuel economy,"" says
Graham. Under such a scenario, automakers could get credits
for achieving greater fuel economy standards than required
under the CAFE program and sell those credits to other
companies struggling to meet the standards. . . . Page A-1

WHITMAN SIGNS RULE TO MAKE HAZARDOUS WASTE CLEANUPS EASIER,
CHEAPER

EPA Administrator Whitman signs a final rule that will allow
companies to consolidate hazardous waste at remediation
sites without triggering the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act's strict waste management regulations. The
final Corrective Action Management Unit rule is expected to
make contaminated site cleanups easier and cheaper for
companies by allowing consolidation of waste for temporary
or permanent disposal. . . . Page A-6

EPA PETITIONED TO HALT USE OF TWO PESTICIDES USED TO TREAT
WOOD

Several environmental and public health groups petition EPA
to halt immediately the use of two pesticides used to treat
wood and are threatening to sue the agency if it fails to
suspend their use. The federal government has failed to act
to protect children from exposure to the wood preservatives
chromated copper arsenate and pentachlorophenol, according
to a statement from Beyond Pesticides/National Coalition
Against the Misuse of Pesticides, a Washington-based
organization, and the lead petitioner. . . . Page A-1

SENATE'S ANTI-TERRORISM BILL AUTHORIZES FUNDS FOR DRINKING
WATER SECURITY

The Senate passes an anti-terrorism bill that would
authorize a $50 million EPA program for drinking water and
wastewater security grants over six years. A similar bill
passed by the House authorizes $60 million for those
activities over the next five years. . . . Page A-2

COURT SAYS MASSACHUSETTS SUPERFUND LAW DOES NOT PRECLUDE
JURY TRIAL

A Massachusetts trial court finds the state's hazardous
waste law, which is modeled on the federal superfund
statute, does not preclude jury trials. In doing so, the
court declines to follow federal case law barring jury
trials in superfund cost recovery suits. . . . Page A-3

REGIONAL WATER BOARD DELAYS TOUGHER STANDARDS FOR ORANGE
COUNTY, CALIF.

The Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board decides
to postpone for one month action on a municipal stormwater
permit that proposes tougher standards for cities in Orange
County, Calif. Officials from many of the 24 cities in the
county asked for the delay to enable them to review
revisions in the five-year national pollutant discharge and
elimination system permit. . . . Page A-4

EPA FINDS 'DEFICIENCY' IN AIR PERMITTING PROGRAM OF
WASHINGTON, D.C.

The air permitting program in the District of Columbia does
not provide adequate public notice of permitting decisions
and does not comply with federal regulations under Title V
of the Clean Air Act, according to EPA. A ""notice of
deficiency,"" published by EPA in the ""Federal Register"", is
a prerequisite for withdrawal of EPA approval for the
District's operating permit programs, but the director of
the air protection division in EPA Region III says D.C. is
not in danger of losing control of its air operating permit
program. . . . Page A-2

Rosie:

I have about 70 interviews on the Ken Lay and Enron story transcribed and in various states of revision, and of course the future of the project is now up in the air.

What I have on paper naturally tells a positive story about Ken individually and Enron.   I am concerned that all this will be lost given what has gone on in recent weeks and months and what will continue to go on in 2002 with legal matters.  One pitch I have is that I could finish the interviews and revisions focusing on the many positives before the merger to ensure that this record exists for posterity.

Could you prioritize a meeting with Ken to discuss what I have and where we could go with it in the future either internally or externally?  A lot of ideas are running through my head.  Cindy Olson is also involved with this, and I need to talk to Jim Derrick some  for the legal angle.  One or both of them could join us at the meeting if Ken would like--along with anyone else Ken would like to be there.

If this meeting is in December that will be fine, but I might have a visitor badge by then for all I know.

- Rob

P.S. I'm fine--hope you are too!

"Dahbol -- Adding Greg Reid of Linklaters to the Dabhol Team","Jim/Rob -

Given the number of litigation issues, the Linklaters Dabhol team needs another senior lawyer to help lead various efforts (which I have advocated).  Christopher Walker has recommended that Greg Reid of Linklaters join the team.  I believe that Greg is currently head of Linklaters International Arbitration group.

I've spoken with Barry Hunsaker and Stephen Wallace regarding Greg.  Both had very favorable things to say about Greg:  Hard-working, detail-oriented, smart, etc.  Neither of them had any reservations about Greg although he apparently does have a sharp sense of humor (so I can see why he and Chris get along).

Greg would not handle the ""India side"" of the litigation efforts which would remain with Chris.  He would help with the ""London side"" and the lender enforcement side (to the extent that occurs outside India).  In any event, Chris would remain as the leader of the overall litigation effort and we will expect Chris to keep tabs on matters Greg is handling to ensure the overall coordination of the effort.

Let me know if you have any comments or objections to Greg's involvement.

Subject:	Dahbol


Dear Mr Lundstrom,

from discussions with my partner, Sandeep Katwala, I understand that as the
number of issues and proceedings arising out of the Dahbol project continue
to proliferate we need to increase the partner resources devoted to the
matter.

I attach a short cv giving my professional and academic background. I have
been at Linklaters for 16 years doing litigation and arbitration . For the
last 2 years I have been co-ordinating L&A's European arbitration practice,
but have, in the past, worked closely with Chris Walker. I have also had
considerable exposure to power projects, both domestic and international
(including an involvement in the Appeal to the Supreme Court in Pakistan on
the Hub project).

Last year I successfully completed a significant arbitration for EOG. Please
feel free to call Barry Hunsaker at EOG if you would like more background on
that job. I am presently acting on a much smaller matter for Enron (taking
instructions from Stephen Wallace) that comes to hearing in London on 8/9
November.

I am presently based in Paris, but spend about one third of my time in our
London office. This is increasing and, as a result, I will be moving back to
London in July/August of next year. If you have any questions regarding my
suitability to join the team on the Dahbol project please do not hesitate to
call me direct.

yours sincerely

Coralina, you'll recall that all of the above companies were set up to be part of the Power Plant/Regasification facility JV with Union Fenosa.  That has died, and these companies are now considered ""shelf"" companies, with no business and no purpose; however, we cannot keep them as such, since they are costly, I'd like to dissolve them before year-end.

Would you kindly send me a return message with your approval to proceed with dissolving all of the above entities.  I of course will send an annoucement memo company-wide (""Notice of Intent to Dissolve"") to give those involved a chance to review and respond back if there is any reason NOT to dissolve them.  I do have one group wanting Enron Dominicana B.V.

Thanks Cora.

Subject:  Judicial Probe

Wade-

Suhas called to let me know that former justice of the supreme court J
Kurdukar has been appointed as the presiding judge of the GOM commission of
inquiry.  We anticipate a formal notification by the GOM of the probe and
its terms of reference some time later today.  From what I understand he is
considered more objective than some of the other proposed candidates and,
to that extent, he may be less likely to mount a crusade against the
company and its officers and directors.  At the same time, he is renowned
for the glacial pace of the proceedings over which he presides.  Evidently,
he tends to allow every interested party opportunities to intervene and be
heard and the Narmada Dam resettlement which he evidently has also
overseen, has dragged on for most of the last ten years. We'll try to find
out a little more about what he's done recently and let you know what the
bio looks like.

Obviously another logistical question of interest is how long it will
actually take the commission to get up and running.  Suhas seemed to think
it would take a couple of weeks for Kurdukar to organize financing from the
GOM (good luck) and get a small staff together.  Needless to say, if there
are other actions which we contemplate taking prior to the commission being
convened, we probably should not wait.

2. Dressing rooms
3. Storage for instruments and other  items
4. Symphony offices
5. SPA offices
6. Rehearsal hall
 
I wrote to you two weeks ago asking your thoughts  about using Jones Hall funds to assist with the renovation of the rehearsal  hall, primarily to protect Mario et al from going back to City Council for  more money. However, the accumulated projects listed above have turned out to  be so costly that there was no way to eke out the dollars here and there. As a  result, Mario and Jordy Tollett are now leading a new request to fund the  projects listed above. This request COULD (but will not necessarily) be  presented to Council next Tuesday, November 23 by Jordy. 
 
The total cost of these projects is $2.9 million,  of which approximately $1 million is attributable to the relocation of the  music library and the ""dominoes"" that follow that relocation - i.e., the  relocation of the storage rooms and the dressing rooms.
 
I will let you know what happens at City Council.  Mario has been good about keeping me informed but has not asked for any help  from the Foundation.
 
In other areas, Chip has settled back into the  Hall and we are acquiring office furniture for his humble space. I will be  contacting each of you to schedule a meeting in early December, and at that  time will issue a 2002 quarterly board meeting calendar that we will try to  cast in stone for next year.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions. I  am relieved that it appears that the Foundation will not need to part with  more money to help with this renovation at the present time, although we might  still be called upon to do so. I will keep you informed.
 
Have a wonderful weekend and, if I don't speak  with you next week, a lovely Thanksgiving.
 
Best,
 
Kim Sterling

John,
Here?s the CV of the lawyer that we referred to previously (it is
unfortunately in Spanish). Her field of specialization is Administrative
law. She currently works for the Municipality of La Plata, though she
may get a leave to do this job for us. I am concerned about this point.
If this is an obstacle that we could not overcome (I
 know you have asked the opinion of Jim Derrick about her), we may have
to look for another alternative as soon as possible.

"Nov. 2 Meeting Cancellation Notice","Jim,

We need to advise the Executive Committee members that the November 2
meeting is canceled so they can free next Friday up on their calendars.

Shall I send the memo below (after you've added the dates you propose
and made any other modifications you wish), or would you rather I
contact them myself and simply tell them to stand by for more
information?

Thanks.

TO: The Executive Committee of the Institute for Law and Technology

FROM: James V. Derrick, Jr., Chair

RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have determined
to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date. I
hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have already
made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
<mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of your
availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

a) ____________

b) ____________

c) ____________

d) ____________

After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting for
the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members and
notify you of the new date.

Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that we
have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.

Hi Jim,

Well, it's been quite a month!  I hope the dust is clearing for you a
little bit, at least.

The results of our email poll of Executive Committee members for our
inaugural meeting are as follows:

a)  Friday, January 11, 2002 -- all can make it except McNamara, Kryder
and (maybe) Green;

b)  Friday, January 18, 2002 -- all can make it except Kryder and
(maybe) Green;

c)  Wednesday, January 23, 2002 -- all can make it except (maybe) Green.

Shall we go ahead and nail down the meeting date and circulate it so the
folks can lock it in on their calendars?  What day do you choose?

Thank you so much for finding the time to manage this matter, as you
have, amid all the other matters on your plate.

David

Subject:	Erroneous press

Mark, I'm sure you are aware of the comments in the press that I have copied and inserted here below.  There have been others that are similar.  Basically, the press is reporting that we have dissolved the LJM partnerships, ended all relationships with the LJM entities, etc.  All that we have done is unwind the raptor entities, LJM still exists, all other transactions with LJM still exist, it's just that Andy sold his interest in the partnerships.  Michael Kopper owns them and would probably be considered a ""friend of Enron"" by investors/journalists.

I'm concerned about our efforts to build back investor confidence - do we correct the press?  how do we address this?  I'm concerned that we will once again be hit with credibility concerns when the press or investors fully understand that LJM still exists and we have deals still pending with it and have deals still in place with it.  How do we correct this erroneous press?   Sherron Watkins

"Deena Hays v. Enron North America Corp. d/b/a Enron Energy Services, No. 1999-64225, In the 129th Judicial District Court, Harris County, Texas","	Jim,

	I wanted to give you advance notice that the referenced matter could go to trial sometime during the week of October 22, 2001. This is a wrongful termination suit (sex discrimination/hostile work environment) which was filed on December 30, 1999.  Plaintiff seeks back pay, front pay and compensatory damages.  The case does not present substantial exposure to the company as Plaintiff's backpay claim is less than $20,000 and I believe that the likelihood of her recovery of frontpay or compensatory damages is remote, because she quit a job with Halliburton just a few months ago and because there simply is no evidence that she suffered compensatory damages since her discharge from EES. 

	The case is pending before Judge Patrick Mizell. Before he proceeds with the trial, the court will have to rule on the pending motions for summary judgment, which we have filed on behalf of EES and which could very well dispose of this case. Plaintiff has not timely responded to the motions. Last week, the court allowed Plaintiff's counsel to withdraw from the case, but the court assured me that he would not postpone the trial or the hearing on the pending motions. Plaintiff has indicated that she intends to hire replacement counsel, but to date no appearance has been made on her behalf.  I anticipate that she will be appearing pro se before the court.  The hearing on the motion is set for October 22, 2001 and I think there is a good chance that the MSJ will be granted. 

	Despite several attempts over the last three months to explore pretrial resolution of this matter, Plaintiff has refused to make a settlement demand or even meet with an EES human resource representative to discuss settlement. Her unwillingness to even discuss settlement is part of the reason that her former attorneys withdrew from the case. I fully expect that we will be required to take this matter through trial if the court does not rule in our favor on the pending motions. We have made the appropriate arrangements with witnesses so that if necessary, we will be ready to go next week. We are listed third or fourth on the trailing trial docket.

	I will keep you advised of any further developments. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Dabhol and the do nothing Government

By Prem Shankar Jha

Ever since the Vajpayee's Government came to power more than two
and a half years ago, the economy has been sliding relentlessly
into the deepest recession it has ever known. In the nine months
since December industrial growth has averaged 1.7 per cent. The
decade when it averaged 9 per cent and the months, only five
years ago, when it touched 16.2 per cent, are now but a distant
memory. Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September 11
terrorist strikes in the U.S. It has now shrunk dramatically -
vehicle sales dropped by 20 percent in September and colour TV
sets registered a growth of a measly 3 to 4 per cent. With no
demand to power it, inflation, measured by the consumer price
index, has fallen almost to zero. The share market is dead and
there is no fresh investment. Employment in the organised sector
is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human
memory.

In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to
find a place, however humble, in the organised sector of the
economy but been turned away. By 2004, the number will have risen
by another three million. But Mr. Yashwant Sinha is confident
that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of
the country's problems.

But one recent event highlights the government's paralysis more
sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do. This is its
failure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of the
Maharashtra State Electricity Boards's attempt to foil Enron's
bid to take it before an international arbitration court by
claiming that a case was pending before an Indian court
challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase
agreement.

The London Court correctly maintained that just as a government's
international obligations as defined by the Treaty or the
agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law,
proceedings in an international court must take precedence over
those in a domestic court. The way has, therefore, been cleared
for India to face the humiliation of being dragged before an
international tribunal for a breach of it contractual
obligations.

Given the fearsome proficiency of Enron's lawyers, both those
whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase
agreement, it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEB
will lose the case. If that happens, then by a conservative
estimate, India will have to pay around $5 billion, in costs and
damages. In addition it will have to spend a little more to
complete phase II of the project. Thus in the end the project is
likely to cost not $3 billion but more like $5.2 to 5.4 billion.
For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has
dragged on, the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this was
simply a dispute between a State Government and a private
company, and it had no say in the matter. That pretext in any
case wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter-
guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues. But
today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because
neither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable,
let alone willing, to pay such an enormous penalty. So the bill
will, inevitably land at the Centre's door. And that means the
taxpayer's door.

The Centre will have no option but to pay. But having done so,
will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government? The
answer, obviously, is no. What it will be forced to do is
transfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to complete
and operate. But since no one can possibly run a $5 billion power
plant generating 2,100 MW of power profitably, the NTPC too will
insist on the capital value of the project being substantially
written down first. Judging from the offers that the Tata
Electric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply
Company (BSES) were making to Enron, the written down value will
not exceed $2 billion. Thus, whichever way we look at it, the
country will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant ($3
billion) without getting a single watt of electricity or for that
matter anything else) in return.

None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enron
probably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Rao
government agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis. Nor is
it intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government that
had it only brought the Maharashtra government and more
particularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginning
the latter's inability under law to pay backup charges at more
than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants
would have been exposed long ago.

But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify
even greater mistakes in the future. For better or for worse, the
Enron deal was struck, and it was struck not once but twice. As a
serious, responsible government that knows the importance of
honouring one's word in a world where contract is king, the
Vajpayee Government must honour the country's contractual
obligations. This does not in any way preclude its trying to
alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not
see, but by definition all future changes must be by mutual
consent.

The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhol's power
affordable, are known to all. As the 1995 Renegotiating Committee
and the Godbole Committee recommended, the Government should buy
the $800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into a
separate company that can supply gas to all the current and
future users on the west coast. In fact, it could go one better
and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage
the plant. This is entirely feasible because its installed
capacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need. This
will bring down the capital cost, upon which backup charges and
cost per unit of power will be calculated, to $2.2 billion.

Second, the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of the
equity in Dabhol from the promoters. This was negotiated with the
1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so.
This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign
exchange to $1.9 billion and the debt portion whose servicing
represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to $1.2 billion.

The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman
of BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee
debt. That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity
tariffs to changes in the exchange rate. With the price of oil
having fallen (for India) to around $20 a barrel, these changes
will bring down the cost of Dabhol's power at 90 per cent
capacity utilisation own to below Rs. 2.40 a unit. This will make
it entirely viable, especially if Maharashtra and the
neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the
average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and
reduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector.

The right course for the centre even at this late stage will be
to take over the project from the MSEB, renegotiate it with
Enron, or if Enron wants to opt out, then buy the project from it
at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before
handing it over to the NTPC. Getting dragged to court will
neither solve the problem of paying for Dabhol's power nor answer
the more basic question - how can any electricity grid add new
power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it
charges for electricity.

Dear All,

With reference to Art 14.2 (11) of the Articles of Association the Management Board wishes to ask the Supervisory Board for written consent to assign the rights of ownership of motor vehicle Alfa Romeo (reg - RLE 400) to the insurers PZU to enable them to pay compensation to ENS for the theft of the vehicle. Should the vehicle now be found, the property rights to the vehicle will reside with PZU.

      RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

      Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have
   determined
      to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later
date.
   I
      hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have
   already
      made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

      Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to
find a
      date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
      <mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of
   your
      availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as
we
      originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00
p.m.
      followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

      a) ____________

      b) ____________

      c) ____________

      d) ____________

      After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our
meeting
   for
      the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee
members
   and
      notify you of the new date.

      Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important
that
   we
      have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year,
and
      I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.

Jim/Rob -

As Paul Kraske suggested in this e-mail today, I'm going to get Bill Lawler
from V&E involved in the India judicial probe analysis.  As you will
recall, Bill has helped us with the China problems and issues that came up
in India earlier this year (particularly charitable contributions) and more
recently with the criminal charges against Sanjeev relating to certain
quarry leases.

Let me know if you have any comments or objections to our involving Bill on
this issue.

Thanks,
Bruce

    Senior Vice President of the Council on Foreign Relations, will chair.

    Based in Chicago, David Hale advises the Zurich Financial Services'

"RE: registered agent for PGE","Excellent. 

Is David also to be the registered agent for the other 5 states in which PGE appears from the data sheets to be licensed to do business? What about PGE subsidiaries? What about Alberta -- I would anticipate that the current Canadian agent would be maintained and that he would interface on SOP directly with David?

I would ask that you provide Becky with a list of the companies by states for which David will serve as registered agent. Also, if David's team is entering the critical case information on LawManager as SOP is received, which I understand they are or plan to do, then we need not ask David to forward a copy of the SOP transmittal sheet to Becky; otherwise, she will need a copy. Of course, should any PGE-related service be received through Becky, she will advise David of same by email and follow-up with hard copies.

Thanks for your assistance.

regarding distribution to Enron of documents served on PGE's registered agent?

We're assuming the change will take effect on June 1.

Rosy's been off for the past few days, so I haven't been able to get an update

Anything PGE needs to do to make this go smoothly?

MONITORING RECOMMENDED IN EPA GUIDANCE ON WATER POLLUTION
REPORTS

Recommendations to states for doing biological monitoring to
determine whether a water body is impaired and requires a
total maximum daily load of pollutants is contained in final
guidance released by EPA. The ""2002 Integrated Water Quality
Monitoring and Assessment Report Guidance"" calls on states
to develop a comprehensive monitoring and assessment
strategy describing their approach to obtaining data used to
characterize the attainment status of their waters. The
final guidance, developed by EPA's Office of Wetlands,
Oceans and Watersheds in the agency's Office of Water does
not differ substantially from draft guidance circulated last
month. . . . Page A-1,  Text E-1

STAFF SAYS TECHNOLOGY TO MEET NONROAD DIESEL RULES
AVAILABLE, FEASIBLE

Current technology makes it feasible for heavy-duty diesel
engine manufacturers to meet the most stringent emission
standards in place for engines that are more or less than 50
horsepower, according to EPA staff. This finding, announced
in a technical staff paper open for public comment, sets the
agency up to enter the next phase of nonroad diesel engine
regulation--more stringent standards for these engines and
their diesel fuel, says an EPA official in the Office of
Transportation and Air Quality. . . . Page A-8

NATURAL GAS, PIPELINE INDUSTRIES SEEK LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE
SAFETY

Leading natural gas and liquid pipeline industry groups urge
the Bush administration to press Congress to pass
legislation to improve pipeline safety. In a letter to
Transportation Secretary Mineta, industry officials say a
working group of leaders from liquid pipeline, natural gas
transmission, and natural gas distribution companies ""has
reached consensus on numerous issues that promote the
continued safety and reliability of the nation's pipelines.""

U.N. REPORT TARGETS SEWAGE TREATMENT AS TOP PRIORITY TO
PROTECT OCEANS

A United Nations Environment Program report cites poorly
planned coastal development, sewage flows, and excessive
nutrients from industrial and agricultural runoff as the
most serious problems associated with ocean pollution. The
report was prepared for a meeting next week in Montreal of
the organization's Global Program of Action for the
Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-Based
Activities. . . . Page A-3

PESTICIDE MAKERS GET MORE TIME FOR AIR POLLUTION
PRECOMPLIANCE PLANS

Pesticide active ingredient makers will get three more
months to submit precompliance plans for hazardous air
pollutant emissions limits under a final rule being
published today by EPA. A separate final rule also being
published today changes the definition of ""process tank"" for
pesticide makers as part of the settlement of a lawsuit
filed by an industry group. . . . Page A-2

EPA PROPOSES TO ALLOW CERTAIN HAZARDOUS WASTES TO BE SENT TO
LANDFILLS

EPA proposes a rule that would allow, under limited
conditions, hazardous waste eligible for placement in
Corrective Action Management Unit sites to be disposed of in
federally regulated hazardous waste landfills. Several
industry groups had pushed to have the proposed change
included in an EPA rule proposed last year that addressed
Corrective Action Management Unit sites and had sought to
make it easier for industries to clean up hazardous waste
sites. EPA issues this separate, new proposed rule
addressing off-site shipment of some wastes as a result of
those comments on last year's proposal. . . . Page A-4

REVISIONS TO VERMONT WETLANDS RULES RELAX REQUIREMENTS FOR
DEVELOPERS

Revised wetland rules that would loosen some regulatory
requirements on developers are expected to be adopted in
Vermont next month. The rules would streamline the wetlands
review process in Vermont and ease regulatory burdens for
routine development activities. But the rules also would
provide added protection for Class I wetlands, already the
most protected category of wetlands. . . . Page A-5

EPA DRAFT POLICY EVALUATES PESTICIDE EXPOSURE THROUGH
DRINKING WATER

EPA plans to release today for public comment a draft policy
to explain how it will implement the Food Quality Protection
Act of 1996 requirement to evaluate exposures to pesticides
through drinking water. Under the policy, absent evidence to
the contrary, the agency says it will not generally conclude
that drinking water treatment would reduce exposures to a
pesticide. . . . Page A-6

INTERNATIONAL TRADE

WTO: The European Union assures the United States it will
not promote the use of the ""precautionary principle"" to
justify the imposition of illegitimate trade barriers in
negotiations expected next year to clarify the relationship
between World Trade Organization rules and multilateral
environmental agreements, such as the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species and the Cartagena
Protocol of Biosafety. U.S. officials say the commitment was
made in a letter from the EU Trade Commissioner during the
recent meeting of trade ministers in Doha, Qatar. The
ministers agreed in Doha to launch a new round of
multilateral trade talks that will include discussions on
the relationship between WTO rules and ""specific trade
obligations"" set out in multilateral environmental

Subject: Another 401(k) story - tomorrow

Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=""=_C994FA67.1F7E4D46""


Jeff Manning at The Oregonian called to say tomorrow's newspaper will have  another report on the Enron 401(k) problems, and the connection to PGE through  the details of three lawsuits. I said nothing new, but did clarify a quote that  had appeared from PGE in the previous story Manning wrote.
 
I've copied Doug on this because the issue is getting more serious.  Manning informed me that The Oregonian has now assigned him and Gail Hill  to ""charge ahead and do more on this story."" They want to sit down with HR and  review documentation that proves that we have provided financial planning  counsel, that we have provided information about diversifying portfolios, etc.  This is strongly leaning in the legal area, and we would like to have  counsel before saying anything further. We can't expect much cover from Enron,  either: Manning vented to me about how no one there will return his calls.
 
Carol, Gail, Kregg and I can be available to meet early tomorrow to discuss  how to move ahead on this. Doug, let us know if sometime before noon might work  for you. Thanks.

Mike -

While one paragraph states that normal destruction policies are suspended it states in the next paragraph to retain only ones related LJM.  My interpretation is ""preserve anything to do with LJM and if you are unsure preserve anything you think is related to LJM until you can verify"". 

Jim - This is an inquiry from our New York trading office.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers
are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM
partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests
in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to
preserve documents that might be used in the litigation.

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended
immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings,
e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way
relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2,
including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any
transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and
Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a
requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil
and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the
meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with
anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

POWER BRIEFS
FRIDAY, JUNE 1, 2001



* * * DELIVERING ON THE STRATEGY  - On Tuesday, May 30th, NewPower celebrated a record-breaking day in customer sign ups. Between the Charlotte and Herndon facilities, and the company's outbound telemarketing efforts, NewPower booked more than 1,300 accounts for the day!  Approximately 572 new customers called in to our center to come onboard for a gas plan, while approximately 390 called in for electric.  Total (gas and electric) residential outbound telemarketing efforts for the day brought in approximately 287 new customers, while outbound telemarketers enrolled approximately 63 new small commercial customers.  Since August, NewPower has enrolled roughly 120,000 gas and electric customers.  The count for the end of June is estimated at 124,000 (this does not take into account Tuesday's remarkable results).  This is the beginning of great things to come for NewPower's marketing and customer contact efforts.   Please share the great news with contractors and consultants.

MASSACHUSETTS ELECTRIC FIRMS ASK REGULATORS TO RAISE RATES - [Boston Globe, May 26.]  Two big utilities that serve electric customers in Central Massachusetts yesterday filed for fuel charge increases for residential customers. The rate increases being sought by Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Co. and Massachusetts Electric Co. apply to ""standard offer"" service and follow the filing a week ago by NSTAR Electric for fuel charge increases in its standard offer and default service generation rates. Massachusetts Electric, a retail arm of National Grid USA in Westboro, also filed yesterday seeking to increase its standard offer by the same amount -- 1.23 cents -- from 5.401 per kWh to 6.631 cents per kWh.  The rate increase would add $6.15 to the monthly bill of typical residential customer using 500 kilowatts, pushing it from $56.54 to $62.69. http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=CoW8Qqaicr0WTruXfq1rssum&FQ=%22fitchburg%20gas%22&Nav=na-search-&StoryTitle=%22fitchburg%20gas%22 

ELECTRICITY-CHOICE PROMOTION PROGRAM STUDY IN MISCUES - [Columbus Dispatch, May 27.]  If you listen to the people who run Ohio Electric Choice -- the state's electricity-deregulation program -- the marketing plan has been a success. According to one survey, 62 percent of Ohioans are aware of the plan to allow them to choose their electricity provider. That compares with 38 percent who knew of the plan before a multimillion-dollar public-relations and advertising campaign began last year.  But in real terms, the $11.2 million being spent statewide during the first 12 months of the five-year plan doesn't seem to have produced many tangible results. So far, only 150,000 residential customers in northern Ohio and 500 more in the central and southern parts of the state have switched suppliers.  There's been more success with community-driven efforts -- and with little noticeable assistance from the statewide promotional dollars. http://libpub.dispatch.com/cgi-bin/documentv1?DBLIST=cd01&DOCNUM=23614&TERMV=31224:6:31289:6:51808:6:

BIZ SCHOOL GRADS REDISCOVER ENERGY - [Reuters, May 27.] Getting a job in the staid energy business hasn't exactly been considered the pinnacle of success for ambitious business school graduates.

AGL TO SHUT OFF 4,000 MORE CUSTOMERS - [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 29.] Nearly a quarter of a million Georgia households are on Atlanta Gas Light Co.'s turnoff list, almost two months after expiration of a Public Service Commission-ordered moratorium on disconnections of natural gas service.  That's 16 percent of the 1.5 million homes and businesses in the state that purchase natural gas from unregulated marketers and are supplied through AGL's pipeline system. Most of the accounts on the disconnection list will never be actually turned off because customers will pay their bills or make payment arrangement with marketers. http://www.accessatlanta.com/partners/ajc/newsatlanta/0529gas.html

Proposed by state Rep. William G. Greene, D-Billerica, it comes as skyrocketing electricity prices force California and other states to consider the change, too. http://www.telegram.com/news/page_one/savetime1.html 

TAPPING POWER OF SUPPLY, DEMAND - [Philadelphia Inquirer, May 30.] Regulating markets so they are more efficient will always involve controversial issues and politically charged decisions.

CALIFORNIA'S DAVIS PRAISES BUSH DIRECTIVE ON NATURAL GAS - [Oil & Gas Journal, May 30.] California Gov. Gray Davis Tuesday praised President George W.

* * * DELIVERING ON THE STRATEGY - 


NewPower Conducting Three Innovative Energy-Saving Pilot Programs In Philadelphia To Help Consumers Control Their Energy Costs

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 31, 2001-- Some 300 Philadelphia households will soon participate in three pioneering pilot programs that will test consumer's reaction to energy saving technology. 

The programs will be launched next month by The New Power Company(TM), a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc., with technology and services provided by the Carrier Corporation, Shadowpack Inc., Coactive Networks, National Family Opinion Research (NFO) and Sargent Electric Company. 

The three pilots consisting of 100 households each will include: a time-of-use metering pilot; an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) load control pilot; and an interactive home gateway pilot. The interactive home gateway pilot will allow consumers to remotely access their thermostat from any Internet-enabled device. 

""As NewPower has advocated since its inception, energy restructuring leads to technological innovation, efficiency and environmental benefits,' said H. Eugene Lockhart, The New Power Company's president and chief executive officer.  ""These pilots are a wonderful example of control being shifted from the utility to the consumer. The nation's move to energy restructuring makes it possible for consumers to better manage their energy needs.""
 
Here are additional details on each of the three pilots: 
?	Participants in pilot program ``A'' will have time-of-use meters installed in their homes. These meters record daily energy use and will enable 		NewPower to better understand typical energy consumption patterns. 

?	In pilot program ``B,'' the HVAC load control pilot, Carrier's Comfortstat(TM) programmable thermostat will be installed in 100 homes. The purpose 	of this pilot is to gauge customers' reaction to having NewPower remotely alter their thermostat setting by 2 to 6 degrees to help the homeowner 		better manage their energy usage and costs. 

?	Under pilot program ``C,'' NewPower's remote energy management system will allow consumers to change their thermostat setting from any 		Internet-accessible device, including a PC, ``smart'' mobile phone or PDA. However, unlike pilot ``B,'' the customer always remains in control and 		may instantaneously override the adjustment at any time from the Web or a wireless device. 

Sargent Electric Company will install and service the energy management systems throughout the duration of the pilot programs. Their professional installers will complete the system installation in a matter of hours and provide helpful user instruction. 

The pilot programs will run from early June to the end of September -- the peak season for energy consumption. Homeowners are currently being recruited by NFO Research, and, as part of the pilot, will be asked to complete a number of short surveys about how they use the system and their feelings about new product concepts. 

Coactive Networks will provide the heart of the interactive home gateway system in pilot ``C.'' This first-of-its-kind technology uses home networking to enable real-time monitoring and control of devices over the Internet without requiring any new wires in the home. Shadowpack has built the system's Web and wireless user interfaces and will provide the back-end infrastructure necessary to carry out customer requests. Shadowpack's services allow for seamless connectivity from almost any Internet accessible device.

"RALLY AGAINT TERRORISM","                         MEDIA RELEASE
FROM: THE FATIMA CENTER, 266 Elmwood Ave., Buffalo, NY 14222
CONTACT: Coralie Graham, 905-871-7607 or coraliegraham@softcom.ca
OR WEBSITE: www.fatima.org
26 October 2001 - FOR RELEASE: IMMEDIATE

""RALLY AGAINST TERRORISM"" SET FOR NEW YORK
Mid-November prayer campaign targets 6 million Catholics

Thousands of Catholics in New York and around the world believe
that the terrorist attack against the World Trade Center was
prophesied by the Blessed Virgin Mary to three shepherd children
at Fatima, Portugal, on July 13th, 1917. A Rally Against
Terrorism, to be held at New York's Hotel Pennsylvania, from
Saturday, November 10th through Monday, November 12th, will offer
New Yorkers the chance to do something positive to make world
leaders listen to the Fatima Message.
     The Blessed Virgin Mary said, ""If My requests are not
granted ... the good will be martyred, the Holy Father will have
much to suffer, various nations will be annihilated."" According
to Father Nicholas Gruner, the ""Fatima Priest"", this foretells
tragic events like those of September 11th. ""This is it!"", he
says, ""This is what Our Lady tried to warn us about.""
     The Rally Against Terrorism is being held in New York
because, the organizers say, of the nearly 300 million Americans
who are at risk of annihilation, New Yorkers should be the most
aware of the death and destruction which can be rained on us from
the skies or delivered through the mail. The only thing we can do
to protect ourselves, they say, is to pray and campaign for
obedience to the Message of Fatima.
     Attenders at the rally will hear seven distinguished
speakers, including Father Gruner, explain the simple, step-by-
step instructions Our Lady gave us for averting an even worse
disaster. ""Everything else has been tried,"" the Fatima Priest
says. ""We have nothing to lose, and world peace to gain, by
insisting that the Pope and all the bishops do what Our Lady of
Fatima has commanded."" Participants will be urged to play their
part in making this happen.
     There will also be opportunities to join in Masses, Rosaries
and other prayerful devotions offered up in remembrance of those
who have died and for the protection of the living.
     Admission to the Rally Against Terrorism is free. Sessions
are scheduled from 8:45 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sunday
and Monday, November 10th through 12th, at New York's Hotel
Pennsylvania, 401 - 7th Avenue, between 32nd and 33rd Streets.
Further information can be found on the Fatima Website:
www.fatima.org.
                                                            - 30 -
NOTE TO MEDIA: We especially invite members of the press--
including electronic media as well as print- to attend and cover
the Rally Against Terrorism. For more information, contact Arthur
Skinner or Coralie Graham at the Fatima Center, telephone 1-866-
871-7723, or, outside North America, +1-905-871-7607, or e-mail

"RE: Nov. 2 Mtg of Exec Comm of Inst for Law & Tech","Hi Jim,

I'll make the arrangements for Henry Hu, and will let him know the
details.

Attached is the RSVP log to date for the November 2 meeting.  I've asked
George Kryder and Betsy Whitaker (the two we've not heard from yet) to
advise me of their plans ASAP.  The meeting looks like a ""go"", though
Tom Green, Anne McNamara and Joe Hubach won't be able to attend (Hubach
has an all day meeting but hopes to join us for drinks and dinner).

Anne McNamara wrote kindly in her RSVP that ""with this small a group
perhaps we could seek a convenient time before scheduling meetings in
the future"".

I'll send you for your review no later than Monday (1) a revised
proposed ""organizational plan"" (the written smorgasborg of options we
discussed last month), (2)a draft agenda for the meeting, and (3) a
draft cover memo from you to the ExComm members.  I recommend that we
send the approved versions of these on Tuesday or Wednesday via email.

From the press I'm reading every day, it sounds like you must be pretty
busy!

Let me know if there is anything else you want me to do in preparation
for the upcoming meeting.

Incidentally, we had an outstanding meeting of the IOGEC Executive
Committee last week.  I'll fill you in later.

David

FRIDAY, JUNE 8, 2001



NEWPOWER IN THE NEWS  -   
NEWPOWER TESTS CONSERVATION TOOLS - [Philadelphia Business Journal, May 31.] The next time you forget whether you left the thermostat on, there's a chance you could turn it off with your cell phone.   You could, that is, if you're from one of 300 households in Philadelphia that will participate in one of three pilot programs that will link electricity meters to the Internet. http://philadelphia.bcentral.com/philadelphia/stories/2001/05/28/daily27.html 

NEWPOWER SEES SAVINGS FROM SMART ENERGY TECHNOLOGY - [Reuters, June 1.] NewPower said it will conduct three pilot programs in Philadelphia to test consumers' reaction to ""smart"" energy saving technology.  These new products require ""smart""' meters that tell  a ""smart""' device to operate when the cost of generating electricity is cheapest?"" Energy restructuring leads to technological innovation, efficiency and environmental benefits,""' said H. Eugene Lockhart, NewPower's president and chief executive officer.  ""`These pilots are a wonderful example of control being shifted from the utility to the consumer. The nation's move to energy restructuring makes it possible for consumers to better manage their energy needs."" http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010601/n0179210.html

ENERGY-SAVING TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED IN PILOT PROGRAM - [Philadelphia Inquirer, June 1.] NewPower said it would launch three residential pilot programs in Philadelphia this month, to gauge consumer response to energy-saving technology.  The three programs will include 100 homes each and consist of a time-of-use metering pilot, a heating and air-conditioning control pilot, and a Web-based interactive pilot, which lets customers control their thermostat from any Web-enabled device. NewPower said it wanted to learn how consumers react to pricing and features of so-called demand-side management measures, and how to make them profitable. 	
NEWPOWER TO LEARN IMPACT OF HI-TECH METERS, CONTROLS ON CUSTOMERS LIVES - [Restructuring Today, June 1.] NewPower is taking the latest in DSM technology to the people in an effort to see how they react?.Tim Vail, NewPower's vice president of energy technology solutions, is not doing a technology beta test.   ""We want to learn consumer acceptance and responses to the products.""  A critical Vail target is learning how residential consumer lifestyles compare with load profiles so test volunteers will have to fill out a number of questionnaires about what they were doing at a given time.  The power industry has long bunched up ratepayers into classes using an average to picture typical use of customers.  ""We've got empirical data from a variety of sources but we want to get real world experience with it,"" Vail noted, a major departure from most metering pilots underway these days?""How do we take this technology and meld it into a product that consumers will want and use - that's the critical component of restructuring,"" he added?""Education is a major component of the whole piece for us,"" Vail said. 	

SAVING ENERGY IS HOT AGAIN - [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 3.] Not since the oil crisis of the 1970s has the public's interest in energy conservation seemed so high.  Even President Bush touts the value of conservation, despite criticism from environmentalists that his administration's policies rely too much on increased energy production and too little on energy efficiency and conservation. John Hangar, a former PUC member and current president of PennFuture, an environmental and consumer advocacy organization, wants electric utilities to install time-of-use meters in customers' homes. . . At least one company has leap-frogged over state regulators. NewPower began installing energy-saving technology in 300 households in the greater Philadelphia area.  ""These pilots are a wonderful example of control being shifted from the utility to the customer. The nation's move to energy restructuring makes it possible for consumers to better manage their energy costs,"" said H. Eugene Lockhart, NewPower's president and chief executive officer. http://www.post-gazette.com/businessnews/20010603conservebiz3.asp 

TWO MARKETERS CUT NATURAL GAS PRICES - [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 1.] Atlantans are getting a small break on their energy bills: Two leading Georgia natural gas marketers have reduced prices following a sharp drop in wholesale prices. No. 1 marketer Georgia Natural Gas Services reduced its variable price --- the price subject to monthly change --- for June by 4.5 percent. Shell Energy, the No. 3 marketer, marked down its fixed price, guaranteed for one year, by 5 percent and its variable price by 3 percent?NewPower, a new entrant in Georgia's unregulated natural gas market, is offering to lock in a gas price of 74.9 cents per therm for two years. That compares with one-year offers of 84.9 cents per therm from Georgia Natural Gas and 76.9 cents from Shell Energy. 

NEWPOWER TO START GAS SALES TO PG&E CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA - [Bloomberg, June 4.] NewPower is offering northern California residents two-year fixed-price natural-gas contracts to lure customers from PG&E Corp.'s gas utility.  In Sunnyvale, California, NewPower is offering is 98 cents a therm, or $9.80 per million British thermal units, and a $2.99 monthly fee, NewPower's Web site said. NewPower will offer gas service in 37 California counties, spokeswoman Gael Doar said. http://www.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?T=marketsquote99_news.ht&s=AOxv3sBTUTmV3UG93  

NATURAL GAS OFFERED AT FIXED RATE - [The Freemont Argus and Oakland Tribune, June 5] New York state-based NewPower is offering California residents a fixed-rate contract for natural gas, a commodity that saw big price spikes this past winter due to a supply shortage.  Residential customers in PG&E's service territory who commit to a two-year contract would pay 98 cents for each therm of natural gas. There would also be a monthly service fee of $2.99. http://www.argus-ang.com/default.asp?puid=16&spuid=16&indx=910116&article=on 

PRIX FIXE NATURAL GAS NOW AVAILABLE - [Contra Costa Times, June 5.]  With an offer of a two-year price guarantee, NewPower has set out to capture a portion of the retail natural gas market now served by the bankrupt utility unit of PG&E Corp. http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/leads/stories_one/enron_20010605.htm 

NEWPOWER OFFERS FIXED RATES - [Gas Daily, June 5.]  Gas customers in Pacific Gas & Electric's service territory can lock into a fixed rate with NewPower, a subsidiary of New Power Holdings.  The national gas and electric marketer yesterday began to offer  two-year fixed-rate to customers in several counties in Northern California.  ""NewPower is enormously pleased to provide California consumers, who've been buffeted by volatile energy prices, with a stable gas contract,"" said Eugene Lockhart, president and CEO of The New Power Co.
SELLING STABLE PRICES WORKS FOR NEWPOWER IN CALIFORNIA - [Restructuring Today, June 6.] Yes, the California market is open for retail gas competition.  It's been open for maybe a decade but few have found the market attractive until now.  NewPower is going in selling a two-year fixed price package that really appeals in today's world of price spiking. The fixed price insulates customers from price spikes in the volatile California marketplace. NewPower's Terri Cohen relates that the firm expects to sign up 16,000 customers.  They'll have the opportunity to lock in gas at 98? a therm, compared to an average PG&E price last January of $1.40 a therm.  The LDCs change their price monthly with a filing to the PUC based on what their costs have been.  NewPower's deal is available to retail customers in 37 northern California counties, including San Francisco and Sacramento. Before the announcement, NewPower already had 600,000 gas and electric customers in 19 markets.

OTHER ENERGY NEWS - NewPower shares news items weekly to inform employees about coverage of the energy industry.  Publication of a news clip is not an endorsement of its viewpoint or accuracy.

SURVEY SHOWS CUSTOMERS OVERWHELMINGLY FAVOR PRICE STABILITY - [Maxim Consulting Press Release, June 1.]  A nationwide survey shows that gas customers want their local gas utility to pursue strategies that will prevent future price spikes. The survey results also suggest ways for utilities to regain customer loyalty diminished in the wake of last winter's price increases. The results of the survey were recently presented to a group of utility executives and regulators at the New England Conference of Public Utilities Commissions. The survey shows that customers overwhelmingly prefer programs that mitigate price volatility, such as fixed price and capped price programs. http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=CoXCtqbWbtKvgmdi0&FQ=%22maxim%20consulting%22&Nav=na-search-&StoryTitle=%22maxim%20consulting%22 

SHELL UNIT SIGNS DEAL ON NATURAL GAS PRICES - [Cleveland Plain Dealer, June 2.] Shell Energy Services Inc. yesterday became the next big player in Northeast Ohio's quickly changing utility services industry.  The Texas-based subsidiary of Shell Energy signed a one-year deal with Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council to provide discounted natural gas to customers in NOPEC communities across eight counties, beginning in September. http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/xml/story.ssf/html_standard.xsl?/base/news/991474210115554.xml 

9 CITIES UNITE FOR GREATER MIGHT  - [Boston Globe, June 3.] Imagine if nine Massachusetts cities combined their muscle to lower their health-care premiums and energy costs, and unify plans for affordable housing and developing jobs.  Those are among the hopes of city leaders who participated in a new cooperative effort that kicked off Wednesday.  At the meeting, officials from Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Medford, Melrose, Revere, and Somerville discussed ways their communities might be able to better work together. Possible areas of collaboration include joint purchasing and forging common strategies. http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/154/north/9_cities_unite_for_greater_mightP.shtml 

ON BUSH'S BRAND OF ENERGY DIVERSITY - [TIME.Com, June 4.] The Bush administration's national energy policy is meant to stimulate a national debate. It is certainly doing that. Whatever you believe about its recommendations, the report is a surprisingly well-crafted overview of America's energy situation. http://www.time.com/time/business/printout/0,8816,128829,00.html 

THE BATTLE OF CALIFORNIA - [Newsweek, June 4.] There are two dueling storylines for California's energy crisis. In the Gray Davis version a noble public servant who inherited a flawed electricity deregulation scheme from his Republican predecessor is trying to defend California's shellshocked consumers against the depredations of greedy ""out of state"" energy producers and an uncaring White House. In the Republican scenario, a desperate politician, worried about his falling poll numbers, is trying to shift the blame to the White House. http://www.msnbc.com/news/582445.asp#BODY

ELECTRICITY USAGE SHRINKS BY 11% - [San Francisco Chronicle, June 4.] By turning off lamps, turning up thermostats and buying energy-efficient light bulbs, the people of California helped reduce the state's electricity consumption last month 11 percent below the May 2000 level, more than was expected, Davis administration officials said yesterday. 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/06/04/MN183543.DTL 

BINGAMAN, SENATE ENERGY CHIEF, WILL BLOCK BUSH PRODUCTION PLAN - [Bloomberg, June 5.] Bush opposes caps on energy prices; Bingaman is cosponsor of legislation to impose caps on wholesale energy prices in California although, according to a spokesman, he'd prefer the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission do that on its own. 
Bingaman says rather than offer his own plan now, he'll try to sit down with Republicans and negotiate something both sides can agree on. http://quote.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?ptitle=Energy%20News&s1=blk&tp=ad_topright_energy&refer=topfin&T=markets_bfgcgi_content99.ht&s2=blk&bt=ad_position1_energy&middle=ad_frame2_energy&s=AOxxZjBXlQmluZ2Ft 


PREPAID POWER PROPOSED - [Associated Press, June 5.] Operators of the region's electricity grid recommended yesterday that consumers pay extra to ensure that New England has enough electricity generation capacity.  Federal regulators had ordered the new charge in December -- even though New England now has plenty of generation capacity -- but a court challenge has kept it from being implemented. The rate would go into effect July 1, if approved by federal regulators.  The proposal requires companies that buy electricity from generators to pay those generators to maintain enough extra capacity to accommodate peak demand.  If the companies don't pay enough for extra capacity, they are forced to pay a ""deficiency charge."" http://www.telegram.com/news/page_one/10nelectric1.html 

ALARMED CALIFORNIANS CUT ELECTRIC POWER USE - [Washington Post, June 6.] Fearful of blackouts and expensive utility bills, Californians have begun conserving electricity at a rate the state has rarely seen.  New figures show that California residents and businesses reduced power consumption by 11 percent in May. http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/157/nation/Alarmed_Californians_cut_electric_power_use+.shtml 

CONSUMERS LAG ON ELECTRIC PRICE CURVE - [CBS MarketWatch, June 6.] Up to now, many California electricity users have been opening their monthly bills and muttering to themselves: ""What energy crisis?""  Of course there have been periodic blackouts for some, and many utility customers have seen their bills rise. But a sizable number of consumers have not seen a big change in their electric bills.   That's all about to change. And it's just in time, because wholesale electricity prices are coming down but state-approved energy increases are taking effect. http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?print=1&guid={AD628F25-0EB8-4EA4-A8FB-E1617477E3D0}&siteid=yhoo 


MEDIA QUOTE OF THE WEEK:  ""What's more beneficial, move forward on the larger agenda or trudge around through the mud on this? Why beat our heads against the wall on price caps when we'll never be any closer on it?  If we moved forward, it would look like a partisan bloodbath.""  - A GOP Aide, CNN, June 6, 2001 http://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/06/06/congress.energy/index.html 

JUST 9 DAYS 'TIL FATHER'S DAY - THINK NEWPOWER - If you're planning on buying Dad a tie this Father's Day, you're still living in the '90's.  Instead, consider buying a gift that focuses on a more pressing, ""2001"" topic he will appreciate - energy efficiency and savings.
Saving on energy and energy efficiency have been a concern for most Dads, and ""shut off the lights, I'm not made of money"" has been roared by Dads nationwide. NewPower offers some Father's Day gift ideas that will light up his life:
The Power Planner allows the family to save energy when using even the most energy-hungry appliances. A plug that is simple to use (just plugs into a wall outlet), it can reduce the energy usage of some motorized appliances by up to 23 percent.   It's great for the refrigerator, window air conditioning unit or gas clothes dryer.  It's only $39.95, plus shipping and handling.  It will pay for itself.
MoleculAir? Filters slip into the home heating and cooling systems where they capture allergy-causing particles, dust, pollen, pet dander and dirt that contaminate the air and clog the heating and cooling systems, often causing them to expend more energy.  As an added service, Dad will get a bi-monthly reminder (by mail or e-mail) to change the filters.  The price of the filters runs from $39.95 to $59.95, plus shipping and handling.
The EnergyPack offers 300-watts of portable power.  Whether Dad is boating, camping, indoors or outoors, he has a rechargeable generator (think portable outlet) with him.  He can use it to jump-start his car or to recharge his cell phone.  It's small enough to carry with him, yet powerful enough to run his laptop for seven hours.  It is $159.95 plus shipping and handling (a more powerful, 600-watt EnergyPack is also available for $279.95).
It's not to late to order these items in time for Father's Day.  Call 1-866-NEWPOWER.  NewPower is the innovative energy source consumers can trust.

OF INTEREST * * * J.P. Morgan (JPM) has introduced a report launching its small-cap strategy (a small cap stock is defined by JPM as one with less than $3 billion in capitalization). The report provides small-cap stock picks, insights and data to leverage JPM analysts' views.  The first report (5/16/01) was titled ""The Inefficient Frontier"" because JPM believes that small caps are often poorly followed, leading to inefficiencies from which astute investors can profit.   The report's ""Trading Recommended List"" includes 25 stocks that JPM considers ""best-positioned companies"" poised for immediate appreciation, with a 12-month upside potential of at least 30 percent (turnover on the list occurs as warranted).  Among the 25 stocks on the list is NPW, The New Power Company, the only stock under the industry listing for ""Electric Companies."" 
Please note, news such as this is included in POWER BRIEFS to inform employees about the performance of and ""word on the Street"" about our stock.  NewPower does not endorse any one brokerage firm.

"Access to corporate data sheets at weekend","I've instigated the following change:  instead of running the report to update the online corporate data sheets each weekend which frequently means that no data sheets are available until Monday, I've requested they be run on Thursday evening to be ready by Friday morning.  This way anybody working over the weekend will have the data sheets.  Of course we continue to be available for data not accessible through the data sheets.  Hope this helps a little.

TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE
News from The University of Texas at Austin
____________________________________________
Dear Texas Tribute reader:
This is the first issue of TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE, a monthly e-newsletter offering brief items of interest from the UT Austin campus. Some items will include a link you can click on for a complete story while others will stand alone.
You are receiving TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE because of your interest in and support of UT. Like the printed version of Texas Tribute, the online edition's primary goal is to highlight the enormous impact of philanthropy at the University, and other interesting items will occasionally be part of the mix.
We hope you enjoy TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE, but if you do not wish to receive future issues, simply reply to this message and type REMOVE in the subject field to be removed from our distribution list. Thank you.
And now, on to the news:
TEXAS ICON HERB KELLEHER, founder and chairman of the board of Southwest Airlines (but not a UT alumnus), has given UT's McCombs School of Business $4 million to fund the Herb Kelleher Center for Entrepreneurship. The center, charged with creating the country's leading academic program focused on entrepreneurship, is cleared for take-off and will begin offering classes this spring. There is no word yet on whether the McCombs School will increase its supply of cocktail napkins -- the medium Herb used to sketch out Southwest's first business plan.--> SEE http://www.bus.utexas.edu/news/pressreleases/kelleher.asp
THIRTEEN GIFTED AND AMBITIOUS SCHOLARS from as far away as Spain are calling UT home this year as the inaugural class of the prestigious new Harrington Fellows Program for distinguished faculty and graduate students. ""As we had hoped, the program has enabled us to attract some of the world's best minds,"" says UT President Larry R. Faulkner. ""They bring with them tremendous talent, knowledge, and experiences.""--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/do/impact/harrington.html
IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY to Robert Dedman and the Rev. Jim Fenner that they were UT Law School classmates and fellow members of the Tejas Club, but it was more than 50 years ago. In 1948, Jim loaned Robert $800 to buy a car so that he could get a better job. After a year of selling real estate and insurance, Robert paid Jim $880 - the loan in full plus 10 percent interest. Jim refused the extra $80, saying he wasn't trying to make money on the loan, just help a Tejas brother in need. Robert, who never forgot the gesture, has honored Jim and the bonds of Tejas brothers by endowing a $100,000 Tejas scholarship fund in Jim's name.
For further news and information about UT Austin, visit our home page:--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/
Your feedback is both welcome and appreciated. Please let us know what we can do to improve TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE for you.

"Institute for Law and Technology Executive Committee meeting","Hi Jim,

Well, it's been quite a month!  I hope the dust is clearing for you a
little bit, at least.

The results of our email poll of Executive Committee members for our
inaugural meeting are as follows:

a)  Friday, January 11, 2002 -- all can make it except McNamara, Kryder
and (maybe) Green;

b)  Friday, January 18, 2002 -- all can make it except Kryder and
(maybe) Green;

c)  Wednesday, January 23, 2002 -- all can make it except (maybe) Green.

Shall we go ahead and nail down the meeting date and circulate it so the
folks can lock it in on their calendars?  What day do you choose?

Thank you so much for finding the time to manage this matter, as you
have, amid all the other matters on your plate.

David

"Misc re Institute & Law School Foundation","Dear Mr. Derrick:

	Thank you for your e-mails.  It would be wonderful if we did get a chance
to meet in person while you're in Austin - whether you're here in
connection with this upcoming Law School Foundation meeting or here later
on for some other reason.

	Of course, at a minimum, I hope to be able to come to the
to-be-newly-scheduled meeting of the Institute for Law & Technology and
meet you there.  Yesterday, I received the 10/29/01 memo from David
Ellwanger and the accompanying binder.  There is a reference on page 27 of
the binder to a preliminary plan for the Institute that has been developed
by David Winn.  Would it make sense for this preliminary plan to be
circulated to committee members ahead of time?

	Incidentally, I read this morning of Bill's election to Enron's board - as
you know, he is outstanding.

	Best regards.

Dear Senator Leahy:

        I am Chairman of the Committee of Corporate General Counsel, which
is part of the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association. Our
membership is comprised of the senior-most legal officers of many of
America's largest companies.

        Our members have asked me to write to you, in your capacity as
Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to express our views concerning
the importance of the Federal Judiciary.

        The tragic events of September 11 underscore for all of us the
freedoms that we enjoy in our country. We know that you and your fellow
Senators on the Judiciary Committee are devoted to helping protect these
precious freedoms. We also know that you and your fellow Senators recognize
the critical importance of our system of justice in preserving and
protecting these freedoms.

        We write to express our thanks to you and your colleagues for your
efforts in reviewing the qualifications of individuals nominated for
Federal
District Court and Circuit Court positions. Recognizing the need for a
fully-staffed Federal Judiciary, we also appreciate all your efforts in
determining the qualifications of nominees for the Judiciary as
expeditiously as possible.

         If our organization, or any of our members, may ever be of
assistance in any way, I hope you will call upon us. Thank you.


                                        Sincerely,

Sorry, I gave a bum lead....... as the facts unfold, it looks like this deal relates to a Volumetric Production Payment transaction  and equity investment done out of Scott Josey's group...the properties involved are located in Utah and Colorado..............the ""Crescendo entity"" is managed by non-Enron personnel.  From my discussions with Scott Josey this a. m., it appears that Crescendo management has been using outside local counsel to determine the relative rights as between Crescendo who owns the oil and gas rights and Sullivan who holds the helium rights via a lease arrangement with the BLM............Andy Edison, as of this morning, is on-point according to Scott Josey....Scott Josey's group is an ENA group.

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

Gentlemen:

Attached are NPW drafts of the Form 8-K and Press Release.

Marc Manly called this evening to indicate that he will try to get Business Review Committee (BRC) sign-off on the Transaction by the end of the day tomorrow (hopefully earlier), followed by a short NPW Board meeting or, in lieu thereof, the circulation of a Unanimous Written Consent.  I questioned whether the Enron directors should recuse themselves from the Board meeting ( I believe they should do so, although they could be present for quorum purposes) and how any recusal would affect a Consent (in lieu of a Board meeting).  Joe, do you have any thoughts here, given the circumstances.  In addition, Marc and I have signed-off on the BRC resolutions (which are being circulated for execution), and I will review tonight the latest draft of the Board resolutions that I just received.

I am providing a copy of this E-Mail to Mark Koenig for his information from an Enron IR perspective.

     I attach the current versions of a form 8-K and associated press
release, assuming the Business Review Committee and the Board approve the
transactions.  Gene is reviewing these documents and may have additional
comments.  Please provide any comments and I will recirculate another draft
reflecting all comments received.  As indicated in the 8-K, we would intend
to include the press release as a filed exhibit to the 8-K.

     We are attempting to finalize the underlying deal documents tonight so
that they may be submitted to the BRC.  Unless there is a problem with
using resolutions by unanimous consent (e.g., the Enron directors must
recuse themselves and thus the resolutions can only pass by means of a live
board meeting), we are tending toward board action by unanimous consent.
We will explore if that is a problem, and if so, will call a telephonic
meeting at the earliest time we can obtain a quorum.

AES in Dispute with State in India

U.S.-Based AES Corp. Complains About Getting Paid by Indian State

By RAJESH MAHAPATRA 
Associated Press Writer

NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- AES Corp., a U.S. energy company, is seeking the Indian prime minister's help to settle a dispute over power production with a state government.

In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES president Dennis W. Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India was being tested by the government of the eastern Orissa state.

The letter, a copy of which was made available to The Associated Press on Tuesday, was dated Oct. 1 and appeared to have been faxed to the office of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

AES and another major American power company, Enron Corp. (NYSE:ENE  - news ), have made big investments in India after the government allowed foreign investment in the power sector in the early 1990s.

Houston-based Enron has had problems getting paid for power produced at the plant it helped build in India.

AES, based in Arlington, Va., operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49 percent of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state.

In his letter, Bakke told Vajpayee that AES has faced ``expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation ... and direct interference with day-to-day management'' by the state government and its agencies. The letter also complained about government-run agencies failing to pay 2.1 billion rupees ($44 million) in bills.

``If the situation faced by AES is not remedied urgently, it will undermine the trust and confidence of foreign investors in India,'' Bakke wrote. ``While AES still remains committed to India as a country it would very much like to serve, our determination to continue is being tested.''

AES has already offered to withdraw from the distribution company -- known as the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa. However, it has said that the company will continue with its interests in electricity generation.

The prime minister's office said it was not ready to comment on the report.

In Bhubaneshwar, an Orissa energy department official said when it was persuading AES to continue in the CESCO, the state government had given a verbal commitment that AES would be given an additional 2 percent stake, making the energy firm a major shareholder in the company.

However, the Orissa government had not been able to fulfill its commitment, the official said speaking on condition of anonymity.

If AES decides to pull out completely, it will be the third American company to do so.

Cogentrix Inc. quit a power project in southern India before it was started, while Enron is in the process of withdrawing from the Dabhol Power Project in western Maharashtra state, India's biggest ever foreign investment project.

On Sept. 14, Enron chairman Kenneth L. Lay wrote a letter to Vajpayee threatening legal action to pursue claims of up to $5 billion relating to the Dabhol Power Co. dispute and questioned India's ability to honor its contracts.

Lay had also warned that India may find it hard to attract foreign investors in the future because of the payment dispute with the Dabhol project, which stopped production and construction in May.

"Enron Middle East","Dear Sir:

My understanding is that Mr. Rick Bergsieker and you are the only directors
of Enron Middle East, Ltd., and that Mr. Darrin Donegan is the current local
manager of this company.  I also understand that Mr. Bergsieker is not with
Enron any more, Enron Middle East is still solvent, and it has very limited
indebtedness, other than my outstanding expense claims.

PLEASE READ ON.

I was an employee of Enron from 9 September 1999 to 5 December 2001 and from
1 February 2001 to the end, my Enron employer was Enron Middle East.  During
this time, I incurred business related expenses with the prior knowledge and
approval of my supervisors totaling US$90,000.  I have duly filed and had
approved these expense claims, but unfortunately have not received the
reimbursement yet.  Mr. Clay Harris was my last boss and he is still with
Enron (clay.harris@enron.com, EGM LNG team, London).  Ms. Kim Hickok
(kim.hickok@enron.com) is the current EGM HR person and has the full
documentation relating to the claim.

PLEASE READ ON.

Albeit very limited, Enron Middle East does have some assets.  I plead with
you to instruct Mr. Donegan to sell Enron Middle East's assets reimburse my
pre-agreed, appropriately lodged, and duly approved expense claims, whose
non-payment has been ruinous for my family.

I thank you for your help at these difficult times.

"Request for standing order for Insinger de Beaufort/Equity Trust","Insinger de Beaufort / Equity Trust Co. N.V.
This Netherlands company is the corporate manager for our Dutch international corporations, appx. 120.  They hold all the corporate records of these entities and they will not release them nor will they perform any services until they are paid. In addition I understand from Tim DeSpain that they are holding Treasury funds pending payment of fees, and that he is pursuing this issue too.   Equity Trust acts as the sole Director for these companies which means that only Equity Trust can sign corporate documents on behalf of these companies.  They prepare and register all necessary filings (numerous) with the Companies Register and advise us and keep us in line on Dutch corporate law. They will not advise us on Dutch bankruptcy proceeding requirements until we make good on the outstanding amount. 

Outstanding fees total EUR 173,595.16 which equals appx. US$154,309 plus we would need a float going forward so that they could draw from it.

Invoices are up to 12 months old and many of them are the responsibility of Enron Europe group.

None of the companies involved has filed for bankruptcy.

"Career Opportunities at Enron","

Dear Mr. Derrick:

     Les LoBaugh suggested that I contact you to inquire about an in-house
counsel position at Enron. I am the General Counsel of Niagara Mohawk Holding's
unregulated subsidiaries, Niagara Mohawk Energy, Inc. and Niagara Mohawk Energy
Marketing, Inc. We expect the sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing to close
in November or December of this year, pending FERC approval, and a sale of
Niagara Mohawk Energy's Distributed Power and Energy Services Business units may
occur contemporaneously with that closing. Therefore, I am now pursuing other
career opportunities.

     I am a good candidate for an in-house counsel position at Enron because of
my 12 years experience as an attorney in the energy industry. As General Counsel
for the Company, I provide legal services and business advise to senior
management and the Board of Directors of both the energy marketing and the
energy services subsidiaries. My experience includes drafting and negotiating
gas and electric retail sales agreements and master agreements and related
documents for wholesale energy trading and marketing transactions, including
physical transactions and financial instruments such as swaps. I monitor and I
am responsible for representing my company in FERC and state regulatory
proceedings. I keep up to date on the fast moving events and trends in the
energy marketing and trading industry by closely monitoring regulatory
proceedings, reading information that is published in trade and related energy
industry publications and my involvement with the National Energy Marketers
Association and the Federal Energy Bar Association. I am also responsible for
representing the company and managing outside counsel in litigation and
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. My experience includes utility
regulatory and legal matters, the transactional work associated with corporate
mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, human resource/employee issues,
interconnection agreements, municipal law, leasing, financing and secured
transaction agreements, commercial contracts, condemnation litigation and real
property matters.

     I have attached my resume for your review. Please contact me at your
earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing from
you soon.

     Thank you for your consideration.

                         Very truly yours,
                         Steven R. Pincus

"FW: Enron Lawyers","Jim -- Per our discussion, I gave Mary Flood the attorney numbers at Enron, mainly because she had credible research anyway and our number was actually a little lower. She also has a prominent lawyer in town quoted as saying that he has always viewed us as one of the major law firms in town, which is really all she needs.  My guess is we won't like this story, but it is very difficult to reel someone in on speculating about layoffs in one function when we all know what's coming companywide.

Thanks Jim.

"November 2 Executive Committee meeting","TO: The Executive Committee of the Institute for Law and Technology

FROM: James V. Derrick, Jr., Chair

RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have determined
to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date. I
hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have already
made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
<mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of your
availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

a)  Friday, January 11, 2002

b)  Friday, January 18, 2002

c)  Wednesday, January 23, 2002

After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting for
the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members and
notify you of the new date.

Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that we
have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.

Paula -- we've received written questions from the New York Times for a weekend story.  I need your assistance on the following:

Why, in securities filings this year, did Enron describe its principal business as ""security brokers, dealers & flotation"" when before it had said it was in the business of ""wholesale-petroleum & petroleum products""?

Has the board taken any action in regard to the events of the past week? 

Have they called any special meetings?  formed any special committee? 

Have they hired an attorney to review the situation? 

I know you have several meetings today, but when you get a chance, would you give me a call or email me? 

Thanks, Paula!

Jarek

We were having some retention problems with Jacek for a variety of reasons.  After discussion in London we decided to increase his package.

I believe it is highly unlikely that Jacek would be interested in working out of the Warsaw office for Enron Poland.

The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

I have discussed this with Jacek.  The reason for increasing Jacek's package is retention.

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, ""I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?""

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.

Chuck Cheek tells us that his Litigation Group should not receive these letters and will not be directly involved. 

We are just trying to ascertain to whom (individual/department/outside counsel) should this mail be directed.  

When we get an answer, we will pass the word and give the mailroom proper instructions.  It is my understanding that many of the officers on 50 also are receiving these letters.  We will need to notify all of the proper procedure.

"News from Liberal Arts","Dear Friends,

It has been more than a month since our lives were changed. September 11 has taken a terrible toll.  The size of that toll remains to be seen. The College has responded in a way to make all of us proud.  Students, faculty and staff have banded together and given of themselves in an effort to cope with this tragedy.  Nearly 12,000 of us gathered on the South Mall to participate in a moving ceremony of sympathy and resolve. We are changed but not detained from our purpose-to educate one another and thereby to try to make sense of the world in which we find ourselves. Teaching young people is a wonderful balm.

We have all been touched by the catastrophic actions in New York, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania--some more directly than others. Here on campus, we have been struggling to return to our normal lives while we serve as a source of strength and reason for our students, as well as for each other. I hope this finds you and your family safe and well.


Upcoming events

If you are interested in participating in the online discussions, you can find them at http://www.drc.utexas.edu/e306web/forums.cfm. McPhee will read from his book at the Texas Union Ballroom at 8pm on November 8.  This event is free and open to the public.

TARL LAUNCHES NEW WEBSITE
For those of you with an interest in Texas history, you'll be pleased to see a new public education website, Texas Beyond History, that has been launched by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). The new website can be found at http://www.utexas.edu/research/tarl/tbh/index.html, and showcases information and images about Texas cultural heritage-more than 13,000 years of human history-from Clovis to cotton farmers. For the first time, the public, especially school children and teachers, will have access to the most important of TARL's scientific holdings through online virtual museum ""exhibits"" and a variety of creative resources including map tools, children's activities, an illustrated glossary and lesson plans. This is the first website of its kind anywhere in the country.

FACULTY
As always, we are very proud of the achievements of our faculty. Here are just a few of the newsworthy announcements on that front.
** CATHARINE ECHOLS, OF THE PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT, has been appointed to serve as a member of the Biobehavioral and Behavioral Processes Study Section of the National Institutes of Health.
** R. J. HANKINSON, OF THE PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENT, has been selected as editor of ""Apeiron: A Journal for Ancient Philosophy and Science.""
 You may have also seen several faculty members on national television lately:
** LIZA SHAPIRO OF ANTHROPOLOGY appeared in the PBS series ""Evolution"" on Sept. 25.
** JULIET WALKER, A NEW PROFESSOR OF HISTORY, was a guest on ""Larry King Live"" on Sept. 4 to discuss her upcoming book on Oprah Winfrey.
** SUMIT GANGULY, GOVERNMENT AND ASIAN STUDIES, has been on CNN, ""Marketplace,"" ""The News Hour,"" and many international radio and print media discussing the political situation in Pakistan and India.
** HOWARD MILLER, OF THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT, has been awarded the Liberal Arts Council Teaching Award. The recipient of this award, in recognition of excellence in teaching, is chosen by student members of the Council.
** WILLIAM GOETZMANN, AMERICAN STUDIES, will receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Texas Book Festival on Nov. 17. First Lady Laura Bush is scheduled to present the award to Prof. Goetzmann in the House Chambers of the Texas House of Representatives.

** PAUL WOODRUFF, PLAN II AND PHILOSOPHY, recently had two books published, ""Reverence"" and a translation of Sophocles' ""Antigone.""

THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST
Our students are making the news as well. The October issue of ""Glamour"" magazine features RICHA GULATI as one of the Top 10 College Women of 2001. Richa is a Plan II major and a winner of the Truman Scholarship. In addition, Richa and fellow Liberal Arts student ANDREW FRIEDBERG, a Government/Economics/Finance major, were honored as the University's Outstanding Students for this academic year.

We are also very pleased to announce this year's winners of the Larry Temple Scholarship. RICHARD COFER II, History and Government major, and MARGARET PORTER, Liberal Arts Honors, are the recipients of this award. Another recent scholarship winner is FRANCISCO JOSE BENAVIDES. Francisco, majoring in Italian and English, is one of only two winners of a scholarship from the Italian American Foundation.

On Oct. 20, the Texas Exes awarded their Distinguished  Alumnus Awards for 2001 (http://www.texasexes.org/news.php3?id=56), and no less than five of the six honorees hold Liberal Arts degrees:

R. Gordon Appleman (BA '59)
Betty Sue Flowers (BA '69, MA '70)
Ricardo Hinojosa (BA '72)
Joe R.  Long  (BA '51)
and
Jon P. Newton (BA '63)

On the same evening, Prof. William S. Livingston,  Senior  Vice President of The University, Professor  of  Government, former Acting President of The University, was awarded the Distinguished Service Award by the Exes (http://www.texasexes.org/press.php3?pr=4).  This is only the second time that this award has  been made.

Congratulations to each of these distinguished alums, friends, and colleagues.


UT MYTHOLOGY
One of the recurring myths about UT is that the classes are all huge.  Here is the breakdown on class size in the College of Liberal Arts for this semester:

Enrollment	Number	Percent
1-30		936	74%
31-75		170	13%
76-100		51	4%
100-200		55	4%
Over 200	56	4%
Total		1268	100%

We are working hard to reduce the number of classes with more than 75 students, but we are proud of the fact that nearly three-fourths of our classes have 30 students or less.

Let us hear from you.

"Rogers Award Ceremony Sponsorship","To the Executive Committee:

Ted has advised that Exxon Mobil prefers that the sponsors for the
Rogers Award ceremony (reception and dinner) not be drawn solely from
firms which represent Exxon Mobil.  I intend to contact as many as three
firms which do a substantial amount of work for Exxon Mobil --
Fulbright, Akin Gump and Baker Botts -- but I need to identify one or
two other sponsors for the event, which will be held at the Petroleum
Club of Houston, February 21, 2002.  The total financial sponsorship we
seek is $15,000, which should almost cover the direct out of pocket
costs of the event.  So, the amount of contributions needed (which
should be equally shared among the co-sponsors) will be $7,500 each if
we go with only two sponsors, or $5,000 if we go with three co-sponsors,
or $3,750 if we go with four co-sponsors.

Please advise me ASAP (this week) whether your firm or organization is
interested in co-sponsoring the event this year, in any of the above
amounts.  The reason I'd like to hear from you this week is that I'd
like to include recognition of the sponsors in the Institute brochure if
possible, and it is about ready to go to the printer.  To help you
discuss the possibility of sponsorship with your partners, further info
about the Rogers Award and the benefits of sponsorship follows below.

In the last two years, the ceremony has been a gala affair in the
evening on the first night of the Institute, including a reception and
dinner, instead of the Institute luncheon event of prior years.  As in
prior years, attendance at the ceremony was included in the tuition for
the Institute, so all Institute attendees were invited to attend without
further cost and most of them did.  Since membership on our Advisory
Board includes tuition-free attendance at the Institute, all Advisory
Board members are also invited to attend the ceremony without charge and
many of them did.  Attendees have been invited to bring spouses or other
guests, but there has been a $100 charge for guests.

In 2000, we honored Sir John Browne at the Hall of State in Dallas; the
reception was sponsored by Jones Day, which contributed $7,500 for the
reception.  In 2001, we honored Ken Lay at the Institute of Texan
Cultures in San Antonio;  the reception was sponsored by Vinson &
Elkins, which contributed $7,500 for the reception.

The actual out of pocket expense for the entire 2001 event was over
$16,000.

This year, as you know, we are endeavoring to make the Oil and Gas
Institute (including the Rogers Award ceremony), like all CAIL programs,
self-sufficient financially.  Attendance at the award ceremony will
again be included in the Institute tuition and all Advisory Board
members will again be invited to attend cost-free as well.  Because we
are honoring Lee Raymond, we want to continue the recent tradition of
presenting the award at a gala evening event.  Accordingly, we'd like to
obtain sponsorships for the Rogers Award ceremony (reception and dinner)
this year of $15,000.

For their financial contribution, sponsoring firms will get: (a)
sponsorship recognition/publicity at the Rogers Award event in the form
of a welcome sign, in the written event program and orally from the
podium, (b) sponsorship recognition in literature at the Institute, and
probably oral announcements from the Institute podium, (c) recognition
in our annual list of contributors to the Institute for Energy Law (how
does that new name sound to you?) in our CAIL annual report, and (d) the
right to invite several guests to the event, in addition to the firm's
attorneys who may already be attending the Institute.  I'd like to also
include (e) recognition/publicity in the Institute brochure, which will
be mailed to about 40,000 attorneys nation-wide.  To get this additional
recognition in the brochure, however, as I said, we need to confirm the
sponsor(s) this week, hence my request to hear from you, if you are
interested, ASAP (ideally today or tomorrow so I'll have time to line up
the other co-sponsors before the publication deadline).

As our Membership Committee advised at the October meeting, many firms
welcome sponsorship opportunities such as this as good marketing for the
firm.  In this case, it is also an opportunity to help celebrate Lee
Raymond's outstanding career in the oil and gas industry, to help
continue the Annual Institute's tradition of excellence in oil and gas
law education, and to help the Institute for Energy Law grow into its
new name.

Though not mandatory, I would hope that the sponsor(s) will either be or
become members of the Institute for Energy Law.

In short, please let me know ASAP if your firm or organization is
willing to co-sponsor the Rogers Award ceremony this year.

On two related matters, I'm happy to report that Strasburger & Price has
offered to sponsor the Deans of Oil and Gas Practice Lecture Luncheon on
Friday this year in the amount of $4,000 (thanks, Stuart) and Jones Day
Reavis & Pogue has offered to sponsor as an experiment for the Institute
a networking lunch (no speaker) on Thursday in the amount of $4,000
(thanks, Brad).  I'm also happy to report that the Institute program and
faculty this year are excellent, and that the program will again include
several new features developed by the Institute co-chairs (thanks, Brad
and Jack).

Sorry for making this request at the last minute, but I'd like to see
the sponsors recognized in the Institute brochure, as well as in the
other ways mentioned, and I also want to get the brochure to the printer
this week.  I certainly understand if this is too short notice to get
the necessary approvals so quickly.  If we can't get the necessary
sponsors identified this week, we'll go ahead and print the brochure
without this recognition and the sponsors will receive our recognition
and thanks in the other ways mentioned.

Thanks much.

David

Subject:	Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

While one paragraph states that normal destruction policies are suspended it states in the next paragraph to retain only ones related LJM.  My interpretation is ""preserve anything to do with LJM and if you are unsure preserve anything you think is related to LJM until you can verify"".

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers
are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM
partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests
in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to
preserve documents that might be used in the litigation.

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended
immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings,
e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way
relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2,
including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any
transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and
Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a
requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil
and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the
meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with
anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

EPA NOMINEE URGES CAREFUL BALANCING OF ACCESS TO
INFORMATION, SECURITY

President Bush's choice to become EPA's chief information
officer tells a Senate committee that public access to EPA
data will have to be more carefully balanced with growing
concerns that such data could be of use to terrorists. ""I've
always been a very staunch advocate for public access to
information,"" Kimberly Terese Nelson tells the Senate
Environmental and Public Works Committee. ""However, Sept. 11
did change some things."" EPA's Office of Environmental
Information has removed general risk management information
from the agency's Web site and is reviewing manuals and
information products for data that could compromise national
security. . . . Page A-1

1,100 ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS CALL FOR DEEP CUTS IN POWER PLANT
EMISSIONS

A coalition of 1,100 national and local environmental groups
plans to release principles today emphasizing large cuts in
power plant pollution--a sign the groups are not willing to
compromise on legislation introduced by Sen. Jeffords that
is opposed by the Bush administration and industry groups.
The release of the principles comes as Jeffords, chairman of
the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, is
planning a hearing next week on his legislation (S. 556),
which calls for major reductions in power plant emissions of
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide
by 2007. . . . Page A-1

RESEARCHER SUGGESTS USING EMISSIONS TRADING TO CUT POWER
PLANT POLLUTION

If emission allowances for power plant pollution are
distributed through a government-led auction among electric
utilities, the cost of carbon reductions would be
dramatically reduced, suggests a researcher. . . . Page A-11

EPA CLOSE TO COMPLETING PROPOSAL ON RECYCLING OF CATHODE RAY
TUBES

EPA is close to completing long awaited rules on recycling
cathode ray tubes and disposing of solvent-contaminated shop
towels and wipes, according to the director of EPA's Office
of Solid Waste, Elizabeth Cotsworth. She says the rules on
cathode ray tubes, aimed at removing some of the regulatory
barriers industry faces in recycling the tubes, are headed
to the White House Office of Management and Budget for
review. Cathode ray tubes are major sources of lead and
mercury in the country's waste stream. . . . Page A-2

SNOWE INTRODUCES BILL TO REQUIRE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS
OF TRUCKERS

Companies that transport hazardous materials would have to
conduct background investigations of drivers and document
the drivers' identities under legislation introduced by Sen.
Snowe.  Employers would have to obtain fingerprints and
photographs of job applicants and conduct criminal
background checks on applicants for jobs with access to very
sensitive hazardous materials. Immigration and
naturalization service records also would have to be
reviewed under provisions in Snowe's bill (S. 1557).
""Federal authorities already recommend that companies hiring
drivers conduct these tests, and my legislation will simply
make this a mandatory requirement,"" Snowe says. . . . Page

DOE SELECTS PROCESS FOR SEPARATING MATERIAL IN RADIOACTIVE
SALT WASTE

The Energy Department chooses a process to separate
high-activity and low-activity portions of high-level
radioactive salt waste stored at the Savannah River Site in
South Carolina. The department says it will use ""caustic
side solvent extraction"" to separate highly radioactive
components of the radioactive salt waste from the
low-activity constituents. . . . Page A-6

OZONE HOLE OVER ANTARCTIC SAID NOT TO HAVE GROWN OVER PAST
THREE YEARS

The hole in the stratospheric ozone layer has not grown in
the past three years because the level of ozone-destroying
chlorine compounds has peaked and is beginning to decline,
according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. Satellite data show the area of the ozone
hole above Antarctic peaked at about 26 million square
kilometers, making it about the same size as North America
and similar to its size over the past three years. . . .

PANEL HAS LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT EXPOSURE TO METHANOL IN DIET,
AT WORK

A federal advisory panel concludes that it has ""minimal
concern"" that normal exposures to methanol through diet or
in the workplace will harm human development or
reproduction. However, the panel is more concerned over the
effects of high accidental exposures on human development.
EPA is assessing the risks of methanol to develop an
inhalation standard. . . . Page A-5

Agriculture Organization. The talks feature delegates from
102 countries meeting in dozens of small groups to ""close

U.N. PANEL REPORTS ON MAXIMUM RESIDUE LIMITS FOR 26
PESTICIDES IN FOOD

An international scientific panel recommends maximum residue
limits for 26 pesticides in food that ultimately may be used
by some countries to determine what food products are

for 2001 recommends the residue limits to the Codex
Alimentarius Committee on Pesticide Residues. . . . Page

OVERFISHING, HABITAT DAMAGE SEEN AS WORSE THAN POLLUTION FOR
OCEANS

Destruction of aquatic habitats and overfishing are having a
greater adverse impact on international waterways than is
pollution, says Dag Daler, project manager for the global
water assessment effort and a participant in a United
Nations-sponsored conference in Sweden. About 120 conferees
representing 40 countries attend the first general assembly
of the Global International Waters Assessment, a United
Nations Environment Program project. . . . Page A-9

saying the permit program has resulted in thousands of acres
of lost wetlands. . . . Page A-3

Enron taps credit line; stock slides

10/27/2001
Associated Press Newswires 
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 

HOUSTON (AP) - After Enron Corp. tapped into more than $3 billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers, stock prices dropped. 

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday. Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month.

The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value. 

Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 

""Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 

Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as ""good management decisions."" 

On Oct. 16 Enron's third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 

The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron. 

Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 

Reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 

""It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations,"" Feygin told the Houston Chronicle for Saturday's editions. 

Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 

""Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message,"" she said. ""Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management.""

BARRON'S: REVIEW & PREVIEW

10/27/2001
Capital Markets Report 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

Turning Up the Heat: 

Energy trader Enron ousted its chief financial officer days after it said the SEC was conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it made with entities tied to the CFO, Andrew S. Fastow. Enron said Fastow took a leave of absence to restore investor confidence. Enron shares have plunged 50% recently, after it announced the probe and reported a $618 million loss. 



BARRON'S: The Trader

10/27/2001

Bulls Look To Recovery, As Techs Lead The Surge 
By Andrew Barry 


-- In what undoubtedly will become a business-school case study, Enron let potentially containable concerns about some asset writedowns and a formerly obscure group of partnerships mushroom into a full-blown financial crisis last week. 

Enron's stock plunged 10.60 to 15.45, following a 10-point drop in the prior week, and the company's bonds fell sharply as yields rose to junk levels of around 10%. By week's end, Enron had drawn down $3 billion in bank credit lines to pay off nearly $2 billion in maturing commercial paper, leaving it only about $1 billion of net liquidity. 

Enron's big energy trading operation, which accounts for the bulk of the company's profits and most of its equity valuation, now may be vulnerable because it hinges on a solid credit rating and the confidence of trading counterparties. Enron faces potential debt downgrades from the major rating agencies, but the company is likely to remain an investment-grade credit. Moody's Investors Service now rates its debt Baa1, three notches above junk. 

One doomsday scenario is that counterparties on existing Enron trades, concerned about Enron's viability, push for settlement of the trades, precipitating the kind of liquidity crisis that engulfed Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. 

Despite entreaties by friendly Wall Street analysts to come clean about its financial situation, Enron has resisted, refusing to disclose the size of potential liabilities involving Enron-created partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron. 

Enron called a conference call Tuesday to clear the air, but it ended up compounding its problems by failing to answer questions posed by a Boston investor about the Marlin partnership, leaving Wall Street with the clear impression that the company faces a nearly $1 billion loss on that deal. 

Some suspect that Enron stonewalling is motivated by fears that further disclosure will expose the inadequacy of the asset coverage behind its partnerships and thus significant Enron liabilities that will impair the company's credit ratings. There may also be the need for potential writedowns of various Enron assets, including its money-losing broadband business. 

Enron now trades at only a slight premium to its second-quarter book value of $13 a share, but it's worth noting that tangible book, excluding goodwill, was only $9 a share. Book value fell in the third quarter by an undetermined about because of Enron's $1 billion asset writedown and its still-mysterious $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to one of its partnerships. The third-quarter book value won't be known until Enron releases its balance sheet, which may not occur until its quarterly 10-Q is released. 

The Enron situation is another black eye for Wall Street research. The company was a Street favorite for years because of its strong and consistent profit growth. Enron was able to get away with providing minimal disclosure about its energy trading activities and its partnerships because analysts and investors didn't demand it. The Enron bull case essentially boiled down to the company's leadership in the booming energy trading markets and analysts' confidence in management. The Street really didn't provide much more insight than that into a company that at one point had a $75 billion valuation. That value has since shrunk to $14 billion. 

Enron's woes also show how equity analysts pay too little attention to company balance sheets. Until last week, Enron analysts still were more focused on earnings dilution than the more important issue of Enron's financial health. 

Enron had about $15 billion in debt and preferred stock outstanding at the end of the second quarter and an undetermined amount of guaranteed off-balance-sheet debt. Enron clearly ignored the importance of its balance sheet, allowing it to grow enormously over the past few years. Judging from the company's rather meager credit lines, Enron apparently figured nobody would ever doubt the financial strength of the king of the energy markets.

LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunch that has left the company's credibility in ruins. 

Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held 2.8m shares until July.

Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron declined to comment on the share sales. 

Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to ""dispel uncertainty in the financial community"" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enron's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep another $800,000 in cash. He said: ""We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community."" 

The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. 

Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to restore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong. 

Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called ""failed investments"".

ENRON STOCK SINKS TO 5-YEAR LOW 

Energy trading giant Enron Corp., its stocks hammered by a potential credit crunch and its chief financial officer's ouster, fell to its lowest close in more than five years on Friday. The fall was sparked by word of a big quarterly loss and a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the ousted CFO's links to some of Enron's partnerships. Enron stock closed at $15.50, off 85 cents or 5.2 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Taps Credit Line; Stock Slides

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday after it tapped into more than $3 billion in revolving credit in an effort to re-assure investors and customers. 

Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month. The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value.

Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 

""Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 

Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as ""good management decisions."" 

Enron's most recent woes began Oct. 16 when its third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 

The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company's newer businesses such as broadband trading. 

Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 

Analysts began to demand more details behind the workings of the partnerships, details that Enron did not provide as quickly as some would have liked. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told analysts and investors the company was careful to ensure that the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected, but The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 

In drawing down the $3.3 billion line of revolving credit this week, the company put about $1.1 billion in the bank to ensure liquidity and is using the balance to begin an orderly repurchase of its commercial paper. 

Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer, and often with more flexible terms. 

Investors in commercial paper -- who are actually more like lenders, since it's actually a form of debt -- are often fund managers who often have large sums of extra cash in search of short-term investments. 

The investors like commercial paper because it lets them earn money on cash that would sit idle otherwise and lets them do it through something issued only by companies with top credit ratings and usually backed by bank lines of credit. 

""To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets, which look at it negatively,"" said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 

But reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, he said. 

""It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations,"" Feygin said. 

Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 

""Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message,"" she said. ""Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management."" 

Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned. 

In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, which would force Enron's energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it. 

""Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues,"" Dietert wrote in a report Friday. ""Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off."" 

Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store. 

For example, a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco. It was formed in 1997 with about $400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets. 

Chewco was run by Michael Kopper, a managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. 

""Frankly, that was the first time I had ever heard of that entity,"" Feygin said. ""Until now, everything that's come out I've at least heard of or had some idea of what they were from the company's filings or discussions. This is something I had never heard of before.""

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

The New York Times 
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company 

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, using $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit. 

An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.

The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents. 

The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion. 

Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper. 

Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed that its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will show a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wednesday. 

The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked questions about its accounting practices.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-interest, short-term loans. 

The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. 

""Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,"" said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. ""People are questioning the credibility of management."" 

The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 

The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%. 

Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions. 

Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ""a smart financial move,"" said Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. ""It took away the hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital.""

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading giant, continued to pay the price for financial opacity as its stock slumped to its lowest level since 1995 and its five-year bonds traded at 77 cents in the dollar with a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices at these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for bankruptcy. Page 10.

"Re: Additional lawyer.-","Emilio,

I think you should proceed.  Could you send me a resume?

Jim, our two lawyers at Azurix Buenos Aires have needed some assistance in handling routine matters, given that most of Emilio's time is taken up with the termination issues.  The though has been to hire a local lawyer, known to the local team, on a contract basis to help with these items.  There's significant work to help in dealing with pending construction and supply contracts as the concession winds down.  I assume this is OK with you.

John,
I met this lawyer that I mentioned to you again, and she seems to be
ready to manage working for us full-time during a three months period in
order to help us, mainly with the fixing of contractual issues with our
suppliers vis a vis termination / tranfer of the contracts to the
Province / determination of liabilities. The costs would not be high,
and she seems to be (I hope so) a very discreet person (particularly
considering the job she currently has). If you do not have a problem
with this (my only concern is her work at the Municipality), I would ask
her to start working for us on Monday, not on a labour relationship
basis, but rather on a independent professional one (she would bill us
for her services).

"EnTrust's Business Management Services","Dear Mr. Derrick:

I wanted to share with you the most recent product development at EnTrust
Capital.  In response to feedback from our client base, we have developed a
Business Management Services division.

Our service can encompass many aspects of your daily life; check writing,
banking, bookkeeping, monthly reporting of expenditures, budgeting, payroll
services for household employees, analysis, reconciliation and recording of
brokerage activity, to name a few, and the cost for these services is
relatively negligible.  We will provide practical guidance on cash
management and investment of surplus funds in order to maximize interest
earned on excess cash balances.  We are also able to coordinate and interact
closely with your tax accountants (or recommend ones, if necessary) to help
plan for your income taxes and to make the preparation of your personal
income tax returns as painless as possible.

Our business management group consists of a small, but growing professional
staff, including a bookkeeper, certified public accountant and tax,
insurance and business consultants, all of whom are highly trained and
experienced in all facets of personal business management.  Their focus is
solely that of organizing and servicing our clients' daily business
management needs. Our insurance consultants can review, broker or underwrite
any of your insurance needs.  Furthermore, having a trusted ""gatekeeper"" to
coordinate and interact with all your professional advisors can help insure
that nothing gets overlooked.

Additionally, EnTrust has developed close working relationships with
attorneys and accountants specializing in trusts and estates, with whom we
can coordinate your estate planning in conjunction with your overall
investment objectives.  Furthermore, we offer brokerage account recording,
reconciliation, analysis and record keeping for your trusts and estates.

With EnTrust's business management group, not only can we help save you
time, headaches and simplify your daily life, but we can turn an oftentimes
disorganized ""do-it-yourself"" chore into a professional, systemized personal
business management success, at a low cost to you.  We view this newest
service as part of our overall and continuing goal of understanding and
meeting our clients' needs.

Please feel free to contact me at (212) 224-5503, or via email
tlevy@entrustcapital.com to arrange for a meeting or conference call to
evaluate how our Business Management Services may be able to help you manage
your personal finances more efficiently.

Regards,

Todd

"FW: Third Quarter Earnings Results","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of Office of the Chairman-@ENRON
Sent:	Tuesday, October 16, 2001 9:26 AM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Third Quarter Earnings Results


Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Dear All,

With reference to Art 14.2 (11) of the Articles of Association the Management Board wishes to ask the Supervisory Board for written consent to assign the rights of ownership of motor vehicle Alfa Romeo (reg - RLE 400) to the insurers PZU to enable them to pay compensation to ENS for the theft of the vehicle.

STATES GAIN FLEXIBILITY IN ADOPTING NUTRIENT CRITERIA FOR
WATER STANDARDS

States may be allowed some flexibility to meet a 2004
deadline for adopting nutrient criteria into water quality
standards if they can demonstrate a plan for meeting
specific milestones, EPA writes in final guidance on the
criteria. In addition, the guidance allows states to
prioritize the waters for which they need to develop
nutrient criteria and to use their own approach in the
process. Excessive nutrients lead to eutrophication, which
manifests itself as algal blooms. EPA says these blooms
result in low dissolved oxygen levels, fish kills, murky
water, and depletion of aquatic flora and fauna. . . . Page

CARBON MONOXIDE LIMITS RELAXED FOR LARGE MUNICIPAL WASTE
COMBUSTORS

EPA announces that it is extending from three hours to 15
hours the period, during two types of malfunctions, when
large municipal waste combustors are excused from compliance
with carbon monoxide emissions limits. The rule amends the
new source performance standards for large municipal waste
combustors issued in 1995, which required compliance with
emissions limits except during three-hour periods of
startup, shutdown, or malfunction. . . . Page A-1

HOUSE PANEL PROPOSES FUNDS TO ASSESS VULNERABILITY OF WATER
SUPPLY

A $20 billion anti-terrorism package proposed by the House
Appropriations Committee includes nearly $110 million, an
amount not requested by the White House, for immediate
drinking water vulnerability assessments by EPA.  The funds
would pay for both cyber and physical security assessments
that could begin as early as this year if the overall
spending bill is approved by Congress. . . . Page A-1

REPROCESSED URANIUM TO BE USED AS FUEL AT TVA POWER PLANT IN
ALABAMA

The Tennessee Valley Authority will enter an agreement with
the Energy Department to reprocess about 33 metric tons of
highly enriched uranium for use as fuel in an
electricity-generating power plant. Bruce L. Yeager, an
environmental policy specialist with TVA, says the
weapons-grade uranium will be converted to low-enriched
uranium for use at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in Athens,
Ala. . . . Page A-3

TWO SUPERFUND SITES IN PENNSYLVANIA DELETED FROM NATIONAL
PRIORITIES LIST

Two Pennsylvania superfund sites--the Aladdin Plating site
near Scranton and a portion of the Tobyhanna Army Depot Site
in Monroe County--are deleted from the National Priorities
List by EPA. . . . Page A-2

 GUIDANCE ON RISK ASSESSMENT FOR PESTICIDES EXPECTED IN
DECEMBER

Revised guidance explaining how the EPA is assessing
cumulative risks of the organophosphate pesticides will soon
be reviewed by the White House Office of Management and
Budget and is expected to be approved for release by early
December. This cumulative methodology guidance will coincide
with the expected Dec. 3 release of a preliminary cumulative
risk assessment of the organophosphates, says an advisor in
the Office of Pesticide Programs. . . . Page A-9

EPA CHARACTERIZES RECYCLING INDUSTRY AS MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO
ECONOMY

The U.S. recycling industry is a viable, well-established
business sector that is diverse and contributes
significantly to the economy, according to an EPA study.
EPA finds more than 56,000 recycling and reuse
establishments operating nationwide with annual gross
revenue of over $236 billion. . . . Page A-2

MINNESOTA TO RELAX PERMIT PROCESS FOR SOLID WASTE TRANSFER
FACILITIES

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency announces plans to
streamline the permitting process for solid waste transfer
facilities. The agency also plans to establish a new
classification system for demolition debris and industrial
solid waste land disposal facilities to better define where
certain waste should be taken. . . . Page A-7

COLORADO CLARIFIES REQUIREMENTS FOR INTEGRATED PUBLIC WATER
SYSTEMS

The Colorado Board of Health clarifies requirements for
integrated public water systems. An integrated system
involves two or more public water systems--one of which is
the supply system--which have physically connected
distribution systems and which agree to operate using a
common set of standards. . . . Page A-7

FRANCE ANNOUNCES IMMEDIATE BAN ON USE OF ARSENIC SALT IN
AGRICULTURE

The French Ministry of Agriculture announces an immediate
ban on the use of arsenic salts (sodium arsenates) in
agriculture. French winemakers use about 1.5 million liters
of arsenic salts annually to prevent the spread of fungus in
vineyards. The ministry points to a report on the
carcinogenic properties of arsenic salts. . . . Page A-6

WORLD BANK URGES CHINA TO INCREASE SPENDING ON ENVIRONMENT

China needs to increase its investment in environmental
protection by one-third, says a World Bank report. World
Bank Vice President Jemal-ud-din Kassum says when releasing
the report that environmental protection is ""growing in
importance"" within the bank's operations in China. . . .

EUROPEAN UNION
______________

CHEMICAL LABELING : The European Parliament endorses a more
stringent approach to regulating industrial chemicals that
would require chemical manufacturers to provide toxicity
data on their products before selling them, would mandate
labeling of products that contain hazardous substances, and
establish the public's right-to-know the results of toxicity
tests and whether those tests were conducted on animals.  .
. . Page A-4

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y5h2d0_

CLIMATE CHANGE: A European Union emissions trading scheme
should be voluntary in its initial phase and should include
all six of the greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto
Protocol instead of just carbon dioxide, says the Union of
the Electricity Industry, a trade association representing
producers of electricity in the EU. . . . Page A-4

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y5b2r1_

CARBON SINKS: Despite arguing for years against the use of
""carbon sinks"" to offset greenhouse gas emissions, the
European Commission announces a method to verify the amount
of greenhouse gases taken up by forests that will play a
""fundamental role"" in implementing the Kyoto Protocol. . . .

Dear Senator Leahy:

        I am Chairman of the Committee of Corporate General Counsel, which is part of the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association. Our membership is comprised of the senior-most legal officers of many of America's largest companies.

        Our members have asked me to write to you, in your capacity as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to express our views concerning the importance of the Federal Judiciary.

        The tragic events of September 11 underscore for all of us the freedoms that we enjoy in our country. We know that you and your fellow Senators on the Judiciary Committee are devoted to helping protect these precious freedoms. We also know that you and your fellow Senators recognize the critical importance of our system of justice in preserving and protecting these freedoms.

        We write to express our thanks to you and your colleagues for your efforts in reviewing the qualifications of individuals nominated for Federal District Court and Circuit Court positions. Recognizing the need for a fully-staffed Federal Judiciary, we also appreciate all your efforts in determining the qualifications of nominees for the Judiciary as expeditiously as possible.

         If our organization, or any of our members, may ever be of assistance in any way, I hope you will call upon us. Thank you.

Subject:	Erroneous press

Mark, I'm sure you are aware of the comments in the press that I have copied and inserted here below.  There have been others that are similar.  Basically, the press is reporting that we have dissolved the LJM partnerships, ended all relationships with the LJM entities, etc.  All that we have done is unwind the raptor entities, LJM still exists, all other transactions with LJM still exist, it's just that Andy sold his interest in the partnerships.  Michael Kopper owns them and would probably be considered a ""friend of Enron"" by investors/journalists.

I'm concerned about our efforts to build back investor confidence - do we correct the press?  how do we address this?  I'm concerned that we will once again be hit with credibility concerns when the press or investors fully understand that LJM still exists and we have deals still pending with it and have deals still in place with it.  How do we correct this erroneous press?   Sherron Watkins

   RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

   Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have
determined
   to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date.
I
   hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have
already
   made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

   Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
   date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
   <mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of
your
   availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
   originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
   followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

   a) ____________

   b) ____________

   c) ____________

   d) ____________

   After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting
for
   the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members
and
   notify you of the new date.

   Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that
we
   have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
   I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.

Subject:	In re F&J Representation
Importance:	High



	I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:

	1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.

	2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.

	3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.

	4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:

	a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the ""Method and System for the Determination of VAR"").

	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.

	c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.

	Proposed going forward strategy:

	Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.

	Britt

HIGHLIGHTS

NINTH CIRCUIT USES EIGHTH AMENDMENT PROPORTIONALITY TEST TO
VOID NONCAPITAL SENTENCE IMPOSED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S THREE
STRIKES LAW

Prison terms, imposed under California's ""Three Strikes""
law, that will ensure at least 50 years of incarceration for
a nonviolent recidivist convicted of petty theft violate the
Eighth Amendment, the Ninth Circuit declares. The court
finds the sentence grossly disproportionate to the gravity
of the defendant's property crimes and to comparable
sentences in other jurisdictions.

The Three Strikes law imposes a minimum 25-year sentence
without parole for any third felony offense by a defendant
with at least two prior convictions for ""serious"" or
""violent"" felonies. The court cites several problems with
the statute, including that the triggering felony need not
be serious or violent, the prior strikes need not be violent
offenses, and there is no time period after which prior
convictions will no longer be counted as strikes. . . . Page

FRAUD ON COURT, AS OPPOSED TO FRAUD ON PTO, MAY NOT SERVE AS
GROUND FOR HOLDING PATENT UNENFORCEABLE, FEDERAL CIRCUIT
SAYS

Litigation misconduct by a patentee may be the basis for
dismissing a particular patent infringement suit but not for
finding the patent unenforceable, the Federal Circuit holds.
""Litigation misconduct, while serving as a basis to dismiss
the wrongful litigant, does not infect, or even affect, the
original grant of the property right,"" the court reasons.

The court distinguishes fraud on the court from inequitable
conduct before the Patent and Trademark Office in obtaining
the patent, which taints the patent itself and renders it
unenforceable by any party. The court disavows broad dicta
in a 1990 decision indicating that patents may be held
""unenforceable due to unclean hands."" . . . Page 1298

PUNITIVE DAMAGES MEGA-AWARD IN EXXON VALDEZ CASE REVERSED BY
NINTH CIRCUIT AS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY EXCESSIVE

The $5 billion punitive damages award to commercial
fishermen injured by the ""Exxon Valdez"" oil spill is
unconstitutionally excessive, the Ninth Circuit rules. The
award is disproportionate to the $287 million compensatory
damages incurred by the plaintiffs, to potential criminal
and civil penalties, and to the $125 million restitution and
penalty settlement with federal and state authorities, the
court finds.

The unprecedented 1995 award was entered before the U.S.
Supreme Court spelled out the due process constraints on the
magnitude of punitive damages in ""BMW v. Gore"". Applying the
""Gore"" standards, the Ninth Circuit concludes that the
district court did not properly take into account the purely
economic nature of the harm incurred by the plaintiffs, the
unintentional character of the accident, or the mitigating
actions undertaken by Exxon. . . . Page 1301

Photo Sessions for Next Pictorial Roster Set for June 19-20, August 14-15

	The Houston Bar Association has contracted with a new publisher for
the 2002 edition of the HBA Pictorial Roster, and photography sessions have
been scheduled for members who would like to have a new picture taken for
the Roster -- free of charge.
	Any member who would like to have his or her photo taken may come by
the Houston Bar Association office between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. on June 19 or June 20. Another session will be scheduled August 14 and
August 15. There is no charge for the photo, no appointment is necessary,
and the photo sessions will take only a few minutes. The Houston Bar
Association office is located downtown at 1001 Fannin, Suite 1300.
	Members may also submit their own photo for the Roster, or use an
existing photo already on file with the HBA.
	Legal Directories Publishing Company, Inc. will begin publishing
annual editions of the Pictorial Roster, rather than every two years. The
HBA hopes to have as many current photos as possible in the new Roster, so
please take advantage of this opportunity.

"Institute for Law and Technology ExComm Meeting on Nov. 2","Hi Jim,

I got your phone message and fully understand your need to be in Houston
next Friday.

We will of course reschedule the Executive Committee meeting from
November 2 to a later date.  The good news is that this will give us a
chance to pick a date far enough out to attract a better attendance.

Are there dates in December which you are confident will be available on
your schedule for the re-scheduled meeting?  I recommend that we follow
Anne McNamara's suggestion and float those dates now -- 5 to 7 weeks out
-- and pick the date most convenient to most members.

Shall I draft an e-memo from you stating that we want to re-schedule the
meeting to accommodate more members' schedules, and proposing dates for
them to tell us their availability?

Good luck with all the crocodiles and turkeys you're having to deal with
these days.

David

"RE: Resolution No 9","Jarek

We were having some retention problems with Jacek for a variety of reasons.  After discussion in London we decided to increase his package.

I believe it is highly unlikely that Jacek would be interested in working out of the Warsaw office for Enron Poland.

The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.

Jim:  Im finalizing the SPA that will be going out to our shortlist of
final-round bidders in connection with the auction of our interest in
SK-Enron.  Currently, the definition of ""Knowledge"" as it relates to our
knowledge-qualified reps only includes the actual knowkedge of Jim Hughes
and Darrell Kinder.  For optical reasons, our bankers and corp. development
have suggested we broaden that group to include at least the actual
knowledge of the Enron-appointed directors of SK-Enron, which, of course,
would include you.  Although I realize you have not been intimately
involved with the goings-on at SK-Enron, Im checking if it would be ok with
you to be added to the list for the desired optics. Im happy to provide you
with the draft agreement (and the schedules once they are prepared) should
you desire.  Pls let me know.  Thanks.

"ENS Audit 2001","I understand that due to Enron's problems in America and the fact that that Arthur Andersen are getting involved in a dispute over various audit matters as a result of the bankruptcy there may be difficulties in having Andersen audit ENS for year 2001. While I can see that there may be reservations in accepting the re-appointment of Andersen for ENS I feel that we should consider the implications of finding another auditor at this late stage.

Andersen in Warsaw are well aware of the problems ENS is facing at the present time with regard to power and gas pricing; they are aware of the problems associated with the Settlement Agreement and it's accounting treatment to date. They are familiar with our systems and people. We have also negotiated a significant reduction in fees compared with last year.

New auditors would have to be taken through all the issues from scratch. This would consume time not only from the accounting department but throughout the Company. The audit would take longer and, at this stage, I'm not sure when any new auditors would be able to start given that January is their busiest period. Andersen are available with immediate effect since I have constantly been impressing on them that, given the complexity of ENS problems, we should allow ourselves the maximum amount of time to consider what to put into the report should some problems persist longer than envisaged.

I feel that a change in auditors at this moment in time would be not be in our best interests in view of the above. Also if the ownership of ENS is to be changed it would be beneficial to have audited accounts in double quick time since potential investors will undoubtedly be looking for such statements.

Michelle and Kriste: 
You probably know about this case already, but this was filed this week in Federal Court: 
Pamela Tittle et al. v. Enron Corp. et al. 
11/13/2001-3913 
The description of the facts are: 
Possible class action ERISA violation case in which the defendants failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties to an Enron employee retirement plan by misrepresenting the financial status of hedging agreements made with third party partnerships.
The plaintiff's attorney is Robin Harrison.  I know Robin quite well.  He does not do that much employment work, and is more of a commercial litigator.  As you know, I have done a substantial amount of ERISA work and would be interested in helping Enron out on this case.  Please let me know what we can do to help.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Today, the Corporate Secretary Department began receiving large amounts of registered mail which already has been signed for in the mailroom and delivered to us.  Chuck Cheek tells us that his Litigation Group should not receive these letters and will not be directly involved. 

We are just trying to ascertain to whom (individual/department/outside counsel) should this mail be directed.  

When we get an answer, we will pass the word and give the mailroom proper instructions.  It is my understanding that many of the officers on 50 also are receiving these letters.  We will need to notify all of the proper procedure.  

Let me know, and we'll take it from there.

PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERS FOR AIRPORT  SECURITY
There is overwhelming evidence that highly  professional public-
private partnerships work in high-threat European  countries, says 
Kenneth P. Quinn, former chief counsel to the Federal  Aviation 
Administration.
The European system compares favorably to the  unfunded mandate to 
provide security at airports that is put on American  airlines, 
says Quinn:
o There, the screening workforce is about 15 percent  public 
and 85 percent private, and wages are often 60  percent 
higher -- here, wages are too low.
o There, turnover is around 15 percent; here, it  often 
exceeds 100 percent.
o There, national governments impose strict training,  with 
36 hours' classroom time and up to 200 hours' airport  
training -- here, we require 12 hours' classroom and  only 
40 hours' on-the-job training.
There, proof of European Union member-state  citizenship is often 
required of workers. Here, resident-alien status  suffices. 
There, federal governments license the companies and  their 
workers. Here, all security responsibilities fall on  carriers, 
with no federal certification.
Disparaging and certainly nationalizing the private  workforce at 
U.S. airports -- which by all accounts performed  properly on 
Sept. 11 -- will cause the current system of contract  workers to 
break down, as workers look for new jobs or transfer  to more 
secure ones.
President Bush has asked Congress not to tie his  hands by 
preventing him from turning to the private sector,  saying: 
""Giving the government flexibility to use private  contractors 
will facilitate transition to the new system, promote  better 
screening services through competition, and ensure  that security 
managers can move swiftly to discipline or remove  employees who 
fail to live up to the rigorous new  standards.""

"RE: BAKER & McKENZIE","
Jim,

B&M are our lead firm in Japan, and are used extensively by Jane McBride, and also on a more sporadic basis by businesses in London (eg metals and the Wind business) which have operations in Japan. Enron Wind in Japan have appointed Paul Davies of B&M in Tokyo to act on a joint venture for Enron Wind in Japan.

In the summer of 2000, we undertook some basic physical gas due diligence re gas in the Ukraine utilising Baker & McKenzie's Kiev office.  This was in preparation for a potential long-term gas deal to get gas out of the Ukraine to the Romanian border (for onward sale in Romania / Poland).  B&M was the only ""recognised"" firm in the Ukraine.

That's it.

We hope you are now in receipt of preliminary results from Ipsos-Reid's Public Perceptions on Continental Energy as reported in the prestigious National Journal sent on Friday.  As well, we have included a hyperlink to our  November 17th 2001 presentation to the Senate Leadership entitled Public Opinion on Energy Issues and National Energy Policy and the press release resulting from that day's press conference.  Your organization might really benefit from seeing the whole survey, which will be completed shortly after Thanksgiving. This survey is the largest poll ever conducted on public opinion about energy issues in North America. To discuss this further, please contact me, Thomas Riehle, President of Ipsos-Reid U.S. Public Affairs at (202) 463-7300.

I look forward to reviewing this opportunity with you and your organization.

Subject:	L. Nagyte's resume



Dear Mr. Emilio Battioli,

I am an LL.M. candidate (August 2001) at the University of Michigan Law
School. I am very happy to have found the attorney in Enron Corporation who
has studied at the University of Warwick, the institution from which I have
graduated, too.

I have always been eager to practise law in a corporation and at the moment
I am looking for a job in the South of the US. Therefore, I have decided to
write to you contemplating that Enron Corporation may be interested in
utilizing my credentials.

As a native of Lithuania with a law and business degree from the University
of Warwick, I have had extensive international business and personal
experience in UK, Eastern Europe and Russia. I did an internship in Oil
Trading International and Legal Departments of BP Amoco PLC, London. I also
gained some corporate work experience when doing an internship in Harden &
Wells in Beijing. To gain further insight into corporate and securities
matters, I have focused on business related classes at the University of
Michigan Law School.

I would really appreciate if you had a look at my resume, which is attached
to this e-mail. Thank you ever so much.

Sincerely,
Lina Nagyte

"Dabhol -- A Brief Legal Update","Gentlemen -

A few brief updates:

The hearing before the Bombay High Court regarding MERC jurisdiction is still on for Monday.  We are still not sure whether or not there will be anything substantive discussed at the hearing.  Gail Brownfeld and Christopher Walker are flying to Bombay just in case.  I just spoke with Jim McCartney and he is planning to try to attend as well.  

There was no unified ""message"" from the lenders at the conclusion of the Singapore lenders meetings.  Our Finance guys are pretty confident that the offshore lenders will not cure the construction contract defaults this month.  The Indian banks may or may not cure.  If no one cures, the construction contracts will terminate in mid-June. 

We received a copy of a very interesting letter from the Chairman of MSEB to the India Central Electricity Authority and copied to GOM dated January 11, 2001 (less than three weeks before we were first accused of misdeclaring).  The Chairman states:  

""The high price of Dabhol power today was perhaps not accurately anticipated. . . .DPC Phase II trial runs are to commence shortly. . . .It is a fact that we have not been able to fully absorb even DPC phase I power at 90% PLF. . . .[O]nly on MSEB projections and certification DPC have invested a huge sum in Phase II.  Can we ask them to stop now?  Poor off-takes of DPC power are not just because of low demand, but also on account of the high price and the poor financial condition of MSEB.  We would be grateful for Government advice in the matter.""

It appears to me that the ""advice"" was to charge that DPC was misdeclaring its availability and to demand huge offsets as a result.

Bruce

EPA ISSUES RULE TO PROTECT DRINKING WATER FROM MICROBIAL
CONTAMINATION

EPA Administrator Whitman signs a final rule requiring
drinking water systems to install controls preventing the
backwash of recycled water from filter rinsing. The rule is
designed to prevent microbial contamination of drinking
water. Issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments
of 1996, the Filter Backwash Recycling Rule will apply to
more than 4,600 large and small water systems that serve
about 35 million Americans, according to EPA.  ""Today, I am
taking steps to better protect America's drinking water from
microbial contaminants, such as Cryptosporidium,"" Whitman
says. . . . Page AA-1

BUSH PLEDGES TO UPHOLD MORATORIUM ON OIL DRILLING OFF
CALIFORNIA COAST

President Bush says he will continue a moratorium on new
leases for oil and gas drilling off the California coast.
""Mr. Governor, I will honor my commitment to you to uphold
the moratorium on new drilling leases off the coast of
California,"" Bush says in Los Angeles. Former President Bush
imposed a moratorium on drilling in offshore areas of
California in 1990, and President Clinton extended the
moratorium until June 2012. . . . Page A-2

WHITMAN REVIEWING PROPOSAL TO CUT PAPERWORK BURDEN OF WASTE
RULES

EPA Administrator Whitman is said to be reviewing a proposed
rule to reduce the paperwork burden imposed by hazardous
waste regulations. Examples of the changes in the proposal
are the reduction of hazardous waste tank inspections and
the elimination of certain notices under the Land Disposal
Restriction rules. A final rule is not expected until late
next year. . . . Page A-1

FATHER, SON SENTENCED TO PRISON IN CFC DISTRIBUTION CASE IN
FLORIDA

A federal judge in West Palm Beach, Fla., sentences to
prison a father and son who pleaded guilty to conspiracy
charges to distribute dichlorodifluoromethane gas (CFC-12)
and to evade some $7 million in federal excise tax on the
ozone-depleting refrigerant. Aurelio Vigna is sentenced to
24 months in prison and his son, Joseph Vigna, to 18 months
in prison. The judge also orders them to pay a combined
$750,000 to the IRS and to resolve all civil tax liability.

PAINT COMPANIES TO PAY $800,000 FOR CLEANUP OF BALTIMORE
SUPERFUND SITE

Four paint companies agree in a proposed settlement to pay
$800,000 to EPA for the costs of cleaning up a former
industrial superfund site in Baltimore. Under the proposed
settlement in federal court, Jotun A/S and Jotun Marine
Coatings Inc. will pay EPA nearly $200,000, and Ameron
International Corp. and the Valspar Corp. will pay a total
of $600,000 to reimburse the agency for removal activities
performed on the Ainsworth Paint & Chemical Co. superfund
site in Baltimore. . . . Page A-3

U.S. INDUSTRY DERAILS APPROVAL OF INTERNATIONAL SYMBOL FOR
CHEMICAL RISK

The International Labor Organization's Working Group on the
Harmonization of Chemical Hazard Communication fails to
agree on a proposed international sign for identifying
chemical hazards after objections are raised by the U.S. air
transport industry. The industry objects to the use of the
sign to indicate immediate as well as long-term hazards. The
harmonized system is meant to improve worker safety
standards and consumer protection around the world in the
labeling and transport of chemical goods. . . . Page A-5

GAO SEEKS CRITERIA FOR MEASURING SUCCESS OF EFFORTS TO
PROTECT WETLANDS

Criteria should be established for measuring the ecological
success of wetlands mitigation efforts to ensure in-lieu fee
arrangements and other means of mitigating wetland losses
accomplish their goals, the General Accounting Office says.
In-lieu fee mitigation occurs when a permittee pays a fee
instead of performing mitigation associated with a project
or buying credits from a mitigation bank--parcels of land
set aside and restored, usually as high-quality wetlands.
""The extent to which the in-lieu-fee option has achieved its
purpose of mitigating adverse impacts to wetlands is
uncertain,"" GAO said. . . . Page A-2

HOUSE BILL WOULD REQUIRE STUDY ON REDUCING NUMBER OF
GASOLINE BLENDS

Two Wisconsin congressmen offer legislation (H.R. 2017) to
require an EPA study on the feasibility of reducing the
number of gasoline blends sold in the Midwest and other
parts of the country. The representatives say they want the
EPA to determine whether more uniformity among gasoline
blends would ease supply problems and bring down prices. . .

NORTH CAROLINA EXPECTED TO FALL SHORT OF SOLID WASTE
REDUCTION GOAL

The amount of solid waste disposed of in North Carolina has
dramatically increased over the past 10 years, making the
state's waste disposal reduction goals impossible to meet,
according to the state Department of Environment and Natural
Resources. The department's latest solid waste management
annual report says the amount of solid waste disposed of by
North Carolina residents has increased by 45 percent since
1991. . . . Page A-6

ICELAND EXPECTS TO RECEIVE EXEMPTION UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE
TREATY

An exemption to allow Iceland to build a new industrial
facility without violating the Kyoto Protocol's limits on
greenhouse gases probably will be approved by the climate
change pact's signatories, perhaps as early as July.
Iceland's environment minister, Siv Fridleifsdo`ttir, says
the exemption would acknowledge that one additional factory
in Iceland could lead to a large percentage increase in the
nation's greenhouse gas emissions. The clause is scheduled
to be discussed at the climate change talks in Bonn in July.

U.S.-CANADA: A science advisory panel is expected to meet in
June to review nontarget plant toxicity tests being
harmonized under NAFTA by EPA and Canada's Pest Management
Regulatory Agency. The review by the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel is
a step toward harmonizing U.S. and Canadian data
requirements on the toxicity of pesticides to plants not
targeted by the chemicals.

An EPA official says the review could assist the two
agencies in conducting plant risk assessments and in
reducing uncertainty in risk management decisions.

Under NAFTA, Canada and the United States agree to develop
compatible pesticide review programs to facilitate routine
sharing of work. . . . Page A-6

REGISTRATION: A recent arbitration decision on how one
pesticide maker should compensate another for data generated
to support regulatory decisions may lead to the use of a
hybrid method of data citation, an attorney involved in the
dispute tells BNA. Pesticide makers may try to combine the
methods of data citation known as selective citation and
cite-all citation, according to the attorney who represented
Gharda U.S.A. in the arbitration involving the pesticide
chlorpyrifos. . . . Page A-5

Jim,

B&M are our lead firm in Japan, and are used extensively by Jane McBride, and also on a more sporadic basis by businesses in London (eg metals and the Wind business) which have operations in Japan. Enron Wind in Japan have appointed Paul Davies of B&M in Tokyo to act on a joint venture for Enron Wind in Japan.

In the summer of 2000, we undertook some basic physical gas due diligence re gas in the Ukraine utilising Baker & McKenzie's Kiev office.  This was in preparation for a potential long-term gas deal to get gas out of the Ukraine to the Romanian border (for onward sale in Romania / Poland).  B&M was the only ""recognised"" firm in the Ukraine.

That's it.

"Sunday's meetings","
Hardie Davis and I plan to join Sunday's Audit Comm. and BoD meeting by phone.  Will you be here physically or via phone?  I am just looking for a human being from the Company who might be here in case other humans decide to come to the building as well!   We have reserved 50M03 for people attending in person.

Laura Valencia and Mary Martinez will be here for any administrative needs, and Laura will start the call and be on the communications line.  I will have a second line and be able to communicate directly with her if necessary.

I do not yet know if Ken plans to be in the building or not.  Please drop me a note with your plans.  

Rick - Do you have a preference for the AA guys?  Also, have you considered an executive session at the start or at the end of the call for any matters the Audit Comm. might want to address in that forum?  We could keep the third-party folks on ""music hold"" if you choose to have an exec. session.

Jim - I am trying to be out of the office next Mon. - Wed..  Hardie will be here and I will be very accessible.  Let me know if you have any concerns about that, but I think I can manage the activities from afar for a few days.  

Thank you.

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.

We have heard from many of you regarding the attached request.  This e-mail lets you know suggested recipients to date.  It also confirms that (i) the current goal is to ascertain whether a change of ownership of either Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp. will cause contract breaches, defaults or terminations resulting in material liabilities and (ii) the timetable is as soon as possible.  Preliminary responses early this week (subject to further review as necessary) would be most helpful.

Thanks again, NJD

To clarify, consider contracts to which Enron Corp., Enron North America Corp. or their subsidiaries are parties that contain provisions concerning a change of ownership/control of Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp.  At this point, we are considering material contracts, or a group of similar or standard contracts that collectively are material, or contracts the breach of which could result in material liability.

Nations Special Commission. He edited Toxic Terror:  Assessing Terrorist
Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons and wrote Scourge: The Once and

Subject:	Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation


As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"In re F&J Representation","

	I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:

	1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.

	2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.

	3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.

	4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:

	a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the ""Method and System for the Determination of VAR"").

	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.

	c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.

	Proposed going forward strategy:

	Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.

	Britt

 Dear Bob

It was good to speak to you briefly when I was in Houston the week before
last and I am sorry we did not get the chance to meet up. As I mentioned I
have very much enjoyed working with all of the team at Enron on the ICI job
and hope that at some stage in the future we get a chance to work together
again.

There was one matter that I forgot to mention when we spoke, although
Michael Brown may already have mentioned it to you. A few weeks ago we were
asked to act for the Maharashta State Electricity Board in relation to
arbitration proceedings against Dabhol. We of course turned the job down as
we obviously did not want to act against Enron(or of course Gail) given our
existing relationship. You would of course expect nothing less but I hope
you might bear this in mind next time you have a major dispute for which you
need UK counsel. After we turned down the job I think the MSEB's next port
of call was going to be Herbert Smith, our opponents on the ICI job!

I am due to see Gail in London next week but if you are ever passing through
London I do hope you will also look me up.

With best regards

Richard

Dear Senator Leahy:

        I am Chairman of the Committee of Corporate General Counsel, which
is part of the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association. Our
membership is comprised of the senior-most legal officers of many of
America's largest companies.

        Our members have asked me to write to you, in your capacity as
Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to express our views concerning
the importance of the Federal Judiciary.

        The tragic events of September 11 underscore for all of us the
freedoms that we enjoy in our country. We know that you and your fellow
Senators on the Judiciary Committee are devoted to helping protect these
precious freedoms. We also know that you and your fellow Senators recognize
the critical importance of our system of justice in preserving and
protecting these freedoms.

        We write to express our thanks to you and your colleagues for your
efforts in reviewing the qualifications of individuals nominated for Federal
District Court and Circuit Court positions. Recognizing the need for a
fully-staffed Federal Judiciary, we also appreciate all your efforts in
determining the qualifications of nominees for the Judiciary as
expeditiously as possible.

         If our organization, or any of our members, may ever be of
assistance in any way, I hope you will call upon us. Thank you.

"Re: Society for the Performing Arts Draft Cover Letter for Lyons Foundation","Thank you, Jim!  We need all the extra edge we can get in this tricky
fundraising climate.

Joyce Gillespie with The Lyons Foundation asked me to provide her a copy of
any letter that we send to the trustees.  Please adapt this letter to your
style and send to each of them w/carbon to:
Joyce Gillespie
The Lyons Foundation
1202 Dairy Ashford
Houston, Texas 77079-3004

Dear Jim/R.A. Seale,
I've been a member of Society for the Performing Arts for a number of years
and have enjoyed every minute.  The organization was founded in 1966 along
with the establishment of Jones Hall (construction began in 1964 under John
Jones/Houston Endowment leadership) and represents some of the finest
performers, dancers, musicians in the world.

We are appealing more broadly to our local foundations and need your help to
allow them to continue their fine outreach program.  As you can imagine, the
flooding of Jones Hall in June virtually devastated their offices and their
archives, but their outreach and education programs have continued due to
the staff's dedication to the arts.  They even managed to hang onto Mormon
Tabernacle Choir when Jones Hall was flooded by moving them over to Reliant
Hall.

Our city needs as much relief and beauty as we can muster in these difficult
times.  Thank you for strongly favoring this request.  Call Sally Tyler,
Director of Development, at 713-227-3384, if you need additional
information.

"RE: Status of EWS Litigation","Jim:  Thanks for forwarding this to me---this helps me with our ongoing (seemingly daily!) disclosure issues.  Considering the confidential nature of these litigation memos, and the fact that Andy probably doesn't know who the heck I am(and probably doesn't care!), would you ask him to include me on his distribution list?  I think he will be more comfortable getting the request from you.  Thanks, Rex.

When Is A Software Invention Actually Ready For Patenting?    The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently affirmed  a District Court decision of patent invalidity under the on-sale  provisions of 35 U.S.C. ?102(b). Robotic Vision Sys.,  Inc. v. View Eng'g, Inc and General Scanning, Inc., 249 F.3d  1307 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Federal Circuit applied the new two  prong on-sale bar test from Wayne K. Pfaff v. Wells Elecs.,  Inc., 525 U.S. 55 (1998).    In the Pfaff case, the Supreme Court, referred to drawings  and other descriptions of an invention as proof that the invention  is complete and hence ready for patenting. Using the new Pfaff  test, the Federal Circuit held in the Robotic Vision case that a software invention was ready  for patenting when one of the inventors verbally described the invention  to a co-worker in sufficient detail to allow him to practice it,  even though the actual software used to practice the invention  did not exist before the on-sale bar date.    The Robotic Vision case helps illustrate the dynamic nature  of patent law used to protect high-tech inventions. It also illustrates  the caution that must be exercised when attempting to protect  high-tech inventions including methods that are implemented with  software. The conduct of inventors as well as marketing or sales  materials that could describe details of software inventions must  now receive more scrutiny to avoid inadvertent on-sale bars under  ?102(b).

Subject:	Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation


As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Dear Stephen, 
I naturally follow with interest the Enron discussions in India. We do have  
reasonably good relations in the energy policy field in India, and I in  
particular with the Indian energy regulator. 
We do offer a deal mediation/conciliation service. My sentiment is that your  
negotiations in India have reached locked position, out of which it is  
normally almost impossible to extricate. 
You might consider or put me in touch with the senior Enron staff to see if  
they would be interested in a conciliation/deal mediation project.

Subject: Summer Intern Program




I am a member of the  Houston Bar Association -- Minority Opportunities in the Legal Profession  Committee.  One of the programs we sponsor is a first-year law student  internship program.   This committee meets with the students at all of  the law schools in Houston and asks them to submit their resumes.  We then  provide copies of the resumes to prospective employers for review.  The  employer then selects the students they would like to interview.   

 

Some employers have  the students participate in their permanent hiring programs.  Others  provide this simply as a learning experience for the students.  The  employer determines the length of the internship and the compensation.  Six  weeks is a common period.  This is a great program which has provided  valuable experience to a large number of students for many years.  If your  organization would be interested in participating in this program, or if you  would like more information, please e-mail me or call me.  I appreciate  your consideration of this matter.   (Please feel free to forward this  e-mail to the appropriate person(s) in your organization.)

executive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour,
saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this
deal, and  <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002702.html> others,
have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collapsed, falling 54%
in just seven days.

Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that
once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of
once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that
scale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says
Fastow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon,
formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.


How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's
alleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to
show that the ""Fastow era"" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing
anonymous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon
complained about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear
was that Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was
allegedly making a lot of money from LJM2.


Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for
Enron. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's
account of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.



Plunging
Investors not liking Enron here

  <http://images.thestreet.com/markets/detox/1425.gif>

Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it took
massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a
difficult  <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002864.html> conference
call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding backing. It took
Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In other words, Lay
listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much further does the
stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at the company?

The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and
Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was
necessary to rebuild investor confidence.


Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one
shadowy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading
business makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in
isolation and without the knowledge of the board.


In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and Skilling proposed the LJM2
transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband
business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come from
being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge that
volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it access to
increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from the
downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman
responds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it
had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.


Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views.
Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent
on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad
has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an
unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The
spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve
transparency.


Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonder
people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?

   Dear Mr. Derrick:

        Les LoBaugh suggested that I contact you to inquire about an
   in-house
   counsel position at Enron. I am the General Counsel of Niagara Mohawk
   Holding's
   unregulated subsidiaries, Niagara Mohawk Energy, Inc. and Niagara Mohawk
   Energy
   Marketing, Inc. We expect the sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing to
   close
   in November or December of this year, pending FERC approval, and a sale
   of
   Niagara Mohawk Energy's Distributed Power and Energy Services Business
   units may
   occur contemporaneously with that closing. Therefore, I am now pursuing
   other
   career opportunities.

        I am a good candidate for an in-house counsel position at Enron
   because of
   my 12 years experience as an attorney in the energy industry. As General
   Counsel
   for the Company, I provide legal services and business advise to senior
   management and the Board of Directors of both the energy marketing and
   the
   energy services subsidiaries. My experience includes drafting and
   negotiating
   gas and electric retail sales agreements and master agreements and
   related
   documents for wholesale energy trading and marketing transactions,
   including
   physical transactions and financial instruments such as swaps. I monitor
   and I
   am responsible for representing my company in FERC and state regulatory
   proceedings. I keep up to date on the fast moving events and trends in
   the
   energy marketing and trading industry by closely monitoring regulatory
   proceedings, reading information that is published in trade and related
   energy
   industry publications and my involvement with the National Energy
   Marketers
   Association and the Federal Energy Bar Association. I am also
   responsible for
   representing the company and managing outside counsel in litigation and
   alternative dispute resolution proceedings. My experience includes
   utility
   regulatory and legal matters, the transactional work associated with
   corporate
   mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, human resource/employee
   issues,
   interconnection agreements, municipal law, leasing, financing and
   secured
   transaction agreements, commercial contracts, condemnation litigation
   and real
   property matters.

        I have attached my resume for your review. Please contact me at
   your
   earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing
   from
   you soon.

        Thank you for your consideration.

"Summary of NPC Meeting, Washington, D.C.","Ken:

Pete van de Gohm and I attended the NPC meeting in Washington on June 6 where the final draft Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) subcommittee document was presented to the Secretary of Energy and the NPC membership.  The draft document was accepted and the final document is being prepared.

At your request, we are pleased to continue working with Archie Dunham and the NPC subcommittee to attack the next phase of the project, the development and implementation of an Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or ISAC.  The ISAC will be the tool in providing threat information to the industry and is the main focus of the CIP project.

This next phase may require the involvement of an Enron attorney and a business lead as the ISAC will likely take the form of an LLC or similarly structured entity.  We will address these as the need arises with Jim Derrick and Steve Kean.

We feel we have made a great contribution to the energy industry by moving this project forward, and we are eagerly looking forward to our continued involvement.

Regards,

Mike Hicks

WHITMAN SAYS ENVIRONMENT STILL PROTECTED DESPITE
ANTI-TERRORISM FOCUS

Despite taking on new responsibilities in response to the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, EPA will continue to ensure the
quality of the nation's air, water, and land is protected,
Administrator Whitman says in an interview with BNA. ""We've
obviously had to reallocate, shift some resources and people
around in order to meet the responsibilities post-September
11th,"" Whitman says. But the various offices of EPA are
""continuing to do what they need to do. We're continuing to
work on the issues that are priorities."" Whitman says the
agency is not diverting resources from high-priority
matters, like superfund cleanups, ""but we've asked everyone
to go back and reprioritize and see if there are other
cleanups that are not very environmentally sensitive."" . . .

U.S. COURT AFFIRMS CLASSIFICATION OF DIOXIN AS 'KNOWN' HUMAN
CARCINOGEN

The Department of Health and Human Services acted reasonably
in upgrading dioxin from a ""reasonably anticipated"" to a
""known"" human carcinogen in the National Toxicology Program
list, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. The court's decision is
expected to have major implications for EPA's ongoing
reassessment of the risks of dioxin. The agency hopes to
complete its final reassessment of dioxin early next year. .

EMPLOYEES OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAB ACQUITTED OF CHARGES OF
FALSIFYING DATA

Eight former employees of Intertek Testing Services
Environmental Labs Inc., an environmental testing firm, are
found not guilty by a federal court jury in Dallas, Texas,
of charges that they falsified test data in order to meet
quality standards required by EPA. The lab analyzed samples
of air, liquids, soils, pesticides, explosives, and
nerve/chemical agents for consulting firms, engineering
companies, and federal, state, and local governments,
according to the Department of Justice. . . . Page A-2

EPA ENDS REVIEW OF FUMIGANT TELONE, SAYS BENEFITS OUTWEIGH
RISKS

EPA says it has ended a special review of cancer risks posed
by the fumigant telone, finding the pesticide's benefits
outweigh its risks. The fumigant is an alternative to methyl
bromide, which is being phased out under the 1987 Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. . . .

COMMENT PERIOD EXTENDED ON WHOLE EFFLUENT TOXICITY TEST
METHODS

The comment period on a proposed rule updating methods for
measuring whole effluent toxicity in effluents and the
waters into which they are discharged is extended by EPA
until Jan. 11, 2002. The proposed rule would modify whole
effluent toxicity test procedures, which seek to
characterize effluent as a whole in terms of its toxic
effects on certain test species. . . . Page A-3

BESTFOODS FOUND NOT LIABLE FOR CLEANUP COSTS AT MICHIGAN
SUPERFUND SITE

A federal court finds Bestfoods Inc. is not liable for
superfund cleanup costs at the site of a chemical
manufacturing plant in Muskegon County, Mich. The U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Michigan decides
the Englewood, N.J.-based food-processing company is not
responsible for cleanup costs because Michigan and EPA
failed to prove the company, and not its subsidiary, Ott
Chemical Co., actually operated the plant. . . . Page A-8

WORK BLOCKED IN EFFORT TO TREAT SEWAGE GENERATED BY TIJUANA,
MEXICO

Millions of gallons of Tijuana wastewater continue to flow
daily from Mexico into the United States as bureaucratic
infighting, legal challenges, and international
complications stall efforts to achieve secondary treatment
levels. Litigation and infighting block what began as a U.S.
effort to help Mexico's state of Baja California clean the
wastewater its Tijuana River brings north and into U.S.
coastal waters. . . . Page A-6

NORWAY: Strengthened regulations, increased environmental
taxes, and shifts in fuel and energy sources are credited by
the government with helping Norway cut sulfur emissions in
half between 1990 and 1999, with a further one-year
reduction of nearly 10 percent between 1999 and 2000. . . .

The Honorable Patrick J. Leahy
Chairman, United States Senate
 Committee on the Judiciary
433 Russell Senate Office Building
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator Leahy:

        I am Chairman of the Committee of Corporate General Counsel, which
is part of the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association. Our
membership is comprised of the senior-most legal officers of many of
America's largest companies.

        Our members have asked me to write to you, in your capacity as
Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to express our views concerning
the importance of the Federal Judiciary.

        The tragic events of September 11 underscore for all of us the
freedoms that we enjoy in our country. We know that you and your fellow
Senators on the Judiciary Committee are devoted to helping protect these
precious freedoms. We also know that you and your fellow Senators recognize
the critical importance of our system of justice in preserving and
protecting these freedoms.

        We write to express our thanks to you and your colleagues for your
efforts in reviewing the qualifications of individuals nominated for
Federal District Court and Circuit Court positions. Recognizing the need
for a fully-staffed Federal Judiciary, we also appreciate all your efforts
in determining the qualifications of nominees for the Judiciary as
expeditiously as possible.

         If our organization, or any of our members, may ever be of
assistance in any way, I hope you will call upon us. Thank you.


                                        Sincerely,

"FW: Security Update","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of Steve Kean@ENRON
Sent:	Tuesday, October 09, 2001 11:04 PM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Security Update


Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

"Re: Home Depot Waiver","We are fine with the waiver, subject to the usual caveat that we do not consent to your firm litigating against us.  Please let me know if there will be a more formal follow up.

Subject:	Home Depot Waiver


Vicki-I apologize again for a K&S partner having attended the initial
meeting between Enron and Home Depot yesterday before you and Jim Derrick
had an opportunity to review our waiver request.  As I mentioned to you
yesterday, none of the lawyers who worked on the Electrolux matter (myself,
Ken Culotta and Kevin Keenan) will have any involvement in the Home Depot
matter.  I can also confirm that the amount of work Erik Swenson (who would
lead the project on behalf of Home Depot) has done for Enron to date has
been minimal and none of it has involved EES's energy outsourcing business.

As I believe both clients are anxious to work on the potential transaction,
please let me know of the waiver as soon as you can.

Regards

John

"Financial Trading Agreements","Jim

Hi there, following up from my call earlier...

I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. I know that you are a director of the following companies:

Enron Trading Services Inc
Enron Metals and Commodities Ltd
Enron Metal Brokers Ltd
Enron Metals Far East Ltd

Could I ask that you confirm the following with respect to each company?

Whose signature would be required on any new trading agreement for the company?
Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?

Thanking you very much in advance for your time,

Best Regards

HOG FARMS TO INSTALL NEW TECHNOLOGY, PAY FINE FOR CLEAN
WATER VIOLATIONS

Premium Standard Farms and Continental Grain Co. reach an
agreement with EPA and a citizens group requiring the hog
producers to install as much as $50 million in new
technologies to address violations of the Clean Water Act
from their concentrated animal feeding operations. The
consent decree, which also requires the companies to pay a
$350,000 civil penalty, stems from a 1997 lawsuit brought by
the Citizens Legal Environmental Action Network against the
two companies, which together comprise the second largest
hog producer in the United States. . . . Page A-1

BALLAST WATER MANAGEMENT REPORT REQUIRED OF SHIPS ENTERING
U.S. WATERS

Ships entering U.S. waters will have to submit a ballast
water management report under a final U.S. Coast Guard rule
designed to control the introduction of invasive species.
The rule also provides voluntary ballast water management
guidelines for operators of vessels entering U.S. waters
from beyond the United States exclusive economic zone and
promotes ballast water management for all vessels operated
in U.S. waters. . . . Page A-1

UNIFORM LAW SOUGHT FOR STATES TO ENFORCE RESTRICTIONS ON
BROWNFIELDS

A proposal for a uniform law for all states to follow that
would allow land-use restrictions on contaminated property
to be enforced when ownership is transferred is being
drafted by an organization of attorneys appointed by state
governments. The goal for most polluted industrial sites,
such as brownfields, is to redevelop and to reuse the land,
according to Bill Breetz, an attorney with the National
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.
Currently, Breetz says, no state has a law making
environmental covenants on land enforceable when the
property changes hands. . . . Page A-2

COUNTER-TERRORISM BECOMES FOCUS OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
MEETING

In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, EPA
decides to place special emphasis on the subject of
counter-terrorism measures during a December meeting on
chemical emergency preparedness and prevention. EPA was
planning next month's conference before the terrorist
attacks in Washington and New York, but changes the agenda
for emergency responders, state and local emergency
planners, industry representatives, and regulators to focus
heavily on ""the best ways to combat terrorism."" . . . Page

FEDERAL COURT RULES SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA MUST BOOST MASS
TRANSIT USE

The agency responsible for transportation planning in the
San Francisco Bay Area must boost the use of public transit
to a level it set in a 1982 clean air plan. The U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California
issues the decision in a case involving a ridership goal the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission set in the Bay Area
portion of California's state implementation plan. The
opinion is a victory for environmental groups that have
spent years trying to persuade the commission to devote more
resources to programs designed to improve transit ridership.

HABITAT DESIGNATION SOUGHT FOR ENDANGERED PLANT SPECIES IN
CALIFORNIA

Two environmental groups file suit to compel the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service to designate critical habitat
protection for eight plants classified as either endangered
or threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act. The
California Native Plant Society and the Center for
Biological Diversity file the complaint in U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of California seeking
special designation for specified southern California
habitats. . . . Page A-4

TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS CONSIDERED FOR STREAMLINED
ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS

Federal highway and transit officials consider establishing
a short list of transportation projects that would be
monitored to ensure they do not get hung up in lengthy
environmental permitting and review processes. The Federal
Highway Administrator and the Federal Transit Administrator
are considering establishing a list of projects that would
receive special oversight to ensure all efforts are made to
streamline environmental reviews and permitting decisions,
an FHWA official tells a federal interagency group. . . .

NORDIC NATIONS PREPARE TO LAUNCH KYOTO RATIFICATION EFFORTS
BY YEAR END

The five Nordic governments, generally satisfied with
negotiations that completed an international climate change
agreement, will begin asking their national parliaments to
ratify the accord before the end of this year, government
officials from the five nations tell BNA. They say
ratification by all the Nordic countries should occur before
the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg
in September 2002. . . . Page A-6

TEXAS: The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
approves a new program that will allow information collected
by citizens about possible environmental violations to be
used as evidence in enforcement cases. The program, which
takes effect Jan. 1, allows citizen-collected information to
be used as evidence if certain requirements are met. . . .

the units by the state's power authority earlier this year
to meet the summer electricity needs of New York City. . . .

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office. 
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday. 
If this is not the proper protocol, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office. 
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday. 
If this is not the proper protocol, I would appreciate hearing from you.
