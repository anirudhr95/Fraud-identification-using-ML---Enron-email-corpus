To:	Derrick Jr., James; Walls Jr., Rob
Subject:	Dahbol -- Adding Greg Reid of Linklaters to the Dabhol Team

Jim/Rob -

Given the number of litigation issues, the Linklaters Dabhol team needs another senior lawyer to help lead various efforts (which I have advocated).  Christopher Walker has recommended that Greg Reid of Linklaters join the team.  I believe that Greg is currently head of Linklaters International Arbitration group.

I've spoken with Barry Hunsaker and Stephen Wallace regarding Greg.  Both had very favorable things to say about Greg:  Hard-working, detail-oriented, smart, etc.  Neither of them had any reservations about Greg although he apparently does have a sharp sense of humor (so I can see why he and Chris get along).

Greg would not handle the ""India side"" of the litigation efforts which would remain with Chris.  He would help with the ""London side"" and the lender enforcement side (to the extent that occurs outside India).  In any event, Chris would remain as the leader of the overall litigation effort and we will expect Chris to keep tabs on matters Greg is handling to ensure the overall coordination of the effort.

Let me know if you have any comments or objections to Greg's involvement.

Bruce

Subject:	Dahbol


Dear Mr Lundstrom,

from discussions with my partner, Sandeep Katwala, I understand that as the
number of issues and proceedings arising out of the Dahbol project continue
to proliferate we need to increase the partner resources devoted to the
matter.

I attach a short cv giving my professional and academic background. I have
been at Linklaters for 16 years doing litigation and arbitration . For the
last 2 years I have been co-ordinating L&A's European arbitration practice,
but have, in the past, worked closely with Chris Walker. I have also had
considerable exposure to power projects, both domestic and international
(including an involvement in the Appeal to the Supreme Court in Pakistan on
the Hub project).

Last year I successfully completed a significant arbitration for EOG. Please
feel free to call Barry Hunsaker at EOG if you would like more background on
that job. I am presently acting on a much smaller matter for Enron (taking
instructions from Stephen Wallace) that comes to hearing in London on 8/9
November.

I am presently based in Paris, but spend about one third of my time in our
London office. This is increasing and, as a result, I will be moving back to
London in July/August of next year. If you have any questions regarding my
suitability to join the team on the Dahbol project please do not hesitate to
call me direct.

yours sincerely

Subject:	Enron Middle East

Dear Sir:

My understanding is that Mr. Rick Bergsieker and you are the only directors
of Enron Middle East, Ltd., and that Mr. Darrin Donegan is the current local
manager of this company.  I also understand that Mr. Bergsieker is not with
Enron any more, Enron Middle East is still solvent, and it has very limited
indebtedness, other than my outstanding expense claims.

PLEASE READ ON.

I was an employee of Enron from 9 September 1999 to 5 December 2001 and from
1 February 2001 to the end, my Enron employer was Enron Middle East.  During
this time, I incurred business related expenses with the prior knowledge and
approval of my supervisors totaling US$90,000.  I have duly filed and had
approved these expense claims, but unfortunately have not received the
reimbursement yet.  Mr. Clay Harris was my last boss and he is still with
Enron (clay.harris@enron.com, EGM LNG team, London).  Ms. Kim Hickok
(kim.hickok@enron.com) is the current EGM HR person and has the full
documentation relating to the claim.

PLEASE READ ON.

Albeit very limited, Enron Middle East does have some assets.  I plead with
you to instruct Mr. Donegan to sell Enron Middle East's assets reimburse my
pre-agreed, appropriately lodged, and duly approved expense claims, whose
non-payment has been ruinous for my family.

I thank you for your help at these difficult times.

sums up the reasons for my academic shorcommings that have plagued my
college years at Ole Miss. I hope that things will work out so that I can
set the record straight and make my family proud. I want to think you again
for being such an anchor in my life. I wish you could come back to Madrid
for a couple of days and hang out. The weather is truly inspiring. Primavera
is here. The sun is shining and the flowers are blooming. When mom was here
we went to the Thyssien and it mad me reminisce about what a wonderful time
I had with you here. I look forward to the next time. I am also very happy
to hear of the positive results stemming from Carrin?s trip to another one
of my favorite recent memories of us together in Scottsdale. Well lets keep
are fingers crossed and if things don?t go our way then I will find a
different avenue inwhich I can succeed. love, Son

Jim:

Enron has been giving $10,000 annually to the Law & Organizational Economics Center for several years for their programs providing economic education to state judges.  I have been following the program and have been impressed by the quality of presentations and professors lecturing to state officials on such things as opportunity cost, cost/benefit analysis, and risk analysis.  Many of these judges have not had much training in economics.

Attached is a note from Henry Butler about moving his program from the University of Kansas to Chapman University, which was due to an additional financial support and a better location for operations.  A spreadsheet at the bottom shows the total number of state judges who have gone through his program since it began in the mid-1990s by state.

I have recommended to the Enron Foundation (Misha Siegel and Elyse Kalmans) that we renew the support in 2002.  You opinion might be asked as well, so I wanted to provide this to you.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Rob:

I've attached two documents:

First, an Excel Spreadsheet listing the number of judicial participants by
court and state. We do not ask the judges for their political affiliations.
In many states, the judges are elected in ""nonpartisan"" elections -- of
course, it is usually pretty clear who is what.  I imagine that there is a
""selection bias"" toward more conservative judges -- however, even if there
is such a bias, our programs are still very valuable when in comes to making
our civil justice system more predictable.  Even the pro-business judges
need to understand how to articulate the economic reasoning that supports
their pro-business instincts.  We provide them with the tools to be more
effective.

Second, a generic description of Chapman from their P.R. office.  Rest
assured, the church does not play a major role in the University.

Also, I wanted to mention to you a significant connection between Chapman
University and Enron.  The most important player at Chapman is George L.
Argyros.  George is Chairman of the Board of Trustees and a very loyal
financial supporter of the University.  I will be Dean of the George L.
Argyros School of Business and Economics.  George has been nominated by
President Bush as Ambassador to Spain.

George Argyros is also Chairman Emeritus & Treasurer of the Horatio Alger
Association.  Kenneth L. Lay is Executive Vice President of the Horatio
Alger Association.

I suspect that Mr. Argyros and Mr. Lay have worked closely in their
leadership capacities with the Horatio Alger Association.

I would hope that this connection would result in a much larger contribution
to the Chapman LOEC.  Do you have any suggestions about how to proceed?

Checks should be made payable to ""Chapman LOEC"" and sent to me at the
address below.

Thanks for Enron's support.

Hope all is well with you.

Sincerely,

Henry

Jim,

I am looking forward to working with Michelle to Co-Chair the 2002 event.  We appreciate your confidence in us and are honored to be the Co-Chairs.   Michelle Cash and her team did set a high standard and also put in place the ground work to help ensure successful events for the future.  I know Michelle Cash has a notebook of information that she would like to pass on to the next Chairs.  We will schedule a meeting with Michelle Cash shortly.

In a message dated 11/6/01 2:14:20 PM Pacific Standard Time, David.Oxley@ENRON.com writes: 
I don't understand why this would be construed as evasion. 
David, it can be challenged by Canadian tax authorities as an unlawful evasion if the taxable event has already occurred, and the tax is owed both by an employee as income tax and by the employer for withholding tax.  An arrangement or scheme that attempts to undo a taxable event that has already occurred may be challenged as a collusive attempt to evade taxes already due and owing.  It is kind of like trying to push the toothpaste back in the tube; it can be a mess. 
Just because we may not understand it does not mean there is no problem.  Based on Enron's policy of compliance with the law in jurisdictions in which it does business, it is my recommendation that a written opinion of Canadian tax counsel be obtained based on a review of the facts and the documents. 
I see this as a sensitive area that requires prudence and, if necessary, an extra step to make sure that reasonable steps are taken to make sure that Enron policy is observed and complied with.

Jim,

B&M are our lead firm in Japan, and are used extensively by Jane McBride, and also on a more sporadic basis by businesses in London (eg metals and the Wind business) which have operations in Japan. Enron Wind in Japan have appointed Paul Davies of B&M in Tokyo to act on a joint venture for Enron Wind in Japan.

In the summer of 2000, we undertook some basic physical gas due diligence re gas in the Ukraine utilising Baker & McKenzie's Kiev office.  This was in preparation for a potential long-term gas deal to get gas out of the Ukraine to the Romanian border (for onward sale in Romania / Poland).  B&M was the only ""recognised"" firm in the Ukraine.

That's it.

As you know, EES is positioning itself to supply power to retail customers
in Massachusetts.  In order to do so, it must enter a Competitive Electric
Service Supplier Agreement with a local utility, Western Mass.  The
agreement governs the relationship between EES and the utility (subject to
the utility's tariff and PUC regulations), and mainly concerns billing and
other administrative matters.   I would not expect large dollar disputes to
arise under the agreement (barring another California situation).  The
agreement presently calls for arbitration in Boston of any disputes.  There
are no rules specified.  I recommend that we agree to arbitration in Boston
but specify that:  (1) the Federal Arbitration Act will apply (to give a
legal framework to the arbitration and to enable EES to invoke federal
court jurisdiction); (2) the arbitration will be conducted in accordance
with the CPR Rules for Self-Administered Arbitrations (although AAA or JAMS
would also be acceptable);  and (3) one arbitrator will be used in the
amount in dispute is less than $1 million but if greater then the parties
will use a panel of three arbitrators, with each party selecting one (under
CPR Rules the two party appointed arbitrators select the chair or, failing
agreement, the CPR submits a list of 5 from which the chair is determined
by the highest order of preference of the parties).   Please let me know if
this meets your approval.  Thanks.

Bill and Mary, unfortunately, it appears that Carrin and I will not be able
to attend after all.  An Enron Policy Committee (essentially, our executive
committee, of which I am a member) meeting has been called for Monday, and
I must attend it in person.  The flights from LA to Houston on Sunday night
depart too early to enable us to attend the LA event, and the earliest
flight on Monday morning arrives in Houston too late for me to attend the
Policy Committee meeting timely.  We are extremely disappointed, as you may
imagine.  We are very appreciative of your kind invitation and look forward
to seeing both of you soon. We will watch the event on television in the
hope that we see you being interviewed. I know you will represent us well!
Let us know if your plans include a Houston trip--we would welcome the

   Hi Jim--

   I just got back from San Francisco.  We are delighted you will be
   joining us.  It will be a fun night.

   We are hiring limos to take us to and from the Shrine Auditorium.
   Because both John Quinn and I live in Pasadena, the limos will be
   picking us up and dropping us off there.  Also, we are likely to have a
   dinner following the awards ceremony in Pasadena.  So--my recommendation
   would be for you to stay at the Ritz Carlton in Pasadena.

   Your voice message said that you have not finalized travel plans yet.
   If you get out in time for dinner on Saturday, we should get together.
   As soon as you have your reservations, give me a call or e-mail me.  My
   direct dial at work is 213-533-8667.  My cell phone is 818-519-8751.
   Mary's cell is 818-519-8750.

   I think it would be productive for you to spend some time with us on
   Monday morning.  know the people working on your matters would like to
   meet you.  Perhaps I could pick you up on the way to work on Monday.

      Hi Jim--

      The last month or so have been so hectic I have barely had time to
      breath.  We have gone from fire to fire.  Over the last 24 hours
   (since
      we submitted our last hurry up brief) I have been reflecting on the
      experience.  To say it has been positive is an understatement.

      Under ordinary circumstances working under such continual
   pressure--with
      so much $ on the line--would have been stressful.  However, when you
      work with Enron the opposite is true.  There is such a sense of
   esprit
      d' corp that permeates your organization.  It makes difficult things
      easy and the impossible, just another day in the office.

      There are no egos to trip over at Enron.  When there is a problem to
      solve, it is everyone's problem.  People are not afraid of asking
      questions.  They keep questioning until they understand.  Nobody
   minds
      repeating themselves.  They are incredibly patient with outside
      lawyers--spending hours and hours bringing us up to speed.  As you
   well
      know, yours is not a simple business.  It is so refreshing.

      There are so many benefits to this team approach.

      1.  You get things right the first time.  As you know, in any
   litigation
      is critical that the court view your side as the teller of truth.
      Because you get things right the first time,  the company is not
   exposed
      to being discredited when the other side responds.

      2.  I would bet that Enron's outside legal bills are half what they
      would be otherwise.  With most companies the outside (and inside)
      lawyers get a minimum of support from the business people.  The
   business
      people view business as business and lawsuits as an annoyance.  (I
      should say that I could never understand that given the direct
   Perhaps
      it is the trader mentality at the company.  Perhaps it is an
   unwavering
      focus on the bottom line.  Perhaps it is just that everyone feels
   they
      are a part of a team and they realize that by working together the
   team
      can achieve things that no one person can do working alone.  Whatever
      the reason, the outside lawyer's job is made so much easier.  That
      results in much, much lower legal bills.

      3. You increase your chances of winning.  The brainstorming is so
      valuable.

      4. The outside lawyers, like me, feel they are part of the team.
      Outside lawyers do not feel as if they are on trial.  They can ask
   the
      dumb questions.  I know that all of us here are looking forward to
   the
      next opportunity to work with the Enron team.

      5.  Human nature being what it is--I think that when there are
   choices
      to be made as to whose work goes on the top of the pile--the Enron
      assignment goes to the top more often than not.

      You have built a great legal team.  All of your legal staff should be
      proud of what they have built.


      Thanks for letting us come along for the ride.

Jim,

B&M are our lead firm in Japan, and are used extensively by Jane McBride, and also on a more sporadic basis by businesses in London (eg metals and the Wind business) which have operations in Japan. Enron Wind in Japan have appointed Paul Davies of B&M in Tokyo to act on a joint venture for Enron Wind in Japan.

In the summer of 2000, we undertook some basic physical gas due diligence re gas in the Ukraine utilising Baker & McKenzie's Kiev office.  This was in preparation for a potential long-term gas deal to get gas out of the Ukraine to the Romanian border (for onward sale in Romania / Poland).  B&M was the only ""recognised"" firm in the Ukraine.

That's it.

We settled this case at mediation yesterday for a $125,000 payment by Omnicomp and a $125,000 payment by Steve Heinz.  The reason we settled is that we had some exposure (the two mock juries both came back in favor of Linton, awarding an average of $1 million in damages), and the estimated cost of litigation through trial and appeal was $150,000-$175,000.  Our counsel, Tom Allen of Reed Smith, did an excellent job with the case, and I would recommend using him again.  Please call me with any questions.

Jim,  I cannot thank you enough for those incredibly kind words.  It will take a bit of time for my frustration to subside, but in the meantime we must carry on.  I am arranging a meeting with Jonathan to see if he can shed some light on this strange opinion and on why we were denied our costs on the restitution point.  He may not be available until after Easter.  I have spoken to Laurence who describes the opinion as pathetic.  Perhaps even more interesting and somewhat troubling is the fact that it was actually Pollack who said to Laurence that Enron had been ""stitched up"" by the Lords and that the opinion was a joke.  I do not want to sound like a sore loser, but it does make one think this is a bit of a kangaroo court if the winning counsel says the result is a joke.  Anyway, it is not a very funny one.  In all seriousness perhaps we should consider whether we ought to modify our policy permitting submitting to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.  I realize they have not historically honored the non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses, but at least it might give us a fighting chance to go to a more neutral venue like Switzerland.  Anyway, give it some thought.  I will let you know as soon as I have been able to speak with Jonathan.  Again, many thanks for your wonderful support every step of the way.

Subject:	CATS litigation

Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The opinion seeks to conclude ""what rational businessmen could have intended"" rather than applying the provisions of the contract.  

For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that the  ""retrospective consequences"" of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.

As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.

Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have been a given. 

Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our other counsel have assessed the opinion as ""appalling"" and ""pathetic,"" and describe the situation as one where Enron has been ""stitched up"".  Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse.

In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. 

Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207 783 6582.  Many thanks.

Subject:	Canadian Retail

Jim and Mark, as you know, we have established a retail affiliate within Enron Canada known as Enron Direct.  In addition, EES has a Canadian entity, EES Canada, which was established for the purposes of entering into some cross-border transactions in Canada.  For various reasons, it has been decided to roll Enron Direct into EES Canada reporting, commercially, to Rob Milnthorp, who will in turn report to Dave Delainey.  There are two legal/governance-related issues that I wanted to raise with you:

1.	Governance:  As a result, it will be necessary to make various corporate re-organizations to EES Canada.  This will include having EES Canada established as an Alberta corporation, where Enron Canada has, and Enron Direct will have, its principal Canadian office.  In relation to this, I was considering that EES Canada should be organized consistent with Enron Canada, with two Canadian resident nominee directors and Canadian-resident officers.  A few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related ""permanent establishment"" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada.  Accordingly, Enron Canada was re-organized with a nominee board of directors consisting of Rob Milnthorp (as the senior commercial employee) and me (as the senior legal employee) with a Canadian slate of officers being the Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or commercial-support groups.  I was thinking of doing likewise with EES Canada.  Although I have not yet obtained a copy of the corporate records for EES Canada, I believe the current directors of EES Canada are Jim and an outside lawyer at Blake, Cassels & Graydon in Toronto, Ernest McNee.  I am not sure, but it is also likely that various US-based employees of EES are designated as the officers of EES Canada.  Would it be appropriate to re-organize EES Canada along the same lines that Enron Canada has been organized, or do you have concerns?

2.	Law Firm:  Following-up on our conversation last week, I want to confirm that our continued use of Donahue Ernst & Young for this retail project was ""grandfathered"" on the basis that they were ""up the learning curve"" on a number of the contracting, regulatory, licensing and market participation issues.  There is one twist, however, with respect to EES Canada.  Although I was not involved, I believe that EES Canada was established to execute on some gas transactions in Ontario with the use of a Blakes partner in Toronto, Ernest McNee.  However, as the focus of the business initiative in Canada will, at least in the near future, be more involved and predominantly, if not entirely, in Alberta; and as Donahue Ernst & Young is involved in regulatory proceedings on our behalf with respect to market design issues affecting the Alberta gas and power markets, as well as being familiar with the licensing and contracting requirements for Enron Direct in Alberta; and given my understanding that Blakes' involvement with EES Canada has been relatively limited, I think it would make sense to have Donahue Ernst & Young continue on with this matter.  I am, however, sensitive to Jim's concerns, and therefore wanted your thoughts on the matter.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Peter

DEAR SIR,

A REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE/COOPERATION

IT IS WITH GREAT PLEASURE IN WRITING YOU THIS LETTER ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES AND ME.  YOUR PARTICULARS WERE GIVEN TO ME BY A MEMBER OF THE NIGERIAN EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL (NNPC) WHO WAS AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DELEGATION TO YOUR COUNTRY DURING A TRADE EXHIBITION.  I HAVE DECIDED TO SEEK A CONFIDENTIAL COOPERATION WITH YOU IN THE EXECUTION OF THE DEAL DESCRIBED HERE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL PARTIES INVOLVED AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL KEEP IT AS TOP SECRET BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS AND THE PERSONALITIES INVOLVED.

WITHIN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES WHERE I WORK AS A DIRECTOR, PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND WITH THE COOPERATION OF FOUR OTHER TOP OFFICIALS, WE HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION AS OVER-DUE PAYMENT BILLS TOTALLING $30.5M USD (THIRTY MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS) WHICH WE WANT TO TRANSFER ABROAD WITH THE ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION OF A TRUSTED FOREIGN FIRM OR INDIVIDUAL WHO WILL RECEIVE THE SAID FUND ON OUR BEHALF INTO ANY ACCOUNT PROVIDED TO RECEIVE SUCH FUNDS.  WE ARE HANDICAPPED IN THIS DEAL BECAUSE THE CIVIL SERVICE CODE OF
CONDUCT DOES NOT ALLOW PUBLIC SERVANTS LIKE US TO OPERATE OFFSHORE ACCOUNT, HENCE YOUR IMPORTANCE IN THE WHOLE TRANSACTION.

THE AMOUNT $18.6M USD REPRESENTED SOME PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE EXECUTED ON BEHALF OF MY MINISTRY BY A FOREIGN CONTRACTING FIRM WHICH WE THE OFFICIALS OVER-INVOICED DELIBERATELY. THOUGH THE ACTUAL CONTRACT COST HAVE BEEN PAID TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR, LEAVING THE BALANCE IN THE TUNE OF THE SAID AMOUNT WHICH WE HAVE GOTTEN APPROVAL TO REMIT BY TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER (T.T.) TO
FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNT YOU WILL PROVIDE BY FILING IN AN APPLICATION THROUGH MY MINISTRY FOR THE TRANSFER OF RIGHT AND PRIVILEGES OF THE FORMER CONTRACTOR TO YOU.

SINCE THE PRESENT NEW CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT OF MY COUNTRY IS DETERMINED TO PAY EVERY FOREIGN CONTRACTOR ALL DEBTS OWED, SO AS TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL FINANCIAL AGENCIES, WE HAVE DECIDED TO INCLUDE OUR BILL FOR APPROVALS WITH THE COOPERATION OF SOME OFFICIALS FROM THE ALL THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRY WHICH WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE PAYMENT PROCESS.

WE ARE SEEKING YOUR ASSISTANCE IN PROVIDING A VITAL  ACCOUNT INTO WHICH WE CAN REMIT THIS MONEY BY ACTING AS OUR MAIN PARTNER AND TRUSTEE OR ACTING AS THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR.  THIS WE CAN DO BY SWAPPING OF ACCOUNT AND CHANGING OF BENEFICIARY AND OTHER FORMS OF DOCUMENTATION UPON APPLICATION FOR CLAIM TO REFLECT THE PAYMENT AND APPROVALS TO BE SECURED ON BEHALF OF YOU.

JVD, just wanted to tell you how much I am enjoying my little medicine ball.  I walk around with it a lot.  When I am on the telephone, it substitutes for a doodle.  As a matter of fact, I just got back from doing the stairs and on about the second floor, I realized I was holding it. It has kind of taken the place of a ""worry rock"" .  In the meantime, it is providing me with the much needed strength and dexterity in my arm, wrist and hand.  

Thanks again for all you do for me.  I love working for you.  You are a very sweet man and I appreciate it.

Mr. Derrick,

Our firm has been retained by Enron on a variety of matters over the last few years but we have not yet met.  I will be in your Houston offices on Tuesday, April 17th.  I am writing to ask if you would be available to meet sometime that afternoon.

You may recall meeting my partner, Mike Morgan, in Portland about three to four years ago.  Mike has worked with Enron on the PGE/Sierra deal and other matters as well.

I am the senior partner at our firm who specializes in labor and employment law.  I am a former partner at Littler Mendelson in San Francisco and continue to enjoy a close relationship with that firm.

I have been working with Rick Johnson, Director of Labor and Employment Relations at Enron Corp.  We have been handling the labor issues associated with an energy management agreement--Project Neon.  Rich Freed is lead counsel.  We are working on a project labor agreement in connection with the construction of a power plant--Project Epic.  Randy Pais is overseeing that matter.  We are also working with Marty Keyser on some potential  O & M issues at EFS.

On April 17th, I will be having lunch with Michelle Cash, Sharon Butcher, Kriste Sullivan and Rick.  In the morning I will be meeting with representatives of EFS, EES and EEOS.

My flight on the 17th leaves at about 5:30 pm.  Rick and I would be available to stop by your office sometime after lunch on the 17th.

Please let me know if you are available to meet with us.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Victor Kisch

Subject:	In re F&J Representation
Importance:	High



	I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:

	1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.

	2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.

	3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.

	4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:

	a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the ""Method and System for the Determination of VAR"").

	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.

	c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.

	Proposed going forward strategy:

	Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.

	Britt

				.

Dear Friend,

I am Dr Rasheed Mohammed, the newly appointed head of
the Foreign Remittance Department in the Central Bank
of Nigeria (CBN). I got your contact from a business
directory of your country and based on your business
activities and the type of investment I have in mind,
I found you to be the most suitable person for the
transaction stated below.

 Before I proceed, I want to strongly advice that you
devoid yourself from the general conception you have
about Nigerians. I would like you to carefully study
this proposal without bias, since it would be relevant
in our lives.

It is a usual practice in Nigeria for ministers and
high-ranking government officials to divert
government's money into their private accounts; this
is usually done through CBN with the connivance of
senior officials. The ministers and military generals
especially during the era of late general sani Abacha,
achieve this by diverting most of the funds, meant for
the development of their respective agencies and
ministries into the CBN escrow accounts. Usually it is
this same escrow account that holds funds for the
payment of foreign contracts.  With the help of the
inside officials, the minister or senior government
officials and military generals would now create
themselves or employ the assistance of a foreign
partner to create them as artificial contractors,
using fiticious documents to remit the deposited money
to the nominated bank account of their foreign
partners. In this case the money is treated as payment
for foreign contract, and there is no trace. This is
how federal government's money is siphoned on a
regular basis, to the extent that most people now
result to letter scams and fraud due to the knowledge
they have about it.

Due to the impromptu removal of my successor from the
central bank, he did not have enough time to perfect
and tidy up the transactions they have in place. So
the funds are now trapped at the central bank escrow
account with no records. I just discovered this in a
bid to fulfill my obligation to submit the state of
our escrow account to the federal government and the
governor of CBN before I commence any foreign payment.
I am conducting a sort of reconciliation of our escrow
account to declare to the government the total amount
that have been spent in the last three years and what
it was spent for. So,  in the course of carrying out
the above exercise, I discovered a total sum of
$150MILLION in the escrow account that is unknown to
anyone and with no records. My intention is to reveal
about USD $100M to the federal government so that I
can be in his good books and make arrangement to
transfer the outstanding USD $50M into a safe account
abroad. It is based on this that I am making this
urgent contact with you.


However, I am doing this because of the nature of my
job. I am a civil servant that is poorly paid and more
so, there is no way I can remain in this office
forever. I have children to cater for even when I
retire as the director, which is just next year. So, I
need something tangible to fall back on when I retire.
Besides, if I declare the total funds to the
government, it would probably go into the pockets of a
few people that control the government. This is to
enlighten you on the degree of corruption in Nigeria.
So, do not blame me for my action because you would do
the same if you were in my shoes, knowing fully well
that there will be no compensation even if you
disclose everything to the government.

Well, I have discovered that I can transfer this money
if we could quickly create you as an artificial
contractor, by using your company document and Bank
account to receive the money, in the same way my
successor transferred theirs. The only difference is
that the final payment is going to be made to your
named company through any of our correspondent payment
center in Europe or America, due to the policies
adopted by the new democratic government.

The entire process is not easy, but it is achievable
due to my position in the foreign remittance
department of the CBN, and the relationship I have
with the present director of external payment and
finance of the federal ministry of finance.

The entire operation will be between the three of us:
(I) I shall take care of all documentation, (ii) My
friend in the federal ministry of finance will take
care of all lobbying and use of influence to get all
documentation, (iii) You shall take care of the
banking arrangements, provide the needed invoices to
enable us apply for claims and approvals and travel as
the beneficiary to receive the funds from the payment
center you shall be paid from.

After we have succeeded in transferring this funds,
20% shall be retained by you for your assistance, 5%
for the settlement of all debts we might incur in the
course of this transaction and the remaining 75% shall
be for me and my colleague, which we would possibly
invest in into your company or any viable business
venture you suggest.

If you are comfortable with this programme please
revert to me at once via telephone number
234-1-7593507 or fax number 234-1-7590440. Should your
response be positive, I would then instruct on the
next step to take.

Due to security reasons, when you call, do not ask for
any name, simply ask me to reconfirm the telephone
number. Once I reconfirm my number to be
234-1-7593507, you can then mention my name before you
go into any discussion. If I fail to reply correctly,
do not wait for a second trial, just drop the phone
and call back later.

We demand a quick response from you. Any delay might
result in contacting someone else. Irrespective of
what happens, we count on your maturity to keep the
transaction to yourself. So, you are advised to treat
this transaction with utmost confidentiality.

Looking forward to your urgent response.

Yours faithfully,

Dr Rasheed Mohammed

Jim -

Linklaters and an Enron rep interviewed QC candidates in London that can
help with our commercial PRI policy issues on Dabhol.  The commercial

Gaisman.

I'd like your permission to retain and put some of our PRI policy questions

Subject:  QCs

Bruce,

Peter, Sophie and I met with all four QC's this morning.

The clear choice, in all of our minds, is Jonathan Gaisman.  (See attached
file: Jonathan Gaisman.doc)His litigation practice is prinicipally
insurance related.  He has done political risk insurance matters relating
to Eastern Europe.  He spoke definitively about practices of different
underwriters in the market (i.e., to re-insure, to craft policies, etc.) He
knows, quite well, the small community of barristers who may be called upon
by Lloyds to handle this.  His wife is from India (though Scottish) and he
spends holiday time there and knows the country and the people.  He worked
on North Sea disputes representing Enron in the past.  He is
straightforward, inquisitive, prepared, thoughtful, and interested in
working on this with us.  He is also used to working with large American
clients.  The downside is that, in his words, he does ""not have limitless
time.""  He is expecting to be involved in a rather large case in the first
half of next year.

Alistair Schaff was not a very seasoned barrister, and unprepared for our
meeting (in the sense that he hadn't even bothered to read anything about
us or the case before we got there  --  I did not get the sense he was too
busy to do so).  He has worked on de facto 'takings' in Iraq cases, and has
had a number of cases that have involved questions of mitigation.  In
addition, he seemed familiar with the option to sue clause in many
policies.  He has done some work in the distant past with the GOI on
letters of credit and shipping matters.  He was the only one that mentioned
that we might spend some time in the near term thinking about what events
we might 'cause' to occur that could help our claims.

Richard Jacobs is a fairly young barrister, but had read up on our case and
did some preliminary research on case law on political risk insurance
issues (which, incidentally, all four barristers agree hardly exists).  He
did some PRI work in Russia in the early 1990s, and represented brokers in
a lender PRI claim regarding a South Seas power station. He stated that
many insurance coverage issues (no matter the type of policy) are basically
the same questions with a different twist.    Interestingly, he has just
given some advice to a European investor about a dispute in India on a
power plant (contractual matter, not insurance related).  He definitely
grasped that a detailed review of the facts would be the driver for an
expropriation claim.  He has travelled to India.  He has capacity to work
with us in the next 4-8 weeks and beyond.  He would be a solid guy to use
as a back-up.

Stewart Boyd, as you will recall from his CV, is an experienced barrister
(58 years old), who sits as an international arbitrator often. He has a
relationship with Lord Mustill, for what that is worth.  He does alot of
insurance and re-insurance work, though he says that not many political
risk insurance cases have reached the bar.  He has worked on a leading case
involving ECGD, and was, interestingly, an expert witness in an OPIC
coverage case recently.  {We may consider him for just that role, on the
DIC issue, should we decide to sue in Texas.} He has dealt with many
projects of this type and magnitude, from a contractual dispute point of
view, and done quite a bit of work in the electricity sector on
privatization matters.  He has done a couple of projects (shipping and
petroleum industry) in India.  He is available for the next couple of
weeks, booked for most of December, and then frees up again.  I would rank
him a strong second choice.

I would propose that we issue Gaisman instructions tomorrow or Monday.  If
you agree, let me know and I will take care of it.

Kim

We need to advise the Executive Committee members that the November 2

RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have determined
to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date. I
hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have already
made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
<mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of your
availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

a) ____________

b) ____________

c) ____________

d) ____________

After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting for
the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members and
notify you of the new date.

Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that we
have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.

Subject:	Argentina Stamp Tax

In response to a ""test case"" declaratory judgment lawsuit filed by TGS (with our input) over one year ago, the Supreme Court of Argentina today issued an order enjoining the province of Santa Cruz from enforcing its stamp tax levy pending a full hearing and ruling by the Court on the legality of the stamp tax.  Although this is not a ruling on the merits, it does indicate how the Supreme Court is leaning, at least for the present.  This is a very significant victory for TGS and, if the Court continues in this direction, will result in TGS being relieved of stamp tax liability (approximately $650 million).  A great deal of the credit for this goes to Michelle Blaine, who worked with the TGS lawyers on the filing.  Please call me or Michelle with any questions.

I believe that the Resolutions No. 4, 6 and 9 are not correct in terms of the text:

1. resolution no. 4 is not correct since the S.Board did not review the new (attached) changes to the budget and did not approve it. There was also an amandement to the text of the Resolution re. the line items and the total amounts exeeding the approved budget.	

I believe that the draft Budget with the new amendemends must be reviewed once again as a whole at the next Sup.Board meeting before it can be enacted.

2. Resoltuions No. 6 and 9 - the vote descritpion is not correct

There are lots of employees wondering if/how they should react to all the class actions being filed, esp. those that are filed with employee plaintiffs and /or relate to benefit plans. It might be helpful to let people know how class actions work, that they don't need to sign up to be lead plaintiffs, that if awards or settlements occur they will have a chance to participate later, will be notified, etc. This might calm people down and avoid a stampede if rumors start flying around that if people don't sign up or join now they will be left out.

I understand that Jim will come here on Sunday night. We'll book him a room
at the Atlanta Ritz-Carlton, right next to the office.
Bobby will arrive Monday in time for lunch and we'll set up a few people
anxious to talk to Jim after lunch.
We will leave here about 4:15 to arrive and drive down Magnolia Lane at 6:30
p.m. Take a tour, have a putting contest or whatever, drinks and dinner.
Next morning we'll play 18, have lunch and play either the par 3 or another
nine, then leave about 4:30 to get Sam back to Atlanta in time for a dinner
he has here that night.Jim and Bobby could catch any plane after about 9 or
spend the night here. Let us know if you want hotel reservations for Tuesday
night. If so, do you want to play East Lake Wed. a.m.?
NO SHORTS,ONLY LONG PANTS at Augusta.
I think no cell phones, too. I have the caddies yardage book, which the
three of us can memorize on the way over.
Sam shot 69!!!! last weekend at a nearby course, so we'll see if the secret
can stay around that long.

Jim -- 

We would appreciate your blessing on this revised Q&A for the web.  All of the questions previously of most concern to you have been removed.  We have added in a question about related parties and basically put in the broad FASB parameters.  The Q&A enables us to stick in some fashion to the commitment Ken made on the last analyst call while also removing some low-end calls into public relations from people who have no idea what any of this means.

Thanks

Vance Meyer

Subject:	FW: Enron compliance program and summary

I previously mentioned to you that Enron may have to enter into a consent decree with the FCC relating to Enron's failure to file for authorization to transfer FCC licenses held by Portland General Corporation in connection with the 1997 merger.  Before the FCC prepares a draft consent decree they asked that we submit a proposed Compliance Program.  V&E prepared the attached compliance program and summary.  As you can see by the date on the e:mail from Bob Mazer I have had the draft for a couple weeks and have not reviewed it until today.  I have spoken to a couple people in Regulatory Affairs to see if they would be interested in taking ownership of this compliance program.  They don't want it. Sue Nord, who covers EBS for regulatory affairs, is checking with outside counsel used by EBS to see if they agree that we must enter into the consent decree.  I am concerned about Enron's ability to implement this program and want to get your prospective on it.  I am also concerned about whether or not we have other violations that will come to light after we sign the consent decree.  As far as I can tell, at this point Enron doesn't have a centralized system for tracking FCC licenses.  Please let me know what you think the next steps should be for reviewing this compliance program and responding to V&E.

Jim,

B&M are our lead firm in Japan, and are used extensively by Jane McBride, and also on a more sporadic basis by businesses in London (eg metals and the Wind business) which have operations in Japan. Enron Wind in Japan have appointed Paul Davies of B&M in Tokyo to act on a joint venture for Enron Wind in Japan.

In the summer of 2000, we undertook some basic physical gas due diligence re gas in the Ukraine utilising Baker & McKenzie's Kiev office.  This was in preparation for a potential long-term gas deal to get gas out of the Ukraine to the Romanian border (for onward sale in Romania / Poland).  B&M was the only ""recognised"" firm in the Ukraine.

That's it.

Importance:	High

Jim -- We have been getting a large number of media calls about the 14A filing, which discusses Ken Lay's change of control provision in his contract.  We would like to use the following with media -- and internal meetings with employees:

	Change of control provisions are very common at the CEO level.  Ken has had a change of control provision in his employment contract since 1989.  It enables him to trigger an involuntary termination in the event of a change of control, which includes a merger or consolidation with another corporation and Enron is not the surviving corporation.  This would have gone into effect in the event of a hostile takeover or the announced merger with Dynegy.


Please let me know ASAP if we are able to use this statement.

Thank you.

    This is your reminder of our special meeting next Friday to continue
our long-range planning and restructuring of the IOGEC as we expand our
scope and membership to include new fields of energy law.  A number of
the issues left on the table at our mid-year meeting in August should be
resolved now as we get ready for the annual Institute in February and
begin a concurrent membership drive.  Lunch will be served.  As we have
much to discuss, the meeting may run to 4:00 or so.

    If you have not yet advised David Winn whether you will attend,
please do so now ( dwinn@swlegal.org <mailto:dwinn@swlegal.org> ;

        An agenda will be sent to you next week in advance of the
meeting. Thanks again for your wisdom and your leadership.

Given Whalley's promotion, it looks like the Xcelerator will remain under Corporate, rather than moving to EWS as expected when we last spoke.  Given that change, would you like for me to continue to request support from Mark Haedicke's group or is there someone in the corporate area you'd rather I approach.  Whatever route you suggest is fine with me.

Most pressingly, I'd like to discuss our ability to compete with a company with which we've been in discussions -- if possible by the latter part of the week.

Thank you.

Hi Mark,
I am a former investor, and received a complaint in yesterday's mail from
Bernstein, Liebhard & Lifshitz.  Although their complaint may have some
merit, they fail to point out that in early 2001 (1/21/2001- I bought @ 70
1/8 & sold 9 days later @ 79.5), there was significant press relating to
the energy crisis- Lack of electricity in California, and shortages of
petroleum reserves, etc.  That is why I bought.  I saw an opportunity for
energy companies overall, with regards to sales volume & earnings
potential.
So, although their claims may (or may not) have substantive legal merit
(with regards to the  Limited Partnership debacle), I, and perhaps others,
bought and/or sold the stock due to circumstances related only to the
energy crises, and opportunities related therein.
Although I'm a small investor (traded only $ 1,540 worth of shares, as
noted above), feel free to write if I can help.

Jim - 
 
I'm glad we got to say a brief  hello several Mondays ago, when I was in your shop for a couple of days  helping with a third party document production.  That was, I believe,  just the day before all hell broke loose at Enron.
 
As a strong admirer of the Enron  legacy, it has been sad for me to watch events unfold over the last month.   Also, I sincerely hope you will be OK personally and in good shape  professionally when all the smoke finally clears.
 
This note is also a reminder that,  with the enormous gatherings of inf0rmation facing your organization in the  coming months -- between investigations, due diligence, and  shareholder suit discovery  -- I am still available to come help with those  needs.  Over and above my self-serving interest in having the work, on a  very personal level I'd like to be able to help out.
 
In case it is needed, another copy  of my resume is attached.  
 
Good luck, Jim, and hang  tough.

Dear Mark,

Do you have any news re our acting for a client in acquiring an equity stake
in Wessex Water? I am being chased by my partners about obtaining clearance
for them to act.

Please excuse me for in turn chasing you about this; I certainly appreciate
that you will have more important matters at your hands to deal with these

clients time is of the essence; I am sure that you will understand this.

Subject:	Dabhol Power Project -  Notice of Conciliation (GOI)

Bruce and Gail,

I attach a rough first draft of the necessary Notice of Conciliation.

In its final form this needs to go in late tommorrow afternoon in New Delhi
if DPC is to be in a position to commence arbitration against the GOI as
quickly as is possible. There is any event 60 days of deadtime. There is no
sensible way of getting around that. Accordingly,the sooner DPC starts the
process,the sooner it gets to serve the necessary Notice of Arbitration.

It follows that if DPC wishes to get on with matters with the GOI as quickly
as is possible,this Notice of Conciliation requires to go in quickly.

Who does DPC wish to appoint as a conciliator (bearing in mind that DPC does
not genuinely wish to go through a full-blown conciliation,but simply wishes
to tee-up an arbitration on day 61)?

Laurence Street,whose name I have inserted,was the Chief Justice of NSW,and
is now in his mid-70s (but fairly fit and active; I saw him last at an ICCA
conference in New Delhi about 10 months ago). After ceasing to be a Judge he
did quite a lot arbitration. He was also the chairman (and an active
chairman) of Fairfax,a major Australian newspaper and media company and an
ASX component stock. Fairfax was the subject of a hostile bid,and had a
tough time with the Australian government.  As the chairman of Fairfax
Street has had some real business experience,but is also a pretty serious
lawyer. His main activity these days is mediation. He has done a lot of
it,mostly in high-profile Australian corporate disputes. If the conciliation
goes anywhere (which I tend to doubt) Street is about the most suitable
person I can think of at short notice.

If anyone has any better idea as to the identity of the conciliator,please
feel free to say so. If not,given that we have to cut quite quickly,my
suggestion and recommendation is that we go with Street.

Subject:  Indian Counsel


Bruce,

Justice PN Bhagwati
For many years he was the Chief Justice of India - and was responsible for
many of the landmark decisions passed by the Supreme Court. After
retirement
from the Supreme Court he has pursued a career as an arbitrator and has
been
involved on a number of international arbitrations. As a separate career he
provides legal opinions on commercial matters. He is currently recognised
as
one of if not the outstanding senior lawyers in India. He with Justice
Chandrachud are probably India's best known arbitrators.

Has an outstanding reputation as an intellect to be reckoned with - in the
conferences I have had with him (on Metgas) and in Chris and Atul's
dealings
with him you have to marvel at his speed of thought despite the years.

Our primary concern with him appearing on the other side either for GOI or
GOM as their arbitrator, apart from his capability, is the simple fact that
he is extremely busy. If GOI or GOM want to slow down an arbitration
proceeding then in Atul's words ""there can be no better choice than Mr
Bhagwati"".

He has chaired several commissions - eg he wrote the revised Takeover Code.
He has also been responsible for much of the insolvency legislation.

I don't have sufficient details on Justices Chandrachud and Chandurkar and
could I please ask Chris to forward these to Bruce.

Sandeep

Subject:	DPC -- London Commercial Court Filing

Folks -

We had a lawyer conference call today to discuss the prospect of filing a
suit in London Commercial Court to enjoin the GOM from trying to file a
suit in India to void the GOM Guarantee and State Support Agreements.

Chris Walker, local counsel, GE and Bechtel support filing the suit.  Other
than Jim McCartney, the Enron representatives support filing the suit.  In
the end, Jim McCartney defers to Chris Walker's judgment.

Filing suit in London has some risks.  We are uncertain of the response of
the India Supreme Court, the GOM and the current GOM/DPC arbitration panel.
The Supreme Court may take offense to the filing (although Chris thinks
that this risk is small).  In a perverse way, our filing in London could
further induce GOM to file in India (although we believe that they will in
any event).  The current arbitration panel may use this as an opportunity
to wait until the underlying DPC/MSEB dispute is decided (although Chris
doubts it).

My understanding is that Enron commercial supports the filing of the suit.
It is scheduled to be filed on Friday. If any of you would like to revisit
the issue before Friday, please let me know.

Bruce

Christopher -

I agree with your observations.  It seems to me that we want to consolidate
our Dec/Jan/Good Interest into one arbitration against each of MSEB and
GOM, rather than separate the claims further and thereby encourage MSEB/GOM
to cure some claims (e.g., Dec/Good Interest) and leave the January claim
hanging out there alone.

I understand your issues with rag-tag but am assuming that the rag-tag
label does not apply to Good Interest.

Thanks,
Bruce

Subject:  Dabhol Power Project -  MSEB and GOM Arbitrations


Bruce,

I think that part of the plan discussed in London has simply been
superceded
by events. In particular,the corporate decision about what the end game and
desired end result are to consist in.

Accordingly,I now look upon the proposed GOM and MSEB arbitrations as
primarily a means of setting up the case for PPA termination in due course.
In the light of this:-

(1) The MSEB arbitration ought now to deal with misdeclaration and claim
payment of the January 2001 billing,as well as the December 2001 billing. I
expect that we shall also put in the subsequent misdeclaration episodes. I
see little value in putting in the older claims (i.e., the arrears and sums
withheld),mainly because Kelly Quinn's analysis of them tends to show that
many of DPC's claims are dud.

(2) There is no longer any useful purpose served in stripping the MSEB
arbitration down to misdeclaration only. Further,not merely I am more
convinced than I was that the MSEB was not entitled to withhold against the
December 2000 billing,but I think that DPC has a 50:50 case that the MSEB
was obliged to pay the January 2001 billing clean.

(3) As I see it,there will be two arbitrations against GOM (the SSA and the
Guarantee) and one against the MSEB. However,if we wish to harass the GOM
and set up further PPA termination grounds,we might well wish to do
something forceful and litigious when (as I confidently predict) the notice
under the escrow agreement is not responded to by the MSEB and the Indian
banks. The notice only really works as and when the Indian banks are
threatened.

Christopher -

Help me to understand the plan for the MSEB and GOM arbitrations for
December, January and Interest.  In how many pieces do we anticipate
submitting these arbitrations?  What strategy is behind the submission of
separate submissions?

I remember that we wanted to separate the MSEB January submission, at one
point, to hasten the disposition of the misdeclaration issue.  Does this
make sense given the events of the last few weeks and the sponsors'
sentiments about additional capital for the project?

Thanks,
Bruce

Jim,

I hope you and Carrin enjoyed your weekend in London and had a good trip back to Houston.

A couple of things:

- I wondered if it was clear yet when General Counsel meetings would be held prior to the conference, and whether those would be in Houston or San Antonio?

- how did Marcus Zwinger impress you? I would like to make him an offer, if you are agreeable.

- we are seeing a sudden increase in metals related arbitration claims. We intend to use two firms to assist with these - both are established shipping / commodities law firms: Holman Fenwick is one, Richards Butler is the other. Please let me know if we have any issues with either of those firms.

Many thanks.

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Bruce,

Herewith the bio(hagio)graphical details of Arthur Marriott QC from the
Debevoise & Plimpton website.

My experiences of Arthur Marriott QC as a presiding arbitrator are good. He
is not a lawyer of the same calibre as Lord Mustill or Andrew Rogers QC (nor
would he,I think,claim to be).  But he is very practical and knows what he
is doing.  He wants to get on with things where he can. He is also quite
adroit at managing tribunals. That is almost certainly going to prove to be
a necessary skill with Kamal Hossain who will see his role as advocating the
GOI's position and engineering whatever delay the GOI wants. I am hopeful
that (eventually) Kamal Hossain will overplay his hand,which will leave
us,in practical terms,with a Rogers-Marriott tribunal.

work is now out of London so I'm not sure of current status.

I believe that one of our Brazil law firms is also a B&M affiliate.  I'm
copying this to John Novak for more input.

I'll look into any others.

In response to your questions:  (1) the GCs will meet in San Antonio beginning on the Wednesay morning of the conference.  There will be no scheduled GC dinner the night before, but those GCs who are in San Antonio that night may get together for an informal one; (2) I enjoyed meeting Marcus; my only question relates to the amount of legal experience he has; as you know, we normally take individuals who have been practicing longer than he has practiced; if you are satisfied that he can do the job well, I will support your recommendation; and (3) I do not have any issues with either of the law firms you mentioned.

Jim,

I hope you and Carrin enjoyed your weekend in London and had a good trip back to Houston.

A couple of things:

- I wondered if it was clear yet when General Counsel meetings would be held prior to the conference, and whether those would be in Houston or San Antonio?

- how did Marcus Zwinger impress you? I would like to make him an offer, if you are agreeable.

- we are seeing a sudden increase in metals related arbitration claims. We intend to use two firms to assist with these - both are established shipping / commodities law firms: Holman Fenwick is one, Richards Butler is the other. Please let me know if we have any issues with either of those firms.

Many thanks.

Subject:	Argentina Stamp Tax

In response to a ""test case"" declaratory judgment lawsuit filed by TGS (with our input) over one year ago, the Supreme Court of Argentina today issued an order enjoining the province of Santa Cruz from enforcing its stamp tax levy pending a full hearing and ruling by the Court on the legality of the stamp tax.  Although this is not a ruling on the merits, it does indicate how the Supreme Court is leaning, at least for the present.  This is a very significant victory for TGS and, if the Court continues in this direction, will result in TGS being relieved of stamp tax liability (approximately $650 million).  A great deal of the credit for this goes to Michelle Blaine, who worked with the TGS lawyers on the filing.  Please call me or Michelle with any questions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

Mike -

While one paragraph states that normal destruction policies are suspended it states in the next paragraph to retain only ones related LJM.  My interpretation is ""preserve anything to do with LJM and if you are unsure preserve anything you think is related to LJM until you can verify"". 

Jim - This is an inquiry from our New York trading office.

Mark,

I'd be grateful if we could have a short conversation today at a convenient time to suit you to discuss:

1. The West LB LC facility. Corp still has not formed a view on whether we can give the ""no material litigation"" rep. so we cannot revert to West LB. Apart from the ?55m potentially available from WLB, Enron Europe now have NO LC facilities available. This is hurting us. Even if the answer is negative, at least we could give WLB a clear answer and negotiate to draw down on the facility.

2. Wrongful trading comfort. The directors having taken independent advice and been told that some fairly low level comfort is needed from Houston, noise and nervousness is now growing at this end because it has not been forthcoming. I attach a draft which would suffice.

 
Can we please talk about how we can get Jeff McMahon to send this to Michael Brown.

3.ICI Counterindemnities and TXU: I discussed these with Jeff Hodge yesterday. Do you need anything more from me on these?   

Thanks


							Mark

Mark, Rob

My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.

Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 

1. Continuing to trade

The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. 

The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  

I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 


2. Filing accounts

The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 

I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 

We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 


That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. 

Many thanks.



								Mark

Hi Jim. Susan Bulgawicz asked for my assistance in the sale of one of the corporate aircraft -- N5737. Since the plane is financed and I have worked on the last 2-3 aircraft deals, there is a logical connection to my involvement. Susan and I both think that the best choice on legal representation is to continue working with the firm that represented Enron in the acquisition and original financing of the aircraft-- Akin Gump, rather than changing horses mid-stream. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

Dear Mr. Derrick:

	Thank you for including me in this venture.  It promises to be fun and
useful.  Unfortunately, in terms of the November 2nd meeting, a faculty
candidate I'm primarily responsible for is coming through the law school
the same day.  He is giving a colloquium late morning/early afternoon and
my wife and I are hosting the dinner for him and his wife that evening.
So, especially given the post-9/11 logistics, it doesn't seem practical for
me to come to Dallas for this meeting.  One possibility might be for me to
participate by phone for a portion of the afternoon meeting and I would be
happy to do so.  But given the nature and length of the meeting, this
probably doesn't make sense - please let me know what you think.

	Best regards.

Hi Jim,

As I mentioned in the elevator last week, we are trying to become more involved with Girls, Inc.  We would love for you and Carrin to sit at the Enron table at their Fifth Annual Luncheon on Tuesday, June 5th.  This event will take place at the George R. Brown Convention Center at 12 p.m.  Please let me know if you're in town.  If you unfortunately can't attend, please let Carrin know that we would be honored for her to join us!  

Regarding SPA, I spoke with Toby Maddox a few weeks ago and he is completely on board with Enron's sponsorship of a performance by David Sedaris, a well-known satirist/author.  We supported this past spring's performance of the National Symphony of Spain at the $10,000 level, so we plan to maintain that level of support for the 2002 David Sedaris performance.  Toby and I discussed having a pre-performance cocktail reception for Enron employees and guests to meet Mr. Sedaris.  Please mark your calendar for April 17, 2002!

As always, I greatly appreciate your input.  I look forward to hearing from you.  
Thank you,

Pat, as we know, February can be a very difficult month from the standpoint
of weather, which affects not only travel to and from the event but also
any outside activities during the event.  Do we have any flexibility with

Jim and Mark, as you know, we have established a retail affiliate within Enron Canada known as Enron Direct.  In addition, EES has a Canadian entity, EES Canada, which was established for the purposes of entering into some cross-border transactions in Canada.  For various reasons, it has been decided to roll Enron Direct into EES Canada reporting, commercially, to Rob Milnthorp, who will in turn report to Dave Delainey.  There are two legal/governance-related issues that I wanted to raise with you:

1.	Governance:  As a result, it will be necessary to make various corporate re-organizations to EES Canada.  This will include having EES Canada established as an Alberta corporation, where Enron Canada has, and Enron Direct will have, its principal Canadian office.  In relation to this, I was considering that EES Canada should be organized consistent with Enron Canada, with two Canadian resident nominee directors and Canadian-resident officers.  A few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related ""permanent establishment"" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada.  Accordingly, Enron Canada was re-organized with a nominee board of directors consisting of Rob Milnthorp (as the senior commercial employee) and me (as the senior legal employee) with a Canadian slate of officers being the Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or commercial-support groups.  I was thinking of doing likewise with EES Canada.  Although I have not yet obtained a copy of the corporate records for EES Canada, I believe the current directors of EES Canada are Jim and an outside lawyer at Blake, Cassels & Graydon in Toronto, Ernest McNee.  I am not sure, but it is also likely that various US-based employees of EES are designated as the officers of EES Canada.  Would it be appropriate to re-organize EES Canada along the same lines that Enron Canada has been organized, or do you have concerns?

2.	Law Firm:  Following-up on our conversation last week, I want to confirm that our continued use of Donahue Ernst & Young for this retail project was ""grandfathered"" on the basis that they were ""up the learning curve"" on a number of the contracting, regulatory, licensing and market participation issues.  There is one twist, however, with respect to EES Canada.  Although I was not involved, I believe that EES Canada was established to execute on some gas transactions in Ontario with the use of a Blakes partner in Toronto, Ernest McNee.  However, as the focus of the business initiative in Canada will, at least in the near future, be more involved and predominantly, if not entirely, in Alberta; and as Donahue Ernst & Young is involved in regulatory proceedings on our behalf with respect to market design issues affecting the Alberta gas and power markets, as well as being familiar with the licensing and contracting requirements for Enron Direct in Alberta; and given my understanding that Blakes' involvement with EES Canada has been relatively limited, I think it would make sense to have Donahue Ernst & Young continue on with this matter.  I am, however, sensitive to Jim's concerns, and therefore wanted your thoughts on the matter.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Peter

Subject:	Re: PEER GROUP MAPPING

Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the ""preferred"" distribution  relative to the bottom category for "" commercial support"" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a ""preferred"" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
       Thanks.

Subject:	PEER GROUP MAPPING

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

As part of the continued cleanup of the production IIS environment on the DMZ I am making some more changes. These changes are meant to secure the production environment and stabilize the server.

All local admin ID's will be disabled ( except for existing service accounts)
All web development persons should access the server with HotTap domain ID's and not local ID's
NO PC Anywhere access will be granted except for server support personnel
Any server changes will need to be made by the Server Support team or HotTap Support team ( ODBC settings, IIS settings, ...etc)

We will make sure that all domain accounts have the permissions needed to function properly. Please let us know ASAP if you need more rights than given and we will correct it immediately.   

We are also working to migrate the SQL services off of X12 by the end of the week. This should help stabilize the server and free up resources.

Thanks for your help and patience.

Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

regards

Ed  

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice. 
NOTE I would really like to complete this by Wednesday this week as this is my last week.

The Corp. design of the iBuyit system is well underway.  We appreciate your initial support of the system and would like to solicit your input on some system details that will be custom to the Corp. deployment and may be used eventually for other business units' standards.  Bob Butts has approved the following request limits for Corp. Accounting, and we need to get your ""OK"" as well for implementation.  Please call me at x33896 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposal.

Request limits:  The system allows setup of graduated dollar limits for order amounts based on job classification, which are listed below, with some examples of items that might fit within each limit.  Requests with totals below these limits would flow through the system without any further authorization required.  Exceptions to these levels can be made on an individual basis, and those individuals will be identified as we get closer to implementation.
	
Level 1	Clerks/Sr. Clerks	$250		Routine office supplies, beverages, pager, computer keyboard
Level 2	Admins/Specialists	$500		Small furniture, larger supply orders, palm pilot
Level 3	Sr. Specialist		$5,00		Computer, fax machine, furniture
Level 4	Manager		$25,000
Level 5	Director/Sr. Director	$100,000
Level 6	Vice President		$250,000
Level 7	Managing Director	$500,000
Level 8	EVP			$1.0M
Please note that these amounts fall within the Enron standards for invoice approval authority.  In our meetings with Stakeholders and Change Agents, we got a clear message that lower ordering authorization was preferable.  

Approval Flow:  The system allows approval flow to be customized to each department.  For example, Public Affairs could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to flow first to an Admin for approval, then to a Sr. Specialist or higher for final issuance.  The Accounting department could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to go directly to a Director for the first level of approval.  Under the limits proposed below, a $650 request by a Sr. Specialist would not be routed, as it would fall under the specified ordering authorized level.  As we get closer to the implementation date, we will work with the designated Stakeholders to design the approval flow for your departments.

Controls:  As with any system, a concentrated effort can bypass built-in controls.  As a control mechanism, we've proposed that SAP generate a periodic report so that cost center owners can conveniently track ordering activity.  The team is working on the best way to generate and deliver this report.

I appreciate your ""OK"" on the above, or any feedback you might have.

Regards,
Elizabeth Linnell

Rex,
 
We  sent up thru Jim's office earlier in the week a bill from the local firm,  Medleh, that has been doing our copying and imaging.  They've told us they  will shut down operations for Enron if they don't get paid.  That will halt  some of our efforts to respond to the SEC subpoena.  Is there some way to  check on where that stands?

Subject:	ENRON EUROPE


Mark, Rob

My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.

Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 

1. Continuing to trade

The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. 

The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  

I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 


2. Filing accounts

The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 

I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 

We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 


That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. 

Many thanks.



								Mark

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office. 
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday.

Jim and Rob,
 
I hope you are both doing well. I realize that you must both be extremely busy with other more important issues but I find myself in a position that I HAVE to raise the issue described in the email below to your direct attention. The email is self explanatory but the bottom line is that not only has Enron failed to make payments that are due to me and to one of my companies for MONTHS now but  the company is not even responding to my requests for information.
 
I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to handle this, i.e WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority to make the payments and give me answers. I stress once more that the unjustified delays by Enron in making these payments is already causing me serious  problems and potential losses.
 
I look forward to your response.
 
Thanks and hope to see you soon.
 
Diomedes.

Mary Joyce,
 
I hope all is well with you. 
 
I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.
 
After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November, maybe even until late November as the ""changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November"". 
 
As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear.
 
These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday, October 24.
 
Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.
 
I look forward to hearing from you,
 
Regards,
 
 
Diomedes Christodoulou.

Dear Sir,

Re: Request for urgent mutual business Transaction

It is a pleasure to introduce myself to you. I am Mr.
Douglas Akin, an Accountant by profession with the
Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation and a member of
the Presidential (Petroleum) Task Force Committee set
by the present democratic Government in Nigeria, to
supervise the sales and award of Crude Oil contracts
through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC).

The Chairman with the entire members of this committee
have concluded every arrangement and now agreed to
transfer out of the country a total sum of $85,
500,000.00 (Eighty five million and Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars Only) to a reliable corporate or
private account oversea for mutual disbursement, hence
my reason to contact you. This amount is the excess
sum realized from sales of Crude Oil above the
government regulated price margin as a result of price
fluctuation, which we never rendered accurate sales
figures to the government for reasons you now know.

Benefits: At the successful conclusion of this
business, your good self shall be entitled to 20% of
the total sum remitted into your account for your
collaboration, 5% shall be set aside to defray all
expenses incurred during the transaction by both
parties and the balance of US$75% for the committee.
If you are interested in this business as I hope you
will, please contact me urgently at any of  the above
e-mail address or fax number, quoting our existing
secret code of this business, as Black & White, then,
I will revert back to you with detailed information.

Note: When dialing our fax, you do not need to add our
country code of 234. Just dial your international
access code, then followed by   our fax number. If you
are in Canada or USA, and outside the area code of
801, then omit 1 but add the 801. You may equally
e-mail us at the above e-mail address.

Yours sincerely,
Signed:
MR. DOUGLAS AKIN,
FOR & ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

Jim:

	A heads-up.  Following up on our conversation last month about Ken Lay's untimely Form 4 filings, it is an item required to be disclosed in our annual Proxy.  As required by the rules, we have so disclosed it under ""Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance"" at page 17 of the draft Proxy distributed to the Board members earlier this week.  Presumably the notation that Ken has since filed the reports will make this a non-event and a mere technical violation, which, based on my review of other proxies, appears to be a common occurrence.    I leave it to you whether you wish to bring the required disclosure to Ken's attention.

	I trust that all is going well otherwise.  I look forward to seeing you at the upcoming Enron Law conference.  I am slotted to speak to the group on Friday.  I may have a problem with joining you for the General Counsel meeting on the 2nd in that I have ""required attendance Lockhart staff meeting"" starting early the next day in Purchase.

                                                                                      Marc

Attached is a copy of our new release announcing the settlement of our
merger (sales?) case. Considering the regulatory environment here and the
good relations we have built with our state commission, we really do
believe we can get final state approval on November 28th!

I am going to unwind a bit and go fishing this weekend, but when I return
on Monday I'll start writing a new resume and begin focusing on my NEXT
career!  If  during your world wide  travels you hear of a challenging
opportunity that seems suitable, please do not hesitate to let me know.
All advice and suggestions  from friends are truly welcome!

Have a good weekend.

Subject:  Niagara Mohawk-National Grid Announce Proposed Merger and Rate
      Plan Settlement Agreement

The following news release was issued at 2 a.m. EDT (7 a.m. BST).  You will
also be receiving a Merger Update on this announcement later this morning.





            Niagara Mohawk?National Grid Merger Joint Proposal
          Expected to Drop Residential Electricity Bills 5 percent

       New York State Department of Public Service Staff, IBEW Local 97,
      Business, Consumer, and Environmental Groups Support Agreement


     SYRACUSE and WESTBOROUGH, Oct. 12 ? Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.'s

residential customers are expected to see a 5 percent electricity bill

decrease under a proposed merger and rate plan settlement agreement

announced by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. (NYSE:NMK) and National Grid

Group plc (NYSE: NGG).  The agreement, reached with the New York State

Department of Public Service staff and other parties, was filed late

Thursday with the New York State Public Service Commission for approval.

If the merger closes, it would result in net customer savings of about $1

billion over the next 10 years, compared with rates projected without the

merger.  Also, as part of the agreement, the companies would expand Niagara

Mohawk's annual Upstate New York economic development efforts by $12.5

million.

     ""Niagara Mohawk's merger with National Grid will allow us to reduce

and stabilize energy delivery costs and enhance our commitment to economic

development in the communities we serve,"" said William F. Edwards, Niagara

Mohawk's senior vice president and chief financial officer.  ""We believe

this agreement will provide significant benefits to Upstate customers and

to the economy.""

     ""The rate cuts, low-income protection, and other benefits agreed to in

this plan will help National Grid fulfill our commitment to become a

positive presence in Upstate New York,"" said Lawrence Reilly, senior vice

president and general counsel for National Grid USA.

     ""The significant size of the merged companies will provide us with the

resources and skills necessary to deliver first-rate customer service while

being a low-cost provider of electricity and natural gas service,"" he said.

He added that the agreement details a comprehensive service quality plan

under which customer safety, reliability, and service will be maintained

and enhanced after the merger.  The plan calls for up to $24 million in

annual penalties ? or more under certain conditions ? if defined customer

service and reliability goals aren't achieved.

     Niagara Mohawk's actual costs for delivery of electricity are expected

to drop by more than 8 percent through the merger.  When those savings are

applied to a customer's entire electricity bill ? which also includes the

cost of electricity purchased ? the net savings are projected to equal 5

percent.

     The reduction would be implemented upon consummation of the merger.

At that time, today's agreement calls for customers' delivery charges to be

immediately reduced by approximately $160 million.  After that decrease,

delivery charges would remain stabilized for

10 years subject to limited adjustments.  In addition, the companies would

forgo collection of approximately $850 million in nuclear costs that

otherwise would have been collected from customers.

     The long-term proposal has a number of other initiatives, including:

?    Price-stabilized electricity commodity service for residential and
small commercial customers for several years, providing those customers
with significant protection from any major fluctuations in the generation
marketplace.
?    The extension by 16 months of a multi-year gas rate settlement,
resulting in gas delivery rates -- unchanged since 1996 -- remaining the
same through December 2004.
?    The extension of the Low-Income Customer Assistance Program, which was
expanded under Niagara Mohawk's existing regulatory agreement with the PSC,
and the development of a special rate for eligible low-income customers.
?    The establishment of electricity choice educational programs targeted
to customers and energy service companies.
?    Environmental benefits such as interconnection assistance for wind
power sources, support for ""green"" power marketing, and the continued sale
of surplus land for preservation.
     The agreement culminates five months of negotiations among Niagara

Mohawk, National Grid, the Department of Public Service staff, and other

parties including large industrial customers,

energy service companies, and various state agencies.

      ""This joint proposal continues the recent downward trend in Niagara

Mohawk's delivery rates for businesses and provides additional rate and

service options for those customers, all of which should enhance business

expansion and economic development across Upstate New York,"" said Robert

Loughney on behalf of Multiple Intervenors, a trade association

representing the interests of the state's largest commercial and industrial

employers.

     The proposed settlement is supported by two major national

environmental groups: the Natural Resources Defense Council, and

Environmental Defense.  It also is supported by the American Wind Energy

Association and by Community Energy, a green power marketing company.

     ""The merger agreement benefits the environment and the economy, by

providing customers with an easy way to purchase renewable energy products

on their electricity bill, and by stimulating a large new investment in

wind energy generation in Upstate New York,"" said David Wooley, counsel for

the four environmental interests.  ""In this proposal, National Grid

demonstrates that it intends to continue Niagara Mohawk's established

record of responsible environmental stewardship.""

     A leading advocacy group for low-income customers also supports the

joint settlement proposal.

     ""Specifically and positively addressed in this proposal are the needs

of many customers who struggle to make ends meet,"" said Ben Wiles, an

attorney for the Public Utility Law Project.  ""The opportunity created by

the merger of National Grid USA and Niagara Mohawk will result in a special

reduced rate for as many as 60,000 eligible low-income customers.  It also

will expand Niagara Mohawk's safety net program to allow more people to

receive assistance.""

     Among the other parties to sign the settlement was the International

Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 97, which represents Niagara

Mohawk's unionized work force.  In addition, the Distributed Generation

Power Coalition, energy marketers, energy services companies, and regional

economic development agencies support the settlement proposal.

     The companies have asked that the matter be considered at the PSC's

Nov. 28 meeting.  The merger also is subject to Securities and Exchange

Commission approval.

     Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. is an investor-owned energy services

company that provides electricity to more than 1.5 million customers across

24,000 square miles of Upstate New York.  The company also delivers natural

gas to more than 540,000 customers over 4,500 square miles of eastern,

central, and northern New York.

     National Grid USA includes local electric companies Massachusetts

Electric, Narragansett Electric, Granite State Electric, Nantucket

Electric, and a substantial transmission business.  Its parent company,

National Grid Group plc, builds, owns, and operates electric and

telecommunications networks around the world.

James,

I am contacting you with a unique offer that will help Enron Corp. reduce
IT/software development and maintenance costs by up to 80% of what your
paying today.  I hope you are the right point of contact as I am writing to
a number of people at your organization in a variety of roles.

We have a large team of the best developers in India, the majority of who
were originally computer science graduates out of the Indian Institute of
Technology (India's premier technology university). These engineers are
experts in both commercial and application software development with
experience implementing industry standard methodologies. We provide
unbeatable rates on quality engineers with a proven track record of success
in J2EE, XML, SOAP and Web Services.

Our rates start at $6/hr for offshore and $19/hr for onsite. We are
committed to 100% satisfaction and guarantee completely the quality of our
work.  There is no catch and there is no risk.

If you do not believe you are the right person to consider this proposal, I
would appreciate it if you could forward it to the appropriate
person/people, as I am certain they will find this offer very attractive.
If you'd prefer not to be considered for this, please let me know.

Again, thank you James, I appreciate your help. If you have any specific
questions, please don't hesitate to call me.

I know that it is impossible to get you on the phone. I have left a couple of messages. I just thought I would let you know how much I feel for you and all of the good Enron folks. You all are in our thoughts and prayers. It does not seem possible that Houston's flagship company and premier corporate citizen could get struck by lightning. If it happens to you all, it could happen to anybody. I have been following the situation daily because I have been representing Tyco in a revision of their existing contract with EESO. It has not been pretty.

As you know, I have twice volunteered our firm's assistance to Enron in anyway we could be of help. I took the lack of response to mean you had all the help you needed. We have been approached by a couple of clients to advise them and to represent them if there appears no solution to Enron's problems short of protection of the bankruptcy court. Do you have an objection to our representation of them? I will assume that you have none if I do not hear from you to the contrary.

We are just trying to ascertain to whom (individual/department/outside counsel) should this mail be directed.  

When we get an answer, we will pass the word and give the mailroom proper instructions.  It is my understanding that many of the officers on 50 also are receiving these letters.  We will need to notify all of the proper procedure.  

Let me know, and we'll take it from there.

Jim and Ben:

As directors of Atlantic Water Trust, Arthur Andersen will request you to sign the AWT management representation letter.   As you might be aware, this year Enron is required to file the AWT 12/31/00 audited financial statements as an attachment to the Enron 10-K, due to the significant write-down of Azurix.     The current deadline of the audit and sign-off on the final AWT financial statements is March 27th.   The deadline is primarily driven by Azurix and the completion of their 10-K.   Therefore I anticipate that the representation letter you will be ask to sign, will not be circulated until later this month.  In the meantime if you have any questions or concerns please call.

Mike Morrison

Jim -- We have been getting a large number of media calls about the 14A filing, which discusses Ken Lay's change of control provision in his contract.  We would like to use the following with media -- and internal meetings with employees:

	Change of control provisions are very common at the CEO level.  Ken has had a change of control provision in his employment contract since 1989.  It enables him to trigger an involuntary termination in the event of a change of control, which includes a merger or consolidation with another corporation and Enron is not the surviving corporation.  This would have gone into effect in the event of a hostile takeover or the announced merger with Dynegy.


Please let me know ASAP if we are able to use this statement.

Thank you.

Subject:	FW: Enron compliance program and summary

I previously mentioned to you that Enron may have to enter into a consent decree with the FCC relating to Enron's failure to file for authorization to transfer FCC licenses held by Portland General Corporation in connection with the 1997 merger.  Before the FCC prepares a draft consent decree they asked that we submit a proposed Compliance Program.  V&E prepared the attached compliance program and summary.  As you can see by the date on the e:mail from Bob Mazer I have had the draft for a couple weeks and have not reviewed it until today.  I have spoken to a couple people in Regulatory Affairs to see if they would be interested in taking ownership of this compliance program.  They don't want it. Sue Nord, who covers EBS for regulatory affairs, is checking with outside counsel used by EBS to see if they agree that we must enter into the consent decree.  I am concerned about Enron's ability to implement this program and want to get your prospective on it.  I am also concerned about whether or not we have other violations that will come to light after we sign the consent decree.  As far as I can tell, at this point Enron doesn't have a centralized system for tracking FCC licenses.  Please let me know what you think the next steps should be for reviewing this compliance program and responding to V&E.

Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

regards

Ed  

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice. 
NOTE I would really like to complete this by Wednesday this week as this is my last week.

Subject: FW: Economic Times article: FIs may take over Enron for $700-800m




FYI, the Economic Times in India has published the following article, which suggests details of a DPC buy-out.  While this article does not accurately reflect the reception Wade Cline has been receiving in Delhi, it may be a trial balloon by the Prime Minister's office to gauge public reaction.  Dow Jones has already carried a shortened version of the story, a copy of which appears at the bottom of this e-mail.  We are using the following statement to respond to media inquiries:

Media Statement 

DPC continues to hold discussions with GoI /IFI's regarding the sale of foreign sponsor equity in the Dabhol project. It would not be appropriate to elaborate further on the recurring media speculation with respect to the status of these buyout discussions. 

While we remain hopeful for an amicable resolution of this issue, DPC continues to pursue the available legal remedies under the contract documents in order to protect the interests of DPC's stakeholders.  


ECONOMIC TIMES, Tuesday, October 30, 2001 

Enron nears deal to sell DPC to IFI's at 30% discount 
IFIs may take over Enron for $700-800m, Shubhrangshu Roy 


US power giant Enron is in advanced stages of negotiations to dispose of its controversial Indian venture Dabhol Power Company at a 30 per cent discount to the financial institutions at a price of $700-800 million. 

Enron and the FIs, led by the Industrial Development Bank of India, are said to be close to finalising a broad agreement to this effect in the next few days. The final settlement should be worked out before Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee leaves for the US in the second week of November. Should the deal go through, Enron is likely to settle for a five-year payment plan in equal instalments to minimise a heavy one-time foreign exchange outgo. Enron claims its financial exposure in DPC is over $1 billion. It had earlier insisted that it be paid this sum for any out-of-court settlement and to enable its exit from India. Now it is likely to settle for a lesser amount, that is in the excess of $700 million, but definitely lower than $800 million, which is its actual equity exposure in DPC. Sources close to the ongoing negotiations say that the government is eager that the FIs take over DPC quickly so that the Prime Minister can tell US President George W Bush during his forthcoming visit to Washington that justice has been done to the power major. 

Enron chairman Kenneth Lay, known to be close to the US President, was the biggest donor to Bush's campaign kitty. A settlement of the Enron imbroglio, being played out since early this year, is seen to be important to enhancing India's political relationship with the US. The government is keen that the FIs take over DPC to avoid prolonged negotiations on a settlement that would be necessary if a private Indian promoter were to step in. So far, BSES and Tata Power have evinced interest in taking over DPC, but their offer prices are said to be too low. The FIs, on the other hand, are keen on an early settlement as they have a huge loan exposure of over Rs 6,200 crore. Should the FIs take over the company, they are expected to warehouse the project before selling it to a private buyer. This is expected to take at least 90 days. 

Any prospective private sector buyer would need at least a month to undertake a proper due diligence of DPC's accounts. Thereafter, the FIs could take at least another 30 days to make an open offer and another month to close the sale with a private bidder or the State-owned National Thermal Power Corporation. 

Sources say of the $1-billion-plus exposure claimed by Enron in DPC, Enron's equity exposure -- along with its US partners GE and Bechtel -- is $800 million. The company also claims to have spent around $200 million as ""development expenditure"" and around $140 million by way of retained earnings.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) is in an advanced stage of negotiations to sell its Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co., at a 30% discount to financial institutions at a price likely between $700 million-$800 million, reports the Economic Times, quoting unnamed sources. 

The business daily says Enron and the financial institutions, led by the Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), are close to finalizing a broad agreement within the next few days. The final settlement should be worked out before Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee leaves for the U.S. in the second week of November, according to the report.

Should the deal go through, Enron is likely to settle for a five-year payment plan in equal instalments to minimize a heavy one-time foreign exchange transfer, says the report. 

Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. Enron holds a 65% stake in DPC. Costing $2.9 billion, the project is the single largest foreign investment in India to date.

===========================================================================
*  Investors appear to have been racing to sell ENE shares because of its
   apparent high P/E multiple (ignoring the considerable value of segments
   including Enron Energy Services, telecom and non-energy wholesale
   services) and misconceptions about a number of issues including its
   stalled asset disposition program (the Portland General Electric sale
   could be significantly delayed), the market position of its Indian power
   plant and California energy issues.  We believe that the current period
   of perceived uncertainly is actually an excellent opportunity to buy
   into a company that we view as virtually unique in the economy.  We
   believe that the energy industry in the United States and world is
   undergoing a major transformation and that a very few companies led by
   Enron are positioned to create efficiencies and provide the products,
   services and flexibility required by customers.  We believe these
   opportunities will lead to growth in earnings of 25% over the long term
   even if telecommunications makes only slow progress and does not come
   close to reaching our expectations.

*  Enron is likely to report strong results in Q1 and 2001 from all core
   businesses.  Although mgmt indicated on its March 23rd conf. call that
   it was 'very comfortable' with  ests of $1.70 to $1.75, we continue to
   be very confident that the company will equal or exceed our $1.80
   estimate.  Wholesale Services is likely to have an 'outstanding quarter'
   according to CEO Jeff Skilling with a 25% to 35% increase in natural gas
   volumes and a doubling of financial volumes.  Retail appears on track to
   achieve its $30 billion of new contract signings and turn profitable in
   2001 on a fully allocated basis.  Telecom has progressed at a slower
   pace than expected by investors as bandwidth trading has turned out to
   be more complicated to implement than some believed and the content
   business (now without Blockbuster as a partner) appears to also be
   developing more slowly than implied by Enron in 2000.  This said, the
   business opportunities in both parts of telecom appear to be excellent.

Sent:	Thursday, November 15, 2001 11:38 AM
To:	Butts, Bob; Derrick Jr., James
Subject:	stock options----application of the conversion ratio to existing options appears incorrect
Importance:	High

Bob--in reviewing the Merger Q & A dated Nov 9 in ""Enron Updates"", I think there has been a typo or a misunderstanding on whoever put together the ""Answers"" about how options will be converted.  

The existing Answer as to how options will be converted is as follows:
	""The number of options will be converted on the same ratio as outstanding shares are converted.  Your number of Enron options will be multiplied by 0.2685 to calculate the number of Dynegy options at close.  At the closing of the merger, the strike price on your Enron options will be divided (sic) by the merger ratio 0.2685 to determine the strike price of the new Dynegy options.""

I believe the strike price should be multiplied by the merger ratio [or at the very least stay the same].  If it is done the way the current ""Answer"" suggests, Enron option holders take a double hit---the shares they have options on are reduced by three quarters and the strike prices [which were already under water] get multiplied by four.  I would guess that application of the current ""Answer""  totally eliminates all existing options, as a practical matter.

I'm pretty sure I am right.  Have the Answer people made a typo or misunderstood how conversion is to take place, or is there a problem with the existing merger agreement that needs to be addressed and corrected?  Please advise.

Subject:	Committee of 12 -- May 1st Luncheon

	I am mindful that our guest speakers are ordinarily involved in the
legal profession in some manner.  Due to the May 1st date falling in the
final days of the legislative session, my efforts to get one of our key
legislators to speak in Houston on that day have been unavailing (all would
be anxious to do so at some later date).
	Consequently, I have tentatively arranged for Malcolm K. Brenner to
join us that day.  Dr. Brenner is a Professor in the  Department of
Pediatrics and Medicine, Section of Hematology-Oncology, at Baylor College
of Medicine.  Among other duties at the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at
Baylor, Texas Children's Hospital and The Methodist Hospital, Dr. Brenner is
the Director of the Shell Center for Gene Therapy at Baylor.  My thought was
that you might find it interesting to hear what Dr. Brenner has to say about
where we  are and where we are going in the field of gene therapy.  He
recently made a similar presentation to our Board of Trustees, and it was
very well received.
	If anyone thinks it undesirable to depart from past practice in this
way, please say so.  Further, I will be happy to have anyone else that you
may suggest join us on May 1st in Dr. Brenner's stead.

	We are close to making a decision on whether to use F&J or some other firm for a new Mariner matter.  I anticipate that if we retain some other firm besides F&J, F&J may want to give us our files back, per the original Gus Blackshear letter to Jim.  Of course, F&J will insist in giving back one of Mark's files under any circumstance.  Put aside for a moment the problematic ethical issue that I believe that raises for F&J and whether we would pursue F&J for taking such an action. If F&J sends our files back, can we live with that in the cases/matters you are handling?  

	For Mark, Jordan and Theresa, I of course already have Theresa's voice-mail regarding the new Mariner matter, and have (along with Jim) spoken with Scott Josie.  I also have an urgent call in for Kelly Zelacovitz.

	If there is anyone else you think I should include in this e-mail, please let me know.

	Please reply ASAP.

Importance:	High
Sensitivity:	Confidential

Ken and Jeff:

Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.

Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.

If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.

I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.

Thanks.

Jim Hughes

Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

regards

Ed  

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice. 
NOTE I would really like to complete this by Wednesday this week as this is my last week.

Hi there, following up from my call earlier...

I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. I know that you are a director of the following companies:

Enron Trading Services Inc
Enron Metals and Commodities Ltd
Enron Metal Brokers Ltd
Enron Metals Far East Ltd

Could I ask that you confirm the following with respect to each company?

Whose signature would be required on any new trading agreement for the company?
Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?

Thanking you very much in advance for your time,

Best Regards

A friend of mine, Jim McCloskey, a Director at Ernst & Young, mentioned to me that one of his partners and former Vice Chairman of E&Y, Bob Herdman, was recently named Chief Accountant to the SEC and asked whether E&Y could be of any assistance with respect to the present SEC inquiry.  I told Jim that I would convey his request to the appropriate personnel.  If you or any one wanted to discuss this matter further with Jim he can be reached at 713-750-8206.

I do know that Jim had met with Jeff Skilling earlier this year to talk about opportunities in E&Y working with Enron and I think he has another meeting scheduled  in November with Rick Causey and others for a follow up presentation, all unrelated to the SEC inquiry.

Dear Mr. Derrick,

I was prompted to contact you because your position as general counsel
gives you such a broad view of all legal aspects at Enron.  You may be able
to point me in the right direction: my firm provides due diligence services
in foreign countries (primarily in Russia and Eastern Europe, China and
Taiwan).  Our due diligence inquiries are motivated by the clients' need to
have full information on the companies and individuals with which they are
dealing abroad.  Often, our due diligence inquiries have a focus on FCPA
issues.  We have assisted clients from the energy industry (Air Liquide,
Chevron, ExxonMobil).

You may be able to refer me to counsel in your department who deal with
such issues, or you may be interested in meeting me.  I will be in Houston
on May 7 and 8.  I could stop by your office for 30 minutes for a brief
presentation.

Gentlemen:

I have watched your success that is reported almost
daily in the news. I have seen your team in action as
competition and possible partner as I've helped
Loudcloud close major outsourcing services
transactions with Ford, Citigroup entities, Network
Appliances and the likes of Estee Lauder and others.
Your team is impressive and so is your mission. I will
shortly end my short tenure at Loudcloud as a deal
lawyer focused on drafting, structuring and
negotiating partner alliance and customer side complex
outsourcing arrangements. Energy, power and bandwidth
issues have and will continue to be central to a
growing and stable econony here and abroad. I would
love to join your team. I would be thrilled to talk to
the appropriate person about an opportunity as a deal
lawyer or as part of your solutions team.

As background (rez attached),
-- I have been a transactional lawyer for about 9
years and am comfortable structuring, negotiating and
closing complex outsourcing, partner and software or
technology related transactions.  Training stints
include Cooley Godward and several private equity
funded entities in the US, Germany and Japan.
-- I thrive on direct P&L responsibility for growing a
business' revenue through straight customer, channel
partner arrangements, multi-party revenue sharing, and
structures that leverage technology, IP and human
resources.  For example, I helped structure and manage
the global licensing program for post mortem Thinking
Machines (aka TM Patents) and when that failed the
litigation tact against Big Blue and SGI.
-- My Japanese language and transactional experience
in Asia and Europe would suit me well to work on
behalf of clients seeking to initate and conclude
relationships abroad.

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.

Gregory Rutchik

Subject:	Career Opportunities at Enron



Dear Mr. Derrick:

     Les LoBaugh suggested that I contact you to inquire about an in-house
counsel position at Enron. I am the General Counsel of Niagara Mohawk Holding's
unregulated subsidiaries, Niagara Mohawk Energy, Inc. and Niagara Mohawk Energy
Marketing, Inc. We expect the sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing to close
in November or December of this year, pending FERC approval, and a sale of
Niagara Mohawk Energy's Distributed Power and Energy Services Business units may
occur contemporaneously with that closing. Therefore, I am now pursuing other
career opportunities.

     I am a good candidate for an in-house counsel position at Enron because of
my 12 years experience as an attorney in the energy industry. As General Counsel
for the Company, I provide legal services and business advise to senior
management and the Board of Directors of both the energy marketing and the
energy services subsidiaries. My experience includes drafting and negotiating
gas and electric retail sales agreements and master agreements and related
documents for wholesale energy trading and marketing transactions, including
physical transactions and financial instruments such as swaps. I monitor and I
am responsible for representing my company in FERC and state regulatory
proceedings. I keep up to date on the fast moving events and trends in the
energy marketing and trading industry by closely monitoring regulatory
proceedings, reading information that is published in trade and related energy
industry publications and my involvement with the National Energy Marketers
Association and the Federal Energy Bar Association. I am also responsible for
representing the company and managing outside counsel in litigation and
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. My experience includes utility
regulatory and legal matters, the transactional work associated with corporate
mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, human resource/employee issues,
interconnection agreements, municipal law, leasing, financing and secured
transaction agreements, commercial contracts, condemnation litigation and real
property matters.

     I have attached my resume for your review. Please contact me at your
earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing from
you soon.

     Thank you for your consideration.

                         Very truly yours,
                         Steven R. Pincus

Subject:	Litigation Counsel Approval - Lakeside Packers

We have a counterparty (Lakeside Packers) who refuses to perform to a 5 year fixed for floating power swap which commenced Jan. 01 and is C$2.5MM (US$1.7MM) in the money to us and booked (we would take a hit to earnings by that amount to unwind the deal).  Unfortunately, without the involvement of Legal, the deal was executed without paper, but on the basis that it was subject to our standard ISDA documentation.  The Confirm was sent out on that basis but not executed by the counterparty.  There was some agreement on guarantee support, but as this was less clear to get the underlying deal put in place, with the approval of Credit, we gave up the requirement for the guarantee in our subsequent discussions and demand letter.

We want to pursue the matter by commencing litigation.

Lakeside is traditionally represented by Blakes.

My suggestion would be to use the Duncan McCachen firm, a litigation boutique who we have used in the past (CIBC litigation).  Mike McCachen has a good understanding of the trading business for a litigation lawyer.  Alternatively, I would suggest Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon who is currently representing us on the NGX litigation and who also has a good understanding of out trading business.  Mike is a little more aggressive than Clarke, to my preference.

We would like to proceed as soon as possible as our demand letter expired last week, and our calls this morning were not dealt with satisfactorily.

Peter.

Given Whalley's promotion, it looks like the Xcelerator will remain under Corporate, rather than moving to EWS as expected when we last spoke.  Given that change, would you like for me to continue to request support from Mark Haedicke's group or is there someone in the corporate area you'd rather I approach.  Whatever route you suggest is fine with me.

Most pressingly, I'd like to discuss our ability to compete with a company with which we've been in discussions -- if possible by the latter part of the week.

Thank you.

My 5 year term as senior partner of Linklaters is very nearly up. Throughout
that term it has given me great pleasure to see our relationship with Enron
steadily strengthen - with a remarkable coverage across our offices.

I have much enjoyed our meetings, and particularly visiting you in Houston
with Stuart Salt, a little time ago.  I very much hope my successor, Anthony
Cann, can similarly get to know you.

It transpires that Anthony will be in Houston next Monday, and I wondered if
you would have a slot (I know this is short notice) to meet Anthony on
Monday.  I have asked Stuart to liaise with you to see if this can be
progressed.

In the meantime, can I send you and your fine company my very best wishes

As a strong admirer of the Enron  legacy, it has been sad for me to watch events unfold over the last month.   Also, I sincerely hope you will be OK personally and in good shape  professionally when all the smoke finally clears.
 
This note is also a reminder that,  with the enormous gatherings of inf0rmation facing your organization in the  coming months -- between investigations, due diligence, and  shareholder suit discovery  -- I am still available to come help with those  needs.  Over and above my self-serving interest in having the work, on a  very personal level I'd like to be able to help out.
 
In case it is needed, another copy  of my resume is attached.  
 
Good luck, Jim, and hang  tough.
 
Steve

Jim,

we are evaluating 3 metals assets acquisition opportunities: 

1. the Longview alumina smelter in Washington State

2. the Vanalco alumina smelter in Washington State

3. an Arco/BP aluminum rolling facility in Kentucky.

I would like to run with one external US firm on these deals (the 3 deals are at exactly the same preliminary stage and there will be some economies of scale to be had. Also consistency of approach is important). The firm also needs to have strong offices with metals expertise both in London and New York and preferably close to the facilities in question. 

The firm I believe can deliver these advantages is Shearman and Sterling. I have spoken to a couple of people in the Houston office about this to get their views.

I would be grateful for your confirmation that you have no objection to this.

Thanks very much Jim.

Hurray!  More good news from Argentina!  Today the Argentine Supreme Court granted TGS an injunction against payment of the stamp tax assessed by the Province of Rio Negro pending resolution of the matter.  Rio Negro recently rejected TGS's final administrative appeal against payment of the tax with penalties and interest in the amount of US $436 million!  Rio Negro had ordered payment by April 26 and threatened to commence collection proceedings.  Recall that 3 weeks ago, the Court also granted TGS an injunction against payment of the tax in Santa Cruz in the amount of US $17 million which was unprecedented.

Dodged another bullet!
Cheers!

It's suggested that we should include (i) dba's, (ii) historical entities to include mergers and dissolutions, and (iii) name changes.

Dear Friends:

May is drawing to an end and we have just completed the moving and
meaningful celebrations of commencement.   A total of 1,468 Liberal Arts
students received their diplomas.  In a few days, you will be able to
experience the ceremony vicariously by reading the remarks of History
Commencement speaker, Admiral Bob Inman, which you will be able to
access at http://www.utexas.edu/cola/news/releases/index.html.

As students enroll in their courses for next year, the prevailing wisdom
seems to be that taking fewer hours will yield higher grades.  In fact,
the opposite is true.  According to a three-year study by the Office of
Admissions, students carrying 15-17 hours outperformed their classmates
taking 12-13 hours.  Nevertheless, the portion of students attempting
14-17 hours is decreasing (from 47.7% in 1996 to about 39% in 1999).
The correlation between 15-17 hour course load and a higher GPA was true
in all racial/ethnic groups and despite differences in academic ability
as measured by the SAT/ACT tests.  This is important information and you
can help by disseminating it widely - especially to current and incoming
students.  The University could serve many more students if students
moved through their college program in a shorter time.  College costs
would diminish and earning capacity would increase.

I have just returned from a wonderful visit to Midland, where Advisory
Council Vice-Chair Brian McLaughlin made sure I saw all that his
hometown has to offer.  We talked with prospective students at the
Trinity School and at Midland High School and Lee High School, had lunch
with fellow Advisory Council member Cadell Liedtke, and even visited the
Haley Library.

Successes abound:  S. Gail Caldwell, American Studies MA and BA alumna,
was just awarded a Pulitzer Prize in the area of Distinguished Criticism
for her ""insightful observations on contemporary life and literature"" in
The Boston Globe.  A cash award of $7,500 accompanies the prize.
Congratulations!

A trumpet fanfare, a classroom takeover, and a Texas-size check -- the
annual surprise Friar Centennial Teaching Fellowship goes to our own
Associate Dean Larry Carver.  The Friar Society is UT Austin's oldest
and most respected honor society, seeking to recognize professors who
reach out to undergraduate students in ways that exemplify true
dedication.  Carver was chosen because ""he reaches students in his
classroom through his tireless efforts to ensure that material is
accessible, interesting and relevant.  He challenges students to revel
in great books.""  With the award comes a check for $12,000. . . which
comes with the condition that the professor cancel class upon receipt of
the check.  Larry assures me that some of the award will be used to
increase the Pinto Carver Scholarship, the only endowment at the
University named for a cat.   See longer story with pictures at
http://www.utexas.edu/cola/news/releases/carver.html.

Philosophy professor Alex Mourelatos has been inducted into the Academy
of Athens, which cited his role in creating at UT a model program, the
joint classics/philosophy graduate program in ancient philosophy which
was launched in 1967.  This is the highest honor bestowed in Greece on
scientists and scholars in the fine arts and letters.

As students prepare for a summer in Winedale learning Shakespeare in the
most hands-on way possible, a new steering committee has been formed to
raise endowment funds to support this program in perpetuity.  Members
are Mike & Penny Cies, Greg & Brenda Hemphill, Royce & Elva Keilers, J.
Mark Metts, Dick and Judy Perkins, Ernie & Mary Gayle Stromberger, Eric
& Laura Thomas, Peyton & Carolyn Townsend, and Barbara & Milt Williams,
who will host the group's meeting at their restored home in Winedale
early in June.   Contact Clare Hudspeth at (512) 471-8861 if you want to
help or make a gift.

For those of you lucky enough to have been taught Shakespeare by James
B. Ayres, Ph.D., Shakespeare at Winedale Regents Professor, you might
want to send him a note of congratulations - ""Doc"" was just elected to
the Academy of Distinguished Teachers at the University of Texas.  The
academy, which totals only 70 members, is intended to recognize and
enhance teaching, especially at the undergraduate level.  Others from
Liberal Arts receiving this high honor are Mia E. Carter, Ph.D.,
Associate Professor in English, and Robert D. King, Ph.D., the Audre and
Bernard Rapoport Regents Chair of Jewish Studies, Department of
Linguistics.  Provost Sheldon Ekland-Olson described these as
""extraordinary teachers.""  He went on to say, ""Being selected is a clear
expression of the high regard colleagues hold for the new members'
dedication and contributions to teaching and to our students'
intellectual development.""

As we talk about great teaching, I'd like to call your attention to an
exciting and important new program here in the College:  UTeach Liberal
Arts, which works with 65 students throughout their undergraduate years
as they pursue majors in English, Spanish, and the social sciences and
get hands-on experience learning to teach in local classrooms at the
same time.  You'll find an interesting article about this program at
http://www.utexas.edu/cola/alumni/initiatives/uteach.html.

Your responses to the questionnaire in the last newsletter were really
heartwarming, with many expressions of appreciation and affirmation.
The great majority wants us to keep the length and frequency of the
mailing as they are and to continue with the same content.  Some great
suggestions came as well: a request for reading lists, more info about
alumni achievements, stories about ""average"" students; and even ideas on
""what alumni can do to be of assistance.""

In closing, let me pose another question: What do you consider the
greatest way in which a liberal arts education has enriched your life?
Send me a line or two on this topic and we may use some of your answers
in our outreach to students.

Thanks for this and for all you do for the College.  Have a happy and
healthy summer!

Hi Jim,

Well, it's been quite a month!  I hope the dust is clearing for you a
little bit, at least.

The results of our email poll of Executive Committee members for our
inaugural meeting are as follows:

a)  Friday, January 11, 2002 -- all can make it except McNamara, Kryder
and (maybe) Green;

b)  Friday, January 18, 2002 -- all can make it except Kryder and
(maybe) Green;

c)  Wednesday, January 23, 2002 -- all can make it except (maybe) Green.

Shall we go ahead and nail down the meeting date and circulate it so the
folks can lock it in on their calendars?  What day do you choose?

Thank you so much for finding the time to manage this matter, as you
have, amid all the other matters on your plate.

David

Gentlemen:

I have watched your success that is reported almost
daily in the news. I have seen your team in action as
competition and possible partner as I've helped
Loudcloud close major outsourcing services
transactions with Ford, Citigroup entities, Network
Appliances and the likes of Estee Lauder and others.
Your team is impressive and so is your mission. I will
shortly end my short tenure at Loudcloud as a deal
lawyer focused on drafting, structuring and
negotiating partner alliance and customer side complex
outsourcing arrangements. Energy, power and bandwidth
issues have and will continue to be central to a
growing and stable econony here and abroad. I would
love to join your team. I would be thrilled to talk to
the appropriate person about an opportunity as a deal
lawyer or as part of your solutions team.

As background (rez attached),
-- I have been a transactional lawyer for about 9
years and am comfortable structuring, negotiating and
closing complex outsourcing, partner and software or
technology related transactions.  Training stints
include Cooley Godward and several private equity
funded entities in the US, Germany and Japan.
-- I thrive on direct P&L responsibility for growing a
business' revenue through straight customer, channel
partner arrangements, multi-party revenue sharing, and
structures that leverage technology, IP and human
resources.  For example, I helped structure and manage
the global licensing program for post mortem Thinking
Machines (aka TM Patents) and when that failed the
litigation tact against Big Blue and SGI.
-- My Japanese language and transactional experience
in Asia and Europe would suit me well to work on
behalf of clients seeking to initate and conclude
relationships abroad.

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.

Gregory Rutchik

	As an aside, from a litigation perspective, A&K did a very good job.  They were responsive in filing the arbitration demand and did a great job applying for and obtaining an injunction against a proposed sale of some of the IHI assets which, in turn, facilitated IHI's coming to the table to negotiate a possible resolution of the matter.

the arbitration proceeding filed with respect to this ena investment (which andrews and kurth filed for us), has been settled quickly in our favor with gail's assistance. this is the matter which we felt would not get actually litigated in the context of selection of counsel and wanted to confirm back this was the case.

Wessex's regulatory lawyer, Chris Bright, has just joined Shearman and Sterling from Clifford Chance.  Until late 1998, he was with Linklaters, Wessex's corporate counsel when it was publicly traded.

Jim, does Enron have a good relationship with Shearman and Sterling?  Though I haven't talked with the Wessex folks, I'm sure Wessex would want to continue using Chris--he is really good.

tragic events in New York and Washington, DC.  The Executive Committee has
put together a great program and set of events, but we understand that
people may want to change their travel plans in response to recent events.

Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

regards

Ed  

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice. 
NOTE I would really like to complete this by Wednesday this week as this is my last week.

I am informed that you are travelling to India for the hearing in the MERC WP. Here's the latest, according to me.
The WP is expected to be listed fairly low down on the cause list (board or docket of the Court) for Monday 11 June 2001. In the normal course, I do not expect it will reach hearing on Monday. The Advocate-General has indicated that MSEB will be ready to go for a hearing on Monday. He said to AMS today that an affidavit of the MSEB will be served tomorrow on DPC (it will be Shobhan's office!). The Division Bench as per the assignment will take admission matters  (and ours is an admission matter) only on Mondays and Tuesdays of the week. Therefore if it appears at 2 p.m., when the Judges will rise for lunch, that the matter is unlikely to reach on Monday / Tuesday next week, an application will be made to the Judges at 2.45 p.m. (when the Court re-assembles after the lunch break) that the DPC WP be placed ""High on Board"" on tuesday so that it reaches hearing on that day. The urgency that will be pointed out is that MERC has kept the matter on 14 June 2001.
It is possible that when such aplication is made (or if the matter has reached int he normal course) that the Court may say that since this matter is likely to take time for hearing, it is better if it is set up for hearing on a day when the cause list of the Court is not inundated with admission work. If this happens, we are relegated to any day Wednesday onwards and it could even be beyond 14 June 2001. Obviously, in that case, if the next date is after 14 June 2001, suitable orders will be sought that the hearing before MERC on 14 June does not proceed.
I hope this clarifies the position here. Please feel free to contact me in case you need any further information.

I'm attaching a copy of Azurix's Request for Arbitration with ICSID in Washington relating to Azurix Buenos Aires.  The claim should be formally registered (i.e., cleared as valid for jurisdicitional purposes) today or early next week.

 

King and Spalding put together a summary of the various themes to emphasize in the arbitration.  Much of it is quotations from provincial officials, in official reports or to the press, demonstrating the political nature of the Province's decisions.  This should give you a flavor of our case.

James

Given Whalley's promotion, it looks like the Xcelerator will remain under Corporate, rather than moving to EWS as expected when we last spoke.  Given that change, would you like for me to continue to request support from Mark Haedicke's group or is there someone in the corporate area you'd rather I approach.  Whatever route you suggest is fine with me.

Most pressingly, I'd like to discuss our ability to compete with a company with which we've been in discussions -- if possible by the latter part of the week.

Thank you.

Dear Mr. Lay, 

My employment with Enron is to be terminated, the reason given by HR, for not meeting performance standards.  However, I firmly believe that this is not the real reason, the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager (Mr. Lowell Bezanis,Manager, EGM) who, I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me.  I have since filed a written complaint to Enron's EEO Committee. 

This committee, having investigated the case, has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings.  As a consequence, my reasonable request for a re-deployment package has been rejected.   

If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job, but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past 8 years.  The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for 30 days.  I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner, unnecessarily, since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife (not only towards myself but also to other employees, some of whom have left as a result) in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions. 

I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability, often receiving compliments from clients.  This cannot be the only way to solve this issue! 

The Trigger and Retaliation.    

Since Mr. Bezanis has been my line manager, internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me.  On August 28, I attended a class of 'natural gas structuring'. Mr. Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs, however, I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge. 

I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms. Shanna Funkhouser (my HR representative).  The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before Ms.Funkhouser.  Mr. Bezanis and Mr. Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered.  Feeling intimidated, I requested that I meet with Ms. Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO, as agreed previously.  She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment.  I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination. Ms. Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following: 

-        the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work 
-        that I was making jobapplications by company email 

Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment. 

As a manager, Mr. Bezanis has: 

-        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals.  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval. 

-        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance (PRC process) which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers' and clients' by review.  Until now, Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results. 

-        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an 'energy index' as a potential useful trading instrument.  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite, but the reaction of Mr. Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first.  I was banned by him from developing the idea further. 

Discrimination. 

It is our belief that Mr. Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees, especially competent women, as equals.  His rough, stifling, and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms. Courtney Campbell, the other only woman reporting to him.   





Hostile Working Environment. 

The working environment under Mr. Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one. Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common. Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence.  We are managed by ""threats"" rather than constructive comments.   

Wrongful Termination. 

Knowing I was unfairly treated, Enron HR has not helped address my concerns.  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process.  Ms. Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair, but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases.  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers, no matter how wrong they are.  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time. 

I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case. 

Yours sincerely, 


Mingcheng Lian

Subject:	In re F&J Representation
Importance:	High


	This follows up on my voice-mail to you of just a few minutes ago.  I reviewed a voice-mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the new Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F&J.  She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions.  Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date.  Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said.

	I see two options:

	1.  If you agree with me that we can't sign the letter as is:  I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today.  If I can't, Mariner retains someone else today.   Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started.

	2.  If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn't budge, we may have to sign the letter as is.

	Caveat:  I don't know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly.  Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys.  

	I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC, this morning what our game plan is, and if it is option one, have her go ahead and contact her back-up choices of law firms, start running conflicts checks, etc., and have them be ready to hit the ground running.

	If there is anyone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know.

	I am in all day today; please let me know what you want me to do.

	Britt

We do not provide copies of the policies.  

The Corporate indemnity is the first line of defense for the D's &O's.  If the indemnity responds, the company seeks reimbursement from the policy up to its limit.   There is no other D&O insurance above the $350,000,000, amount of insurance.

Dear Mr. Derrick:

     Les LoBaugh suggested that I contact you to inquire about an in-house
counsel position at Enron. I am the General Counsel of Niagara Mohawk Holding's
unregulated subsidiaries, Niagara Mohawk Energy, Inc. and Niagara Mohawk Energy
Marketing, Inc. We expect the sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing to close
in November or December of this year, pending FERC approval, and a sale of
Niagara Mohawk Energy's Distributed Power and Energy Services Business units may
occur contemporaneously with that closing. Therefore, I am now pursuing other
career opportunities.

     I am a good candidate for an in-house counsel position at Enron because of
my 12 years experience as an attorney in the energy industry. As General Counsel
for the Company, I provide legal services and business advise to senior
management and the Board of Directors of both the energy marketing and the
energy services subsidiaries. My experience includes drafting and negotiating
gas and electric retail sales agreements and master agreements and related
documents for wholesale energy trading and marketing transactions, including
physical transactions and financial instruments such as swaps. I monitor and I
am responsible for representing my company in FERC and state regulatory
proceedings. I keep up to date on the fast moving events and trends in the
energy marketing and trading industry by closely monitoring regulatory
proceedings, reading information that is published in trade and related energy
industry publications and my involvement with the National Energy Marketers
Association and the Federal Energy Bar Association. I am also responsible for
representing the company and managing outside counsel in litigation and
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. My experience includes utility
regulatory and legal matters, the transactional work associated with corporate
mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, human resource/employee issues,
interconnection agreements, municipal law, leasing, financing and secured
transaction agreements, commercial contracts, condemnation litigation and real
property matters.

     I have attached my resume for your review. Please contact me at your
earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing from
you soon.

     Thank you for your consideration.

                         Very truly yours,

Dad,
After reading and rereading the revised version I have decided to go with
the revised version without making any changes. I belive that it accuratly
sums up the reasons for my academic shorcommings that have plagued my
college years at Ole Miss. I hope that things will work out so that I can
set the record straight and make my family proud. I want to think you again
for being such an anchor in my life. I wish you could come back to Madrid
for a couple of days and hang out. The weather is truly inspiring. Primavera
is here. The sun is shining and the flowers are blooming. When mom was here
we went to the Thyssien and it mad me reminisce about what a wonderful time
I had with you here. I look forward to the next time. I am also very happy
to hear of the positive results stemming from Carrin?s trip to another one
of my favorite recent memories of us together in Scottsdale. Well lets keep
are fingers crossed and if things don?t go our way then I will find a
different avenue inwhich I can succeed. love, Son

Dear  Jim,
 
I have been working  with Tony Jarret (Director, Tax Research) and David Eldridge (IT, Tax  Department) at Enron; learning about Enron and how a knowledge management tool  could help everyone in Enron do their jobs more efficiently.  Presently, we  are very strong in the Legal Vertical due to the overwhelming amount of content  that lawyers deal with on a daily basis.  I have attached 3 documents that  you might find interesting, as they relate to the Legal Vertical.  Should  you have any questions, please contact me at your convenience.  I look  forward to learning more about the Enron Legal Department.

The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

Mr. Derrick,

Our firm has been retained by Enron on a variety of matters over the last few years but we have not yet met.  I will be in your Houston offices on Tuesday, April 17th.  I am writing to ask if you would be available to meet sometime that afternoon.

You may recall meeting my partner, Mike Morgan, in Portland about three to four years ago.  Mike has worked with Enron on the PGE/Sierra deal and other matters as well.

I am the senior partner at our firm who specializes in labor and employment law.  I am a former partner at Littler Mendelson in San Francisco and continue to enjoy a close relationship with that firm.

I have been working with Rick Johnson, Director of Labor and Employment Relations at Enron Corp.  We have been handling the labor issues associated with an energy management agreement--Project Neon.  Rich Freed is lead counsel.  We are working on a project labor agreement in connection with the construction of a power plant--Project Epic.  Randy Pais is overseeing that matter.  We are also working with Marty Keyser on some potential  O & M issues at EFS.

On April 17th, I will be having lunch with Michelle Cash, Sharon Butcher, Kriste Sullivan and Rick.  In the morning I will be meeting with representatives of EFS, EES and EEOS.

My flight on the 17th leaves at about 5:30 pm.  Rick and I would be available to stop by your office sometime after lunch on the 17th.

Please let me know if you are available to meet with us.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Victor Kisch

Jeff / John,

We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals Limited (EML). As you know we have been particularly concerned about watching our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to understand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint. After your review, we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss. If you concur with the actions suggested, please advise.  If there is any balance sheet, debtor/creditor or cash forecast information that you require, please let us know.

Drew Lynch, Kevin Heffron, Jonathan Marsh, and Joe Gold



Introduction

Enron Metals Limited  (EML) maintains a unique position within Enron Corp.  EML is one of Enron's two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA - the UK financial regulator) and Enron's only remaining brokerage business.  Given its special status, EML has responsibilities to its clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the LME (metals exchange) of which it is a member.  As a result of this regulatory oversight, there are several differences between EML and Enron's other businesses:
1)	EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulatory rules relating, among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of business. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in disciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers.

2)	By virtue of its position as an LME broker, there are certain circumstances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients.  EML's policy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible; however, EML's conduct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship to exist.  How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by the FSA and the LME.

3)	Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets and to protect against systemic risk, EML's position as a provider of liquidity and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or lack of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME. As a consequence of this concern, the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as position and credit risk. The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordance with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirement. These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital, which can be used by way of regulatory capital, and a breach of these rules is regarded as extremely serious. An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requirement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to cease carrying on business.

4)	EML's board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory oversight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for a breach of the rules. Penalties for individuals include significant fines and possible expulsion from the industry. The duties owed by board members under the FSA's rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law relating to directors' duties.

Directors Overriding Ring Fencing Obligation

In the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to demonstrate to the FSA that, to the full extent possible, the financial strength of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by the rest of Enron.  In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below.

Issues Surrounding Liquidity

As we are all aware over the past week, as a result of the reputation problems the corporation has been faced with, we have substantially increased the hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML.  This was a precaution against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML.  Clearly the goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to the non-EML related problems of Enron.  This of course needed to be accomplished within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron company as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was concerned  

The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains and distributes its cash.  In the event, that cash is lent outside of EML, it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory capital of the firm; however, the firm has a number of options to preserve its day to day liquidity. 
 
In its position as an LME broker, EML must have access to cash for two purposes.  First, it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House (LCH).  In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collateral to the LCH, it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforcement action could ensue. In addition it would be declared a defaulter and the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions.  Second, it must be able to post margin to its clients.  A failure to make a contractual payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referred to the FSA.  A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-money clients in the event that they wish to close their account.  While there is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market profits, the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation questions.

Previously, we believed there were only a small number of potential scenarios where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity. However certain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from the rest of Enron has become a concern.  EML has or is in the process of losing $60,000,000 of unsecured LC's, which were primarily used in lieu of cash at the LCH.  EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC's.  Additionally, a number of clients have requested that their accounts be transferred.  Those transfers have reduced EML's cash balance.  Was the remaining $50 mm unsecured LC (which has been issued by a single bank) to be withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquidity impact.

The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need for being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality.  Therefore we have agreed to start to do the following
a.	Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquidity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to the rest of the enterprise
b.	Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnel
c.	Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints of continuing to do business on a normal basis
d.	Obtain financial information on a much more timely basis
e.	Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so as to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity
f.	 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additional liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when our own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis

Operational Risk  

In theory, EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own accounts and rely on Enron Corp. for the remaining portion of its day to day cash needs.  EML's board have been resistant to this practice for several very practical reasons.  First, it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly call on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis.  If EML relied on Enron Corp.'s daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs, it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp. or an accounting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either capital or liquidity events as EML's clearing account at Citibank would be substantially overdrawn.  Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event might create a cascade for Enron, EML's board is reluctant to put that much faith in the 100% accuracy of our operational safeguards.

Capital

As noted above, EML is subject to the FSA's regulatory capital rules and must calculate its financial resources on a daily basis.  The FSA requires that EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110% of the minimum financial resources requirement.  For a variety of reasons, there were occasions when EML violated the 110% threshold on occasions in 2001. Because these violations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enforcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintains financial resources in excess of 120% so that it has a sufficient buffer not to trigger the FSA notification requirement. In the current climate the FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might arise from Enron's perceived financial weakness. Accordingly, if one of those violations occurred today, the FSA would likely commence a formal investigation of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in light of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EML's cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily basis, EML's board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital level of 130%.  Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and excess capital adequacy go hand in hand.  

Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress Testing

The stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of scenarios, which would cause liquidity issues for EML

1)	Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or external clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH
2)	Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house account resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH
3)	Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME brokers
4)	Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the inability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in cash being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly 
5)	Credit exposures leading to credit losses

Recommendations

The result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase overall operational liquidity

1)	To fully draw down the remaining $25 mm available under the  $125 mm subordinated facility
2)	To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions (+$20 mm)
3)	To increase the subordinated facility to $175 mm and extend the maturity by six months to July 2002
4)	To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profits and other assets held by EML
5)	To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshold for calling margin
6)	To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients, other than a select group of key relationship clients 
7)	To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading companies (EMCL and EMCC) therefore shifting the need for inventory finance


Current Situation

Unsecured Guaranty			$65 mm
Secured Guaranty			$15 mm
Subordinated Loans			$107 mm
EML Cash Balance:			$59 mm
Cash required to replace
Withdrawn guaranty			($20mm)


EML Regulatory Capital Level:	128%
Excess Reg. Capital over 110%:	$30 mm

Conclusion

The attached financial analysis shows the result of the initial stress testing.
The analysis shows certain low probability sets of circumstances where we would have liquidity issues.  Given these possible eventualities we would urge that we move forward on points noted in bold above in addition to completing point f in the Issues Surrounding Liquidity Section

Jim -- 

We would appreciate your blessing on this revised Q&A for the web.  All of the questions previously of most concern to you have been removed.  We have added in a question about related parties and basically put in the broad FASB parameters.  The Q&A enables us to stick in some fashion to the commitment Ken made on the last analyst call while also removing some low-end calls into public relations from people who have no idea what any of this means.

Hi there, following up from my call earlier...

I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. I know that you are a director of the following companies:

Enron Trading Services Inc
Enron Metals and Commodities Ltd
Enron Metal Brokers Ltd
Enron Metals Far East Ltd

Could I ask that you confirm the following with respect to each company?

Whose signature would be required on any new trading agreement for the company?
Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?

Thanking you very much in advance for your time,

Hi Jim,

As I mentioned in the elevator last week, we are trying to become more involved with Girls, Inc.  We would love for you and Carrin to sit at the Enron table at their Fifth Annual Luncheon on Tuesday, June 5th.  This event will take place at the George R. Brown Convention Center at 12 p.m.  Please let me know if you're in town.  If you unfortunately can't attend, please let Carrin know that we would be honored for her to join us!  

Regarding SPA, I spoke with Toby Maddox a few weeks ago and he is completely on board with Enron's sponsorship of a performance by David Sedaris, a well-known satirist/author.  We supported this past spring's performance of the National Symphony of Spain at the $10,000 level, so we plan to maintain that level of support for the 2002 David Sedaris performance.  Toby and I discussed having a pre-performance cocktail reception for Enron employees and guests to meet Mr. Sedaris.  Please mark your calendar for April 17, 2002!

As always, I greatly appreciate your input.  I look forward to hearing from you.  
Thank you,

Subject:	Termination Roadmap


Please find attached a first draft of the ""Termination Roadmap"" memo setting
out the various options for DPC in relation to the commencement of the
termination process and the choices it faces having initiated the process.
I am circulating this as a preliminary draft to lawyers only in the first
instance, in the knowledge that it probably needs to be refined (and
abbreviated) before it goes to wider circulation.
Please note also that it has been prepared without the benefit of having
seen the Godbole Committee Report (now out and on sale on the streets of
Bombay).
From a commercial point of view, of immediate interest is the analysis in
relation ot the decision on whether or not to complete the construction of
Phase II and whether or not to continue operation of the plant. On both
counts we identify significant risks to DPC of ceasing construction /
operation and we really should consider the overall termination strategy in
the round before decisions on this front are taken, however obvious the
answers may seem to be from a purely financial point of view.
The note is limited to the process under the PPA and coes not consider, for
instance, the influence of Lenders on the process or the role of the LNG
suppliers. It also ignores MetGas. I am happy to expand the note to cover
these aspects, and certainly in relation to the Lenders' position would need
and welcome Lance's collaboration.
Finally, I am also sure that changes will be necessary to take on board the
views of Gail and Christopher in relation to how the arbitration proceedings
would progress in parallel with the termination process. Part of what I have
written is based on discussions with Chris, but he has not yet had an
opportunity to look through the note itself having been preoccupied with
getting Notices of Arbitration out, and I would expect further changes once
he has had an opportunity to do so.

Subject:	Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation


As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Good Afternoon
 
Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.
 
I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

You probably know about this case already, but this was filed this week in Federal Court: 
Pamela Tittle et al. v. Enron Corp. et al. 
11/13/2001-3913 
The description of the facts are: 
Possible class action ERISA violation case in which the defendants failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties to an Enron employee retirement plan by misrepresenting the financial status of hedging agreements made with third party partnerships.
The plaintiff's attorney is Robin Harrison.  I know Robin quite well.  He does not do that much employment work, and is more of a commercial litigator.  As you know, I have done a substantial amount of ERISA work and would be interested in helping Enron out on this case.  Please let me know what we can do to help.

Dabhol and the do nothing Government

By Prem Shankar Jha

Ever since the Vajpayee's Government came to power more than two
and a half years ago, the economy has been sliding relentlessly
into the deepest recession it has ever known. In the nine months
since December industrial growth has averaged 1.7 per cent. The
decade when it averaged 9 per cent and the months, only five
years ago, when it touched 16.2 per cent, are now but a distant
memory. Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September 11
terrorist strikes in the U.S. It has now shrunk dramatically -
vehicle sales dropped by 20 percent in September and colour TV
sets registered a growth of a measly 3 to 4 per cent. With no
demand to power it, inflation, measured by the consumer price
index, has fallen almost to zero. The share market is dead and
there is no fresh investment. Employment in the organised sector
is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human
memory.

In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to
find a place, however humble, in the organised sector of the
economy but been turned away. By 2004, the number will have risen
by another three million. But Mr. Yashwant Sinha is confident
that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of
the country's problems.

But one recent event highlights the government's paralysis more
sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do. This is its
failure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of the
Maharashtra State Electricity Boards's attempt to foil Enron's
bid to take it before an international arbitration court by
claiming that a case was pending before an Indian court
challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase
agreement.

The London Court correctly maintained that just as a government's
international obligations as defined by the Treaty or the
agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law,
proceedings in an international court must take precedence over
those in a domestic court. The way has, therefore, been cleared
for India to face the humiliation of being dragged before an
international tribunal for a breach of it contractual
obligations.

Given the fearsome proficiency of Enron's lawyers, both those
whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase
agreement, it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEB
will lose the case. If that happens, then by a conservative
estimate, India will have to pay around $5 billion, in costs and
damages. In addition it will have to spend a little more to
complete phase II of the project. Thus in the end the project is
likely to cost not $3 billion but more like $5.2 to 5.4 billion.
For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has
dragged on, the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this was
simply a dispute between a State Government and a private
company, and it had no say in the matter. That pretext in any
case wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter-
guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues. But
today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because
neither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable,
let alone willing, to pay such an enormous penalty. So the bill
will, inevitably land at the Centre's door. And that means the
taxpayer's door.

The Centre will have no option but to pay. But having done so,
will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government? The
answer, obviously, is no. What it will be forced to do is
transfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to complete
and operate. But since no one can possibly run a $5 billion power
plant generating 2,100 MW of power profitably, the NTPC too will
insist on the capital value of the project being substantially
written down first. Judging from the offers that the Tata
Electric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply
Company (BSES) were making to Enron, the written down value will
not exceed $2 billion. Thus, whichever way we look at it, the
country will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant ($3
billion) without getting a single watt of electricity or for that
matter anything else) in return.

None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enron
probably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Rao
government agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis. Nor is
it intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government that
had it only brought the Maharashtra government and more
particularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginning
the latter's inability under law to pay backup charges at more
than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants
would have been exposed long ago.

But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify
even greater mistakes in the future. For better or for worse, the
Enron deal was struck, and it was struck not once but twice. As a
serious, responsible government that knows the importance of
honouring one's word in a world where contract is king, the
Vajpayee Government must honour the country's contractual
obligations. This does not in any way preclude its trying to
alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not
see, but by definition all future changes must be by mutual
consent.

The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhol's power
affordable, are known to all. As the 1995 Renegotiating Committee
and the Godbole Committee recommended, the Government should buy
the $800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into a
separate company that can supply gas to all the current and
future users on the west coast. In fact, it could go one better
and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage
the plant. This is entirely feasible because its installed
capacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need. This
will bring down the capital cost, upon which backup charges and
cost per unit of power will be calculated, to $2.2 billion.

Second, the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of the
equity in Dabhol from the promoters. This was negotiated with the
1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so.
This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign
exchange to $1.9 billion and the debt portion whose servicing
represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to $1.2 billion.

The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman
of BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee
debt. That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity
tariffs to changes in the exchange rate. With the price of oil
having fallen (for India) to around $20 a barrel, these changes
will bring down the cost of Dabhol's power at 90 per cent
capacity utilisation own to below Rs. 2.40 a unit. This will make
it entirely viable, especially if Maharashtra and the
neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the
average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and
reduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector.

The right course for the centre even at this late stage will be
to take over the project from the MSEB, renegotiate it with
Enron, or if Enron wants to opt out, then buy the project from it
at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before
handing it over to the NTPC. Getting dragged to court will
neither solve the problem of paying for Dabhol's power nor answer
the more basic question - how can any electricity grid add new
power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it
charges for electricity.

Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

regards

Ed  

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice. 
NOTE I would really like to complete this by Wednesday this week as this is my last week.

If so, we should add wind energy to the construction and development  and information dissemination sections of the recitation.

Subject:	ENS Audit 2001

I understand that due to Enron's problems in America and the fact that that Arthur Andersen are getting involved in a dispute over various audit matters as a result of the bankruptcy there may be difficulties in having Andersen audit ENS for year 2001. While I can see that there may be reservations in accepting the re-appointment of Andersen for ENS I feel that we should consider the implications of finding another auditor at this late stage.

Andersen in Warsaw are well aware of the problems ENS is facing at the present time with regard to power and gas pricing; they are aware of the problems associated with the Settlement Agreement and it's accounting treatment to date. They are familiar with our systems and people. We have also negotiated a significant reduction in fees compared with last year.

New auditors would have to be taken through all the issues from scratch. This would consume time not only from the accounting department but throughout the Company. The audit would take longer and, at this stage, I'm not sure when any new auditors would be able to start given that January is their busiest period. Andersen are available with immediate effect since I have constantly been impressing on them that, given the complexity of ENS problems, we should allow ourselves the maximum amount of time to consider what to put into the report should some problems persist longer than envisaged.

I feel that a change in auditors at this moment in time would be not be in our best interests in view of the above. Also if the ownership of ENS is to be changed it would be beneficial to have audited accounts in double quick time since potential investors will undoubtedly be looking for such statements.

Subject:	Sempra v. Enron

	In September I sent you all a summary of the facts at issue in the above-referenced lawsuit. Since that time, several developments have occurred.  First, the trial date was moved from October 11, 2001 to November 13, 2001.  We have no reason to believe that we will not go to trial on the 13th.  We expect the trial to last from 10 days to 2 weeks. Judge Ira Gammerman will try the case. There is no jury. 
	The second development deals with the proposed summary judgment motions mentioned in my last e-mail.  Summary judgments on liability and damages have been filed and the plaintiffs have responded.  We have filed replies to their opposition papers.  In addition, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to liability.  We filed opposition papers to this motion.  New York practice differs somewhat from Texas practice to the extent that we have no firm date for a hearing on these motions.  Although we are attempting to get a hearing before the trial date, the judge has complete discretion as to whether to hear the parties' motions for summary judgment before the start of trial.
	The third development relates to the plaintiffs' theory of the case. It seems clear from the papers filed in response to our motions for summary judgment that the plaintiffs are fine-tuning their case to focus on the contracts' size distribution requirement arguing that the type of coal supplied by Enron, whether crushed or not, could never meet the contracts' size distribution requirement. The plaintiffs make this argument in simple terms and, when argued as such, it has some appeal. However, it is Enron's position that the contracts' language is ambiguous and the better (and much more complicated) approach advanced by the defendants is that the subject coal could and would have met the size distribution requirements. Issues of whether the contracts are installment contracts also play heavily in this analysis. 
	Fourth, since the last e-mail on this matter, we have learned that the plaintiffs are seeking $71 million in damages from Enron. This is approximately half of the amount of the contracts' damage cap. 
	Lastly, we finally received a response from the plaintiffs to the settlement proposal we made in June. The plaintiffs have offered to resolve this matter for a cash payment by Enron of $45 million. In the alternative, the plaintiffs have proposed a business alternative which is currently being investigated. Additionally, there is some discussion of mediation in the limited time remaining before trial.
	Should you have any questions about this case or should you need any further information, please call me.

regarding information pertaining to the various lawsuits because nothing pertained specifically to me or anyone in my present group.  However, my neighbor who was an enron employee and then a contract employee told me last week that he was contacted by an outside person seeking infomation.  My neighbor developed the model or package that performed calculations on the Chewco partnership.  I asked him if he had told anyone at Enron that he was approached by an outside party and since he was no longer employed there he didn't get the email and had not.  If you would be so kind to tell me who he should contact, he will.  He told me that Enron had been very good to him and he had no intention of discussing this with anyone outside the immediate company.  As an FYI to you, I believe he mentioned that he still had this program on his home computer.

i wanted to summarize where we are on this:

1. the agreement is governed by california law and enforceable in the bankruptcy court. it has a jury trial waiver.
2. it obligates enron corp. and its affiliates. jim please advise if you think that i need to get further approvals for this here or if that has been discussed in the context of asking to be on the committee etc.
3. it lasts generally through the duration of the case even if we resign from the committee. 
4. we are continuing to struggle some with what ethical wall we should obligate ourselves to re trading activities. we are ok with the language re trading in securities and the chinese wall procedures we have in place re those, but it is the commodity trading activities (and tangentially credit derivative activities) that need more thought. mark, i am talking with lance schuler and mark taylor and leboeuf re these and have call into ken raisler at sullivan. i keep thinking that this must have been addressed in the context of a few other cases, but leboeuf and milbank don't think so. dynegy doesn't seem to have thought much about it or the words on the pieces of paper although they now realize they have some of the same issues and we are talking to them. i am hopeful that we will have worked through specific procedures very shortly so that we can come back to you mark with whether you think work and then should be discussed and reviewed commercially.

While one paragraph states that normal destruction policies are suspended it states in the next paragraph to retain only ones related LJM.  My interpretation is ""preserve anything to do with LJM and if you are unsure preserve anything you think is related to LJM until you can verify"".

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers
are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM
partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests
in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to
preserve documents that might be used in the litigation.

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended
immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings,
e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way
relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2,
including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any
transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and
Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a
requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil
and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the
meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with
anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

   RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

   Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have
determined
   to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date.
I
   hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have
already
   made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

   Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
   date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
   <mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of
your
   availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
   originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
   followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

   a) ____________

   b) ____________

   c) ____________

   d) ____________

   After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting
for
   the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members
and
   notify you of the new date.

   Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that
we
   have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
   I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.

I believe that the Resolutions No. 4, 6 and 9 are not correct in terms of the text:

1. resolution no. 4 is not correct since the S.Board did not review the new (attached) changes to the budget and did not approve it. There was also an amandement to the text of the Resolution re. the line items and the total amounts exeeding the approved budget.	

I believe that the draft Budget with the new amendemends must be reviewed once again as a whole at the next Sup.Board meeting before it can be enacted.

2. Resoltuions No. 6 and 9 - the vote descritpion is not correct

The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

I have discussed this with Jacek.  The reason for increasing Jacek's package is retention.

Jim, I promised you some contact details.

Although I'm a little late with formal notification, as from the beginning of
the year I joined Societe Generale on a part-time basis.  I'm a Senior
International Adviser which means I do pretty much anything I want to turn my
hand to.  Jay Worenklein, who's the Global Head of Project Finance in New York,
is an old friend and we have always said that it would be fun to work together
if the opportunity ever arose.

In parallel with the SG role, I am continuing with the two roles for the British
Government I had previously mentioned to you: as adviser to the Deputy Prime
Minister and the Minister of Transport on the use of private finance in the
transport sector, and as non-executive Deputy Chairman of Partnerships UK, the
new merchant bank cum project developer the Government has formed to take
forward its well-known private finance programme.  So you can see that I've
finally ended up with the sort of portfolio we were discussing last fall.

Contact details are as follows:

Mobile              44 7802 655 605

At Partnerships UK  44 20 7273 8341 (direct)
               44 20 7273 8357 (my personal secretary - Carole James- who can
usually be relied upon to know where I am)
               44 20 7273 8383 (switch)
               44 20 7273 8367     (fax)
               e-mail:  adrian.montague@partnershipsuk.org.uk

At Societe Generale 44 20 7676 6821 (direct)
               44 20 7676 6881 (Nicola White - who tends to now where I am when
I'm at SG, or is a good point of call if Carole is not there)
               44 30 7676 6000 (switch)
               44 20 7667 2487 (fax)
               e-mail: as above

Since I move between offices a fair amount, if you send an e-mail, it's best to
send to both addressed at once.

All the best

Adrian

Dear Jim: I received a subpoena in TODAY's US Mail in Fred Greenberg v. various Enron Directors. I was directed to appear and bring various documents at the offices of Esquire Deposition Services, Houston, Texas on November 23, 2001.  It indicated that I was subpoenaed on a representative of ES Power 3 LLC. 
I officially retired from Enron on April 1, 2001. I have no understanding that I had any direct relationship with ES Power 3 LLC. I retained no records of the company and have no idea why I am being subpoenaed. 
Would you kindly advise me in a timely manner if I have any obligation to respond?  
The subpoena was mailed to me care of Enron in Houston and apparently forwarded to me in an envelope which arrived TODAY. 
Kindly advise me how I am expected to proceed.

Hi Jim.  I hope all is well.  I am hoping to get your consent to hire an attorney to assist me in our European efforts.  Her name is Julia Friebel.  She has excellent experience and has been through the interview process with my colleagues in Enron Europe Legal, as well as me and all of our senior managers in Germany.  She will be based in our Germany office.  Everyone who has interviewed her has proposed that we hire her.  I will fax you her resume.  I believe she will be a real asset to our team.  She has no current plans to travel to the US, so I would like to hire her prior to her having the opportunity to meet with you.  Please let me know.  Thanks, Jim.

Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

regards

Ed  

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice. 
NOTE I would really like to complete this by Wednesday this week as this is my last week.

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office. 
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday. 
If this is not the proper protocol, I would appreciate hearing from you.

We do not provide copies of the policies.  

The Corporate indemnity is the first line of defense for the D's &O's.  If the indemnity responds, the company seeks reimbursement from the policy up to its limit.   There is no other D&O insurance above the $350,000,000, amount of insurance.

Please advise if there are further questions.

Kate and Larry,

	Limor Nissan in the New York office needs a copy of the Director and Officer Liability policy (or a similarily named document) for review.  Jean Michaud, a Canadian director, wants confirmation of coverage before signing documents.  Limor needs this information as quickly as possible.

Many thanks,

Subject:	Age Discrimination in Employment Act Directed Charge of 3/8/01

Mr. Derrick, I am sending this email to you at the request of Mr. James Bouillion.  I understand you are already aware of the above as a copy of the EEOC charge was provided to you by Ms. Michelle Hoogendam Cash, and as Mr. Bouillion wrote to you regarding same on May 10, 2001 when he first learned about it from Ms. Cash.

Mr. Bouillion has consulted with our broker, and it is their recommendation that we formally place our carrier on ""notice"" of a ""potential claim"" situation as a ""precautionary measure"" to ensure that the reporting provisions of the insurance contract are met.  While the charge itself does not give rise to a ""claim"" under the policy, the broker feels that matters which involve the EEOC generally result in formal claims being pursued.  Thus, their recommendation to report to the carrier.

Please advise if you would like for us to formally report this matter to the broker so that they can notice our carrier.  If so, please let us know whether you want us to disclose to Ms. Cash the potential for insurance coverage in the event a claim(s) result from the allegations.  Thanks,

It is my understanding that:
After taking into account the recent preferred with Dynegy, Enron has limited authorized shares for further private equity; 
A shareholders meeting is necessary to authorize additional shares; and
A shareholders meeting requires a 30-day notice period.

In order to be safe, I think we need an additional 250 million authorized shares - in order to comfortably raise up to $2.0+ billion - although the first tranche will likely be $800 to $900 million.

Who is the right person to take the lead in this matter?

On Thursday November 9, Judge Richard Aikens of the High Court in London heard oral arguments from the parties' counsel as to whether he should grant Reliance's application to appeal certain points decided by the arbitrators in the partial awards rendered in the case of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. vs. Reliance and ONGC.

On Friday November 10, the judge issued a letter denying Reliance's application, with a statement to the effect that he would issue a formal order with reasons at a later date.

The judge has now given Reliance (and ONGC) a deadline of November 19 to submit to him (if they so choose) a justification as to whether he should allow them to appeal his decision to the English Court of Appeal.

By copy of this note I request Mike Smalling to forward to Larry, Rick, and Radha a copy of the judge's letter of November 10.

Subject: Questions from New York Times



Paula -- we've received written questions from the New York Times for a weekend story.  I need your assistance on the following:

Why, in securities filings this year, did Enron describe its principal business as ""security brokers, dealers & flotation"" when before it had said it was in the business of ""wholesale-petroleum & petroleum products""?

Has the board taken any action in regard to the events of the past week? 

Have they called any special meetings?  formed any special committee? 

Have they hired an attorney to review the situation? 

I know you have several meetings today, but when you get a chance, would you give me a call or email me? 

Thanks, Paula!

Subject:	Dabhol Power Project - Notice of Arbitration (GOM/SSA)

I attach a more developed (if longer) version of the proposed Notice of
Arbitration.

I would be grateful if Paul Kraske and his team could assist Andrew House in
verifying the facts, dates or events etc. indicated in the text.

Assuming that the PFM notice is served tomorrow, I should be grateful if a
copy could be sent at that time to the GOM demanding written confirmation of
the immediate cessation of all adverse activities complained of in the PFM,
the confirmation to reach DPC by 12:00 hours 1ST on 9th April 2001 (failing
which an arbitration will be commenced immediately against the GOM). My
point is this no such confirmation will be forthcoming, and even if it were
we would go ahead anyway. For formalistic purposes I simply wish to
crystallise in written form the existence of the disputes as between DPC and
the GOM.

We next need a 60-day notice under Clause 17.4(d) of the PPA.

Chuck:

Wanted to pass along my appreciation to you for considering Ad Hoc Legal
Resources in filling Britt Davis' recent need for a temporary paralegal.
 As you probably know, our employee, Barbara O'Banion, started in the
position earlier this week.  I will be calling Britt soon to check on
Barbara's progress.

On a separate note, I want to offer you our services as you and your legal
team strategize your defense of the recent shareholder suits.  Ad Hoc has
been an integral component in staffing complex, multi-party litigation for
companies of your size -- we have supplied as many as 90 temps on a single
piece of litigation.  We have considerable experience designing and
recruiting flexible, cost-efficient teams of knowledgeable legal
professionals who can handle the routine aspects of a document review,
while your permanent staff works on more sophisticated matters.  Likewise,
as your transactional counterparts at Enron begin working on the merger's
due diligence review, I hope Ad Hoc can offer its experience.  We supplied
the largest number of temporary lawyers and paralegals to conduct document
reviews in both the El Paso/Coastal and Exxon/Mobil mergers.  We were also
involved in the Chevron/Texaco merger and the Waste Management buyout.

Please do not hesitate to call on me at any time if I can be of assistance.
 Again, thank you for confidence in our services.

Best regards,


Beth Moore

Subject:	Organization Changes

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

Dear General Counsels:

On Monday, May 21, 2001, our two summer associates, Chike Okpara and Reginald Sewell will begin their summer rotation program with Enron.

As you know, both of these gentlemen have just completed their first year of law school at the University of Texas School of Law.

Our summer program is for twelve-thirteen weeks beginning on May 21, 2001 and ending on August 17, 2001.  Since school begins on August 20, 2001, I anticipate that each student may wish to end his rotation during the week of August 13, 2001, thus leaving time for a brief vacation to be taken before school starts. 

Mr. Okpara's rotations are:

	May 21, 2001 through June 15, 2001		Corp. Legal/ETS Legal Dept.
	
	June 18, 2001 through July 13, 2001		Enron Global Finance Legal Dept.

	July 16, 2001 through August 17, 2001		Enron Wholesale Services Legal Dept.

Mr. Sewell's rotations are:

	May 21, 2001 through June 15, 2001		Enron Global Finance Legal Dept.

	June 18, 2001 through July 13, 2001		Enron Broadband Services Legal Dept.

	July 16, 2001 through August 17, 2001		Enron Energy Services Legal Dept.

Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell will attend New Hire Orientation on Monday, May 21, 2001.  I will be at New Hire Orientation to meet and greet them.  I will also present the Enron Code of Ethics.  New Hire Orientation ends at noon.  Following New Hire Orientation, I will take Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell to lunch.  I anticipate introducing them to their first respective rotations at 2:00 pm on Monday, May 21, 2001.

I have sent their resumes to you under separate cover.

Thanks so much for your participation in this program.

Please call me at 713-853-7224 if you have any questions.

Thank you.

Sharon

Subject:	IGL Claim 

Attached please find an electronic copy of a memorandum that I prepared this week in connection with the claim by International Gas Limited (""IGL"") against Enron Exploration Company (""EEC"").  The claim appears to relate to the recent execution of an upstream gas development ""Term Sheet"" in connection with Project Dolphin, and certain rights IGL believes it has to participate in the benefits of such Term Sheet pursuant to a May 18, 1994 Agreement that was executed between IGL and EEC in connection with Enron's earlier Qatar LNG Project.

I understand from discussions the other day with Bob Williams and Don Wendland of EOG Resources Inc. (""EOG"") that EOG will in all likelihood ask Pettman Smith (IGL's counsel in London) for an extension of the requested April 16 response date.

If you have any questions or comments on this memorandum, or if I can be of further assistance in connection with this claim, please do not hesitate to call on me.

Jim,

I have been asked by the management of Mariner to seek your approval of
Mariner's retention of John E. Graykowski, a partner at Dyer Ellis & Joseph
in D.C., for an upcoming project finance matter.  Until recently, John was
the Deputy Maritime Administrator (MARAD)responsible for implementing the
National Shipbuilding Initiative, with particular emphasis on the Title XI
Loan Guarantee Program. The project Mariner wants to utilize John for is the
potential financing, through bonds guaranteed by MARAD, of the construction
of a $50-60MM portable deepwater production facility. Given his ties with
MARAD, John is uniquely qualified for this project, but I want to make sure
you have no conflict issues or other concerns with John or his firm.

If you would like more information on John or Dyer Ellis, or you have any
other questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

I look forward to hearing from you.


Regards,
Kelly Zelikovitz

Good Afternoon

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

regards

Ed  

Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice. 
NOTE I would really like to complete this by Wednesday this week as this is my last week.

I know it seems like a long time ago but....Do you have a clear recollection of whether Dick Foster was in attendance at the Exec. Session of the Audit and Compliance Comm. on Monday., Oct. 8 at 7:45 p.m. at the Four Seasons when Joe Dilg reported?  I feel like my notes and recollection are accurate, but wanted to cross-check with you.  Thank you.  

Separately, I talked to Joe today.  For some reason, he did not receive the notice about yesterday's Audit Comm. mtg. personally.  He is awared of the related issues and will join us on Sunday.

Jim -

I'm attaching an e-mail from Chris Walker and a letter from Arthur
Marriott.

Arthur has been invited by the 2 existing arbitrators to act as the third
arbitrator in the existing GOI Guarantee arbitration.  Christopher supports
Arthur's participation.

However, Arthur and his firm have some Enron involvement.  First, he
represents Shell on the Cuiba project.  Second, some of Arthur's partners
(and not Arthur) have been advising some of the Indian lenders on aspects
of NY law.  Neither of these representations particularly bother
Christopher but he wants to make sure that it does not bother Enron.

Can you let me know today if you believe that these issues present a
problem for Arthur acting as the 3rd arbitrator?

Thanks,
Bruce

Pursuant to the subject audit, AA has received copies of Policies F (""Selection and Retention of Outside Counsel"") and Q (""Claims, Litigation and Related Proceedings"") and related exhibits from the Enron Legal Department Policy Binder which was distributed in November 1994. While these policies appear to me to remain applicable and to be consistent with statements in the Enron Code of Ethics, AA was under the impression that either these particular legal department policies or the binder itself have been more recently reissued.

I am not aware of any later editions of the particular policies or the binder. Are either of you?

Eric Gonzales will be moving back to Houston and working full time co-heading the Global LNG group as of April 20.  The LNG market looks very promising and the team has already done a number of spot cargoes.   
With that evolution we will make the following changes:  the Spanish team headed by Mariano Gentilini, will now report to Eric Shaw who will then have origination responsibilities for the entire origination and asset development efforts on the European Continent.  The Spanish energy markets are becoming increasingly integrated into the neighbouring continental energy markets, with significant cross border opportunities and we expect these changes to help us maximise our information sharing and cross-border opportunities.
The Arcos power station development effort has made significant progress over the past few years under Eric Gonzales's leadership.  We are entering the final permitting stage, and we expect to begin construction by the end of this year.  We would like to thank Eric for his contribution over the past three years, and we are confident that the strong team he has built will successfully complete this critical project.  In addition to his Country Head responsibilities for Spain and Portugal, Mariano will continue to lead the Arcos development effort.

We are asking this foundation for $5,000 support of   our education and outreach programs (deadline Nov. 1) and I'm  slipping in information regarding our Allison relief needs though not asking for  specific help at this point.

Do you know any of these trustees and could you  send a support note on our behalf?

Hi Jim,

Well, it's been quite a month!  I hope the dust is clearing for you a
little bit, at least.

The results of our email poll of Executive Committee members for our
inaugural meeting are as follows:

a)  Friday, January 11, 2002 -- all can make it except McNamara, Kryder
and (maybe) Green;

b)  Friday, January 18, 2002 -- all can make it except Kryder and
(maybe) Green;

c)  Wednesday, January 23, 2002 -- all can make it except (maybe) Green.

Shall we go ahead and nail down the meeting date and circulate it so the
folks can lock it in on their calendars?  What day do you choose?

Thank you so much for finding the time to manage this matter, as you
have, amid all the other matters on your plate.

David

I just got back from San Francisco.  We are delighted you will be joining us.  It will be a fun night.

We are hiring limos to take us to and from the Shrine Auditorium.  Because both John Quinn and I live in Pasadena, the limos will be picking us up and dropping us off there.  Also, we are likely to have a dinner following the awards ceremony in Pasadena.  So--my recommendation would be for you to stay at the Ritz Carlton in Pasadena.

Your voice message said that you have not finalized travel plans yet.  If you get out in time for dinner on Saturday, we should get together.  As soon as you have your reservations, give me a call or e-mail me.  My direct dial at work is 213-533-8667.  My cell phone is 818-519-8751.  Mary's cell is 818-519-8750.

I think it would be productive for you to spend some time with us on Monday morning.  know the people working on your matters would like to meet you.  Perhaps I could pick you up on the way to work on Monday.

   Hi Jim--

   The last month or so have been so hectic I have barely had time to
   breath.  We have gone from fire to fire.  Over the last 24 hours (since
   we submitted our last hurry up brief) I have been reflecting on the
   experience.  To say it has been positive is an understatement.

   Under ordinary circumstances working under such continual pressure--with
   so much $ on the line--would have been stressful.  However, when you
   work with Enron the opposite is true.  There is such a sense of esprit
   d' corp that permeates your organization.  It makes difficult things
   easy and the impossible, just another day in the office.

   There are no egos to trip over at Enron.  When there is a problem to
   solve, it is everyone's problem.  People are not afraid of asking
   questions.  They keep questioning until they understand.  Nobody minds
   repeating themselves.  They are incredibly patient with outside
   lawyers--spending hours and hours bringing us up to speed.  As you well
   know, yours is not a simple business.  It is so refreshing.

   There are so many benefits to this team approach.

   1.  You get things right the first time.  As you know, in any litigation
   is critical that the court view your side as the teller of truth.
   Because you get things right the first time,  the company is not exposed
   to being discredited when the other side responds.

   2.  I would bet that Enron's outside legal bills are half what they
   would be otherwise.  With most companies the outside (and inside)
   lawyers get a minimum of support from the business people.  The business
   people view business as business and lawsuits as an annoyance.  (I
   should say that I could never understand that given the direct  Perhaps
   it is the trader mentality at the company.  Perhaps it is an unwavering
   focus on the bottom line.  Perhaps it is just that everyone feels they
   are a part of a team and they realize that by working together the team
   can achieve things that no one person can do working alone.  Whatever
   the reason, the outside lawyer's job is made so much easier.  That
   results in much, much lower legal bills.

   3. You increase your chances of winning.  The brainstorming is so
   valuable.

   4. The outside lawyers, like me, feel they are part of the team.
   Outside lawyers do not feel as if they are on trial.  They can ask the
   dumb questions.  I know that all of us here are looking forward to the
   next opportunity to work with the Enron team.

   5.  Human nature being what it is--I think that when there are choices
   to be made as to whose work goes on the top of the pile--the Enron
   assignment goes to the top more often than not.

   You have built a great legal team.  All of your legal staff should be
   proud of what they have built.


   Thanks for letting us come along for the ride.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

I am planning to be in Houston later this month when two of my Moscow-based

Production Sharing conference. Once being in Houston, I would very much like
to pay you a visit, remembering the invitatiuon you kindly extended to me
when visiting our offices a couple of years ago. Of course, I would also
like to introduce to you Bruce and Ivan, both of whom do work in the energy
field and in other areas Enron is active in.

We expect to arrive in Houston in the afternoon of Tuesday May 29 and depart
in the afternoon of Thursday May 31. It would be great if you we were to
have some time for us, and I would appreciate it very much if you could send
me a brief email and let me know whether a meeting with you might work out.

Independently, I will also try to contact Mark Haedicke so as to see whether
I could se him again, too.

The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

Subject:	Tenancy dispute - approval for engaging external counsel

Jim

I am managing a dispute here in Singapore involving the tenancy of one of our expats (John Chismar). Essentially, there was an agreement for an early termination on 31 May 2001, but the Landlord is now seeking to ""rescind"" the early termination agreement on grounds that we have allegedly prevented his contractors from inspecting the premises thereby breaching a condition of  termination agreement. 

I am of the view that the allegations are without merit but there is significant acrimony with the Landlord and all attempts at reasoning with him have failed. John Chismar is of course adamant about moving out and has in fact agreed to a new lease of different premises. The Landlord (who is an ex-lawyer) is likely to be uncooperative when we try to hand over at the end of the month and withhold the deposit of S$42,750 (approx. US$24,000) and try to sue for rent.

In anticipation of litigation, I would like to instruct external counsel to help me manage this matter. I took the liberty to mention this to John C and he is agreeable to the course of action.

I would like to propose Hri Kumar of Drew & Napier whom I have worked with and instructed for similar matters in my previous employment. Drew & Napier is a prominent law firm in Singapore (especially for litigation). They have a joint venture with Freshfields of the UK which operate here in Singapore as Freshfields Drew & Napier dealing with high end corporate work. However, I note that Drew & Napier is not on our approved list of external counsel and write for your approval that I instruct them for this matter.

Subject:	UT - Summer Clerks at Enron

Dear Jim:

Mr. Chike Okpara and Mr. Reginald Sewell have enthusiastically accepted our offer to work at Enron as Summer Associates/Clerks during Summer 2001.

The Term begins on or about May 14, 2001, and ends on or about August 17, 2001.  Both gentlemen indicated that they might need a few days after school ends on May 11, 2001 and begins again on August 20, 2001.  We indicated that we have some flexibility with respect to the start date and we are waiting to receive information from Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell with respect to the dates.

As per our initial discussions, it is my understanding that Enron would like the students to rotate through Enron Broadband Services, Enron Energy Services, and Enron Wholesale Services.  Do you want me to include Enron Global Finance, Enron Transportation Services and Enron Corp. in their rotations?

Depending upon the number of Enron entities participating in the rotations, each student will spend approximately 2-3 weeks in each business unit, if there are five business units.  In the event we only have three business units, each student will spend approximately 4 weeks in each area. 

I will make sure that Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell receive a personal introduction to Enron via our orientation process.  Further, I will participate on a weekly basis as a mentor and liaison with each student.  In addition, should we need assignments from Corporate Legal, I will be happy to coordinate the same.

During our program, I envision their duties as follows:

	1.  Provide legal research assistance, including the preparation of legal memorandum and other documents, 
	on various issues;

	2.  Attend meetings and conference calls as required by their respective assignments; and 

	3.  Undertake other legal duties as required by the respective law departments.

I have also spoken to Lisa Falick, Attorney Recruitment Coordinator at Vinson & Elkins.  She will forward to me the Summer Associate/Clerk activities list upon its completion.  

Please advise if you would like for me to take any additional steps.  

Thank you.

Sharon

Jim - The presentation from GS and V&E was still preliminary on Friday, and Andy had also not yet seen the proposed presentation.  As such, I did not review it with Ken.  (Plus, the Agenda Review was fairly long.)  Andy set up a review session with GS and V&E for 8:30 Monday morning - let's look at it then and decide how best to brief Ken, or if we feel it is still necessary to do so based on your and Andy's previous communications with Ken.   

FYI,  GS and V&E have prepared a 20 minute joint presentation, but it will likely take longer with Q&A.  GS will present a merger market overview, a discussion of vulnerability and a discussion of defenses.  V&E willl address defenses in place as well as other possible defenses.

Paula -- we've received written questions from the New York Times for a weekend story.  I need your assistance on the following:

Why, in securities filings this year, did Enron describe its principal business as ""security brokers, dealers & flotation"" when before it had said it was in the business of ""wholesale-petroleum & petroleum products""?

Has the board taken any action in regard to the events of the past week? 

Have they called any special meetings?  formed any special committee? 

Have they hired an attorney to review the situation? 

I know you have several meetings today, but when you get a chance, would you give me a call or email me?

Hi Jim,

As I mentioned in the elevator last week, we are trying to become more involved with Girls, Inc.  We would love for you and Carrin to sit at the Enron table at their Fifth Annual Luncheon on Tuesday, June 5th.  This event will take place at the George R. Brown Convention Center at 12 p.m.  Please let me know if you're in town.  If you unfortunately can't attend, please let Carrin know that we would be honored for her to join us!  

Regarding SPA, I spoke with Toby Maddox a few weeks ago and he is completely on board with Enron's sponsorship of a performance by David Sedaris, a well-known satirist/author.  We supported this past spring's performance of the National Symphony of Spain at the $10,000 level, so we plan to maintain that level of support for the 2002 David Sedaris performance.  Toby and I discussed having a pre-performance cocktail reception for Enron employees and guests to meet Mr. Sedaris.  Please mark your calendar for April 17, 2002!

As always, I greatly appreciate your input.  I look forward to hearing from you.  
Thank you,

VINSON & ELKINS LABOR & EMPLOYMENT E-LERT
___________________________________________________________
Disregarding some federal cases to the contrary, the Supreme Court of Texas
has held that the correct standard of causation applicable in all TCHRA
discrimination cases is the ""motivating factor"" standard.  Accordingly, the
Court found that the trial court erred by refusing to give a ""motivating
factor"" instruction in this pretext case.  Prior federal court decisions
addressing Title VII ""pretext"" cases had required a plaintiff to demonstrate
that the protected characteristic was a ""determining factor"" in the decision
at issue. These federal cases indicated that the ""motivating factor""
standard was applicable only to ""mixed motive cases"" in which the plaintiff
had direct evidence of discrimination.

Also troubling for Texas employers is the Court's secondary holding
regarding the plaintiff's evidence of age discrimination.  The company
terminated the plaintiff's employment for documented poor performance.
Because the plaintiff offered anecdotal evidence from co-workers suggesting
that he was a good performer, the court determined that he had produced
sufficient evidence of pretext to get to the jury, citing Reeves v.
Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc., 120 S.Ct. 2097 (2000).  As suggested by the
dissenting judges, this holding could mean that a plaintiff can avoid
summary judgment in a poor performance case by producing some evidence of
positive performance feedback

Mark -

SK Enron is part of EGAS.

It is my understanding that there were more than 15 expressions of interest in acquiring our interest in SK Enron.  Accordingly, there will be a number of firms that will be representing potential buyers.  I don't think that we have a problem with Clifford Chance representing a potential buyer.  We have not used CC in connection with this investment.

Bill, I've never heard CC's name come up in connection with SK Enron (e.g., representing a seller in SK Enron's purchase of a smaller LDC) but would appreciate your confirmation as well.

Thanks,
Bruce

	Subject:	2002 Corporate Allocations to EIM


	Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

	The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

Jim,

Well, you finally gave a speech that topped the one you gave at Linda's and my rehearsal dinner.  You did an outstanding job (as did Carrin), and it was obvious you were speaking from the heart.  I know you would prefer not to have all of this attention, but it comes with the territory.  It sure made me proud to see you up there, and congratulations on the accomplishment.

Subject:	Litigation report

A number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted on behalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which we summarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices. Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.

1. Corporacion Nacional del  Cobre de Chile (""Codelco"" )  v.  MG Ltd, MGAG and MGCC

This is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim from Slaughter & May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML, which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.

Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made subject to prior approval by legal.

Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for 5-6 weeks, commencing October 2001. Significantly, and as you will be aware, High Court proceedings take place in public.

 - LT010810084_3.doc 


2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National Corporation

Claim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August 2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China. Solicitors: Clyde & Co.


3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing House

Claim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses believed to be US$800,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar inapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations with Standard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally (and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recent offer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject to unacceptable conditions. Solicitors: Allen & Overy.

4. Nickel explosion in furnace in Cleveland: Scandia Transport  LMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter)

Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss being established now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, and have therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgent basis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC by Phoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assume possibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaiting advice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should become sufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3).

NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are known to exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared.

5. LME arbitration: Chinese receiver/ICD/Brandeis/EMC/EML/LCH/Warehouse

Claim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LME warrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involves significant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed in arbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH (and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceed the amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3.

===========================================================================
*  Investors appear to have been racing to sell ENE shares because of its
   apparent high P/E multiple (ignoring the considerable value of segments
   including Enron Energy Services, telecom and non-energy wholesale
   services) and misconceptions about a number of issues including its
   stalled asset disposition program (the Portland General Electric sale
   could be significantly delayed), the market position of its Indian power
   plant and California energy issues.  We believe that the current period
   of perceived uncertainly is actually an excellent opportunity to buy
   into a company that we view as virtually unique in the economy.  We
   believe that the energy industry in the United States and world is
   undergoing a major transformation and that a very few companies led by
   Enron are positioned to create efficiencies and provide the products,
   services and flexibility required by customers.  We believe these
   opportunities will lead to growth in earnings of 25% over the long term
   even if telecommunications makes only slow progress and does not come
   close to reaching our expectations.

*  Enron is likely to report strong results in Q1 and 2001 from all core
   businesses.  Although mgmt indicated on its March 23rd conf. call that
   it was 'very comfortable' with  ests of $1.70 to $1.75, we continue to
   be very confident that the company will equal or exceed our $1.80
   estimate.  Wholesale Services is likely to have an 'outstanding quarter'
   according to CEO Jeff Skilling with a 25% to 35% increase in natural gas
   volumes and a doubling of financial volumes.  Retail appears on track to
   achieve its $30 billion of new contract signings and turn profitable in
   2001 on a fully allocated basis.  Telecom has progressed at a slower
   pace than expected by investors as bandwidth trading has turned out to
   be more complicated to implement than some believed and the content
   business (now without Blockbuster as a partner) appears to also be
   developing more slowly than implied by Enron in 2000.  This said, the
   business opportunities in both parts of telecom appear to be excellent.

Obtaining additional D & O coverage; and, 3. Defense counsel selection in light of the possible ""advise of counsel"" defense and subrogation rights of the carriers.  I know that you are covered up, but I would not expect discussion of these issues to take more than 15 minutes. I will wait to hear form you or Steph. Thanks.

Subject:	Directorship Of ECAP

George

Further to our conversation of 5am today Sydney time, I am today formally resigning as a Director of Enron Coal Asia Pacific Pty Ltd (ECAP). As I have been discussing with Stu for the past few weeks, in the current environment it has been increasingly difficult for me to carry out my duties as a Director without an ongoing commercial knowledge of the operation. Further to this, with the accounting now being done from London, I have no day to day contact with ECAP's financial position and this further complicates my position. 

In light of this concern I advised Stu a few weeks ago that it would be preferable to have one of the resident commercial staff take over this role and I believe this would now be the appropriate action for ECAP to take. My resignation will leave ECAP with no resident Director as is required under Aust Corporations law. (As promised I will have our trading lawyer, Robert McGrory, send you an email today outlining the implications of this breech). While this will cause a deterioration in the position of ECAP, I feel I have no option but to take this action given the current position of Enron and our alternate views on the implications of these for ECAP. I have previously indicated to Stu that this is a matter that would need to be addressed and the lack of resolution is not sufficient reason for me to retain the role. 

The action of Dynergy in terminating the proposed merger today would indicate that a review of the ability of ECAP to meet all current debts should be undertaken and had I remained as a Director I would have been recommending that a Board meeting be called to address this matter and potentially appoint an administrator if required. This action has been conducted for every other company in Sydney, hence similar consideration by ECAP Directors must be an immediate priority. Unless the Directors can satisfied yourselves that all debts will be met as and when they fall due an Administrator must be appointed to avoid personal liability and potential criminal liability. An new debts subsequently incurred included ongoing rent, travel and operating costs will be come personal liabilities of the Directors.

Regards

Heidi

Dear Mr. Lay, 

My employment with Enron is to be terminated, the reason given by HR, for not meeting performance standards.  However, I firmly believe that this is not the real reason, the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager (Mr. Lowell Bezanis,Manager, EGM) who, I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me.  I have since filed a written complaint to Enron's EEO Committee. 

This committee, having investigated the case, has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings.  As a consequence, my reasonable request for a re-deployment package has been rejected.   

If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job, but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past 8 years.  The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for 30 days.  I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner, unnecessarily, since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife (not only towards myself but also to other employees, some of whom have left as a result) in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions. 

I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability, often receiving compliments from clients.  This cannot be the only way to solve this issue! 

The Trigger and Retaliation.    

Since Mr. Bezanis has been my line manager, internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me.  On August 28, I attended a class of 'natural gas structuring'. Mr. Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs, however, I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge. 

I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms. Shanna Funkhouser (my HR representative).  The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before Ms.Funkhouser.  Mr. Bezanis and Mr. Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered.  Feeling intimidated, I requested that I meet with Ms. Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO, as agreed previously.  She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment.  I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination. Ms. Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following: 

-        the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work 
-        that I was making jobapplications by company email 

Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment. 

As a manager, Mr. Bezanis has: 

-        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals.  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval. 

-        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance (PRC process) which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers' and clients' by review.  Until now, Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results. 

-        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an 'energy index' as a potential useful trading instrument.  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite, but the reaction of Mr. Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first.  I was banned by him from developing the idea further. 

Discrimination. 

It is our belief that Mr. Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees, especially competent women, as equals.  His rough, stifling, and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms. Courtney Campbell, the other only woman reporting to him.   





Hostile Working Environment. 

The working environment under Mr. Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one. Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common. Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence.  We are managed by ""threats"" rather than constructive comments.   

Wrongful Termination. 

Knowing I was unfairly treated, Enron HR has not helped address my concerns.  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process.  Ms. Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair, but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases.  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers, no matter how wrong they are.  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time. 

I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case. 

Yours sincerely, 


Mingcheng Lian

Subject:	Piedra Buena Dispute/Litigation

	As you might recall from the monthly litigation reports, Enron America del Sur has been involved in an ongoing dispute with Central Piedra Buena (""CPB"") relating to approximately $3.3 million that Enron claims it is owed pursuant to a 1999 natural gas sales agreement. 
	 More specifically, pursuant to the sales agreement, Enron was to sell natural gas to CPB.  Enron bought this gas from a gas distribution company called Total.  The sales agreement and the purchase agreement contained similar provisions and Enron acted primarily as a middleman in the transactions. 
	Beginning in December 1999, after a change in CPB's management, CPB stopped paying Enron for the gas that was supplied.  As a basis for non-payment, CPB claimed that Enron had made numerous mistakes in calculating what was due from CPB.  CPB also made vague allegations of wrongdoing on Enron's part. The parties (including Total) have been negotiating for months in an effort to resolve their disputes; however, these negotiations have been unsuccessful.
	We would like approval to initiate an arbitration against CPB for the money they owe us which, in turn, we owe to Total. Although we believe that CPB may have set-off rights for a very small amount of the sums claimed, their failure to make any reasonable offer to resolve this matter has necessitated that we resort to arbitration.
	  Guido Tawil of the Bomchil firm has been helping us in our efforts to negotiate a settlement and would represent Enron in the arbitration.  Pursuant to the parties' agreement, this would be an ICC arbitration, would occur in Buenos Aires and Argentine law would apply. Additionally, several arbitrators have been interviewed and, in Guido's opinion, our best choice is Sergio La Pera, a commercial law specialist who has a good bit of experience as an arbitrator.  According to Guido, Mr. La Pera is available and wiling to serve on the arbitration panel.
	Should you need any additional information or have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject:	Enron Corp. interests

Jim,   as I mentioned to you earlier we are forging ahead with the Enron Corp. interests project in Europe.  We commenced our work based on discussions with Jim Fallon, Ray Bowen and others about a week ago and plan to pay the employees with funds currently held by EEFT.  I expect to receive tomorrow a formalized structure for the teams, again organized around EEFT.  As I understand it, however, this proposal will not address any retention bonuses for the teams because this issue is still under discussion.  I have been told that there is hesitancy on the part of some in Houston to provide for such payments but I do not know the reason for that hesitancy.  

May I suggest that it would be entirely appropriate to provide for retention payments in this case.  As I have mentioned, part of this project is to recover value from existing contracts in entities such as ECTRIC, which value is estimated in the aggregate to be $150 to 200 million.  Another aspect of the Corp. interest project is to properly wind up entities so as to recover value and minimize director liabilities.  A proposal was made that a percentage of the recovered value would be put into a bonus pool and shared among all of the team members, whether those individuals had focused on recovery of funds or minimizing liabilities.  I am told that this proposal was rejected in a conference call held today.

I am very concerned about our ability to keep people working on this project without some additional incentive.  The project is extremely difficult and many people, in particular the traders who are in a position to protect value in ECTRIC, have other job options.  In addition, the employees on the team are aware that many individuals who are working on PWC teams are receiving retention payments.  If the team to protect the ECTRIC interests is not retained in the short term, ECTRIC is scheduled to be put into administration on January 4, resulting in termination of many of its in-the-money contracts and a loss of an estimated 50% of its value. 

Jim, if you are inclined to support retention payments to help us maintain this effort going forward, will you please communicate that fact to Jim Fallon, Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen tomorrow, as it is likely we will begin to lose people after Christmas.  Thank you.

Jim said that he wanted this group to meeting on Wednesday, May 2.  Do you want lunch served in the room, or should we break for lunch?  Should either your assistant or Stephanie Harris be included?

Please confirm that this is the correct list.  Once I get that from you, I will send out an e-mail to the these people so that we can know how many rooms to reserve for Tuesday night.  Some people may want to come over Tuesday, while others may just fly over Wednesday morning.

Thanks for your help!

No, these limits would only to apply to items in the electronic catalog, which wouldn't include outside services.  As it now stands, the system will be used for procurement of items like office supplies, catering, computers, etc.

Thanks!

Is this meant to cover invoices from outside counsel?  If it is, please discuss the proposal with Rob Walls.  Thank you. Jim

The Corp. design of the iBuyit system is well underway.  We appreciate your initial support of the system and would like to solicit your input on some system details that will be custom to the Corp. deployment and may be used eventually for other business units' standards.  Bob Butts has approved the following request limits for Corp. Accounting, and we need to get your ""OK"" as well for implementation.  Please call me at x33896 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposal.

Request limits:  The system allows setup of graduated dollar limits for order amounts based on job classification, which are listed below, with some examples of items that might fit within each limit.  Requests with totals below these limits would flow through the system without any further authorization required.  Exceptions to these levels can be made on an individual basis, and those individuals will be identified as we get closer to implementation.
	
Level 1	Clerks/Sr. Clerks	$250		Routine office supplies, beverages, pager, computer keyboard
Level 2	Admins/Specialists	$500		Small furniture, larger supply orders, palm pilot
Level 3	Sr. Specialist		$5,00		Computer, fax machine, furniture
Level 4	Manager		$25,000
Level 5	Director/Sr. Director	$100,000
Level 6	Vice President		$250,000
Level 7	Managing Director	$500,000
Level 8	EVP			$1.0M
Please note that these amounts fall within the Enron standards for invoice approval authority.  In our meetings with Stakeholders and Change Agents, we got a clear message that lower ordering authorization was preferable.  

Approval Flow:  The system allows approval flow to be customized to each department.  For example, Public Affairs could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to flow first to an Admin for approval, then to a Sr. Specialist or higher for final issuance.  The Accounting department could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to go directly to a Director for the first level of approval.  Under the limits proposed below, a $650 request by a Sr. Specialist would not be routed, as it would fall under the specified ordering authorized level.  As we get closer to the implementation date, we will work with the designated Stakeholders to design the approval flow for your departments.

Controls:  As with any system, a concentrated effort can bypass built-in controls.  As a control mechanism, we've proposed that SAP generate a periodic report so that cost center owners can conveniently track ordering activity.  The team is working on the best way to generate and deliver this report.

I appreciate your ""OK"" on the above, or any feedback you might have.

Regards,
Elizabeth Linnell

Subject:	FW: Organizational Change


One of my goals as ETS General Counsel is to assure that the group is organized in a way that allows all of us to provide quality services to our clients in the most efficient manner possible.  One of the ways to do this is to modify our internal organization to better track the ""functionalized"" organization that ETS has recently adopted in the operations and commercial areas.  Additionally, we must continually revisit the way we allocate our resources to reflect client priorities.  Accordingly, I am pleased to announce that Colleen Raker will begin reporting directly to me, effective immediately.  Richard Melton, Lee Huber and Kim Wilkie will report to Colleen.  Colleen's team will have primary responsibility for serving the ""new business generation"" efforts within Steve Hotte's IT group and Phil Lowry's Operations group.  Additionally, Colleen's team will focus on asset purchase and sale transactions and financings, while Colleen and Richard will take lead responsibility on pipeline security efforts led by Mike Nelson's team.  Each of these lawyers will also continue serving the numerous other clients they assisted before this organizational change.

Lou Soldano's group will continue its emphasis on serving the needs of the rest of Phil Lowry's organization, including the key area of right of way acquisition and other legal requirements related to pipeline expansions.  Greg Porter's group will continue its focus on   commercial and regulatory activity on the NNG and TW systems.  Greg's group gets reinforcements on Monday, as Bill Rapp is joining us from EES.  Bill will focus on TW matters, and will coordinate closely with Tony Pryor, Maria Pavlou, and Greg and Dot as he gets up to speed on the busy TW docket.  Dot McCoppin's group will continue its role supporting all commercial and regulatory activity for Citrus/FGT.  Dot's group will also assist with TW matters as appropriate.

Given the dynamic business we are a part of and the small size of our group, the organizational structure outlined above is intended to be very flexible.  Each of us will continue to be called on by clients to assist with projects that don't fit neatly into the above structure.  That is part of the challenge we face, but also part of the fun we enjoy!  

Please join me in congratulating Colleen on her new responsibilities and in welcoming Bill to the group on Monday!

   Here's the drill.
   I understand that Jim will come here on Sunday night. We'll book him a
   room
   at the Atlanta Ritz-Carlton, right next to the office.
   Bobby will arrive Monday in time for lunch and we'll set up a few people
   anxious to talk to Jim after lunch.
   We will leave here about 4:15 to arrive and drive down Magnolia Lane at
   6:30
   p.m. Take a tour, have a putting contest or whatever, drinks and dinner.
   Next morning we'll play 18, have lunch and play either the par 3 or
   another
   nine, then leave about 4:30 to get Sam back to Atlanta in time for a
   dinner
   he has here that night.Jim and Bobby could catch any plane after about 9
   or
   spend the night here. Let us know if you want hotel reservations for
   Tuesday
   night. If so, do you want to play East Lake Wed. a.m.?
   NO SHORTS,ONLY LONG PANTS at Augusta.
   I think no cell phones, too. I have the caddies yardage book, which the
   three of us can memorize on the way over.
   Sam shot 69!!!! last weekend at a nearby course, so we'll see if the
   secret
   can stay around that long.
   This will be great fun and we are all looking forward to it.

appreciate it.  If the time listed for each of you, is insufficient, or
longer than you would like, please let me know.

I think the most important thing regarding the program is to start as

possible, while giving everyone ample opportunity to enjoy their meal,
socialize, and to recognize both of you.

I work in Government Affairs, supporting EBS.

Dear Colleagues:

A number of you have expressed interest in TI-USA providing a forum where
your corporate regulatory and compliance counsel could share experiences and
questions on anti-bribery compliance best practices.  The forum would provide
an off-the-record environment for in-house counsel only to have a very
practical and candid discussion on a range of issues, such as how much due
diligence is enough.

Honeywell has offered to host an exploratory luncheon meeting on November 1
from 12:30 p.m -2 p.m. at its offices: 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite

We would appreciate your passing this invitation to the appropriate person in
your organization.

Subject:	Canadian Retail

Jim and Mark, as you know, we have established a retail affiliate within Enron Canada known as Enron Direct.  In addition, EES has a Canadian entity, EES Canada, which was established for the purposes of entering into some cross-border transactions in Canada.  For various reasons, it has been decided to roll Enron Direct into EES Canada reporting, commercially, to Rob Milnthorp, who will in turn report to Dave Delainey.  There are two legal/governance-related issues that I wanted to raise with you:

1.	Governance:  As a result, it will be necessary to make various corporate re-organizations to EES Canada.  This will include having EES Canada established as an Alberta corporation, where Enron Canada has, and Enron Direct will have, its principal Canadian office.  In relation to this, I was considering that EES Canada should be organized consistent with Enron Canada, with two Canadian resident nominee directors and Canadian-resident officers.  A few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related ""permanent establishment"" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada.  Accordingly, Enron Canada was re-organized with a nominee board of directors consisting of Rob Milnthorp (as the senior commercial employee) and me (as the senior legal employee) with a Canadian slate of officers being the Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or commercial-support groups.  I was thinking of doing likewise with EES Canada.  Although I have not yet obtained a copy of the corporate records for EES Canada, I believe the current directors of EES Canada are Jim and an outside lawyer at Blake, Cassels & Graydon in Toronto, Ernest McNee.  I am not sure, but it is also likely that various US-based employees of EES are designated as the officers of EES Canada.  Would it be appropriate to re-organize EES Canada along the same lines that Enron Canada has been organized, or do you have concerns?

2.	Law Firm:  Following-up on our conversation last week, I want to confirm that our continued use of Donahue Ernst & Young for this retail project was ""grandfathered"" on the basis that they were ""up the learning curve"" on a number of the contracting, regulatory, licensing and market participation issues.  There is one twist, however, with respect to EES Canada.  Although I was not involved, I believe that EES Canada was established to execute on some gas transactions in Ontario with the use of a Blakes partner in Toronto, Ernest McNee.  However, as the focus of the business initiative in Canada will, at least in the near future, be more involved and predominantly, if not entirely, in Alberta; and as Donahue Ernst & Young is involved in regulatory proceedings on our behalf with respect to market design issues affecting the Alberta gas and power markets, as well as being familiar with the licensing and contracting requirements for Enron Direct in Alberta; and given my understanding that Blakes' involvement with EES Canada has been relatively limited, I think it would make sense to have Donahue Ernst & Young continue on with this matter.  I am, however, sensitive to Jim's concerns, and therefore wanted your thoughts on the matter.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Peter

Subject:	Taking it to the house


To my friends and colleagues: 
        After 27+ years with Houston Pipe Line Company (under the successive ownership of HNG, InterNorth, Enron, and now AEP), I've decided to try something different.  As of September 30, I will no longer be getting up and driving downtown to work every day.  Much has happened in 2001, on personal, family, professional, national, and global levels, which has induced me to act on my inclination to retire (I've been thinking about it ever since I got that solicitation from AARP).  There is much that I will miss (daily camaraderie with co-workers and colleagues, challenging work, interesting projects, a paycheck), but there are other things that I can do without (rush hour traffic, cumbersome regulations, long hours, irreconcilable conflicts, office politics, tedious paperwork, seemingly endless meetings, payroll deductions).  On balance, it looks like a fair trade. 
        I have enjoyed the very good fortune of having a challenging and satisfying career, and of having been able to do so in the company of many wonderful people.  I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for your friendship and support over the years, for contributing to my never-ending education, and for being a valued part of my experiences and memories.  There have been a lot of good times, and some less good times, but I wouldn't want to start all over again and see how it turns out next time around.  I am enormously grateful for all of my many blessings, and hopefully the same is true for you.   
        My general plan for right now is to contemplate the future and my place in it, which sound pretty good to me -- both the process of contemplation as well as the future itself.  I do intend to find some arguably productive and/or fun ways to spend my new otherwise idle time, and finding out what those may be should be half the fun.  Perhaps the biggest concern is how long Linda will be able to tolerate my not getting up and leaving the house every weekday morning, but she's at the church a lot of the time anyway.  I'm sure the boys are wondering how my being around the house more will affect their tranquility and privacy, and that remains to be seen, although I doubt that I'll be hanging out with them and their friends very much anyway. 
        One of my specific resolutions as we go forward is to do a better job of keeping up with friends.  The wonders of e-mail will facilitate that endeavor, but I will also be available in person for lunches, happy hours, tee times, dinners, movies, and other consultations. I already know where to find you; reciprocally, my contact information will now be tsheltont@aol.com; 3507 Plumb, Houston, TX 77005; phone 713-665-5315; and fax 713-665-7410.  As time goes on, I may self-indulgently send e-mail updates; if you consider them ""spam,"" you know where the ""Delete"" button is. 
        Linda and I will be out of town on a trip to New England next week, but when we return I will commence a substantially different way of life.  I am eagerly anticipating whatever the future may hold.  Like most people, I'm anxious to spend more time with my family (they may be a little anxious about that, too).  Myriads of exciting new opportunities and challenges undoubtedly await, and I'm looking forward to discovering and pursuing many of them.  The list of things I want or need to do is already quite long, and will likely grow even faster than I can check things off the list. 
        As for the very immediate future, I'm going to click on ""Send,"" pick up my briefcase, and head for the elevator.  We have to get ready to go to Brian's volleyball tournament in Dallas tomorrow.  So long for now, best wishes, and see ya around.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

You probably know about this case already, but this was filed this week in Federal Court: 
Pamela Tittle et al. v. Enron Corp. et al. 
11/13/2001-3913 
The description of the facts are: 
Possible class action ERISA violation case in which the defendants failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties to an Enron employee retirement plan by misrepresenting the financial status of hedging agreements made with third party partnerships.
The plaintiff's attorney is Robin Harrison.  I know Robin quite well.  He does not do that much employment work, and is more of a commercial litigator.  As you know, I have done a substantial amount of ERISA work and would be interested in helping Enron out on this case.  Please let me know what we can do to help.

Subject:	Mahonia X Advance Payment Guarantee Bond/Hartford Bond	#61BSAP3909

Jim-On the last advance payment bond we executed in December 2000, Hartford participated at a limit of $52.8 million.  A separate and specific indemnity agreement was executed by Enron in favor of Hartford which contains a trigger collateral call event for 100% security in the form of a letter of credit if the credit rating of Enron falls below BBB or Baa2.  (There is an option to have the bond terminated in lieu of posting a LOC, but I doubt if that is a viable alternative).  Hartford called today and indicated with the downgrade this morning by Moody's, we are now at the edge of the trigger event.  They are sending a letter to the attention of your general counsel confirming this condition  in the indemnity agreement.  I've asked them to send me a telefax of the letter, which I will forward to you.  This is not a call for collateral at this point; Hartford simply wants to reinforce the potential requirement.  I'm sending a copy of this to Joe Deffner so he will know what is transpiring if he gets a call.

Call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Hi, Jim.

We had a great group of people working on the CLE committee this year.  The committee was a combination of people identified by the various general counsels, plus people I knew and thought would be reliable volunteers.  I believe that one of the current committee members would be a logical choice to chair next year's law conference CLE program.  (I know that I would have felt a little more confident had I sat on the committee before taking the helm).

Although most of the committee members contributed to the effort, any of  the following lawyers would be strong candidates to chair next year's CLE committee:  Carlos Sole, Rose Engeldorf, Michelle Hicks, Susan Scott, Marianne Castano, Brenda Funk, or Kriste Sullivan.  David Koogler, who was not an active member of the committee, but nonetheless was responsible for a speaker, also would be a good choice (in fact, for some reason, EBS is under the impression that it is next on the list, so David and Michelle would not be surprised if they were tapped for the job -- co-chairs may be a good idea).

Let me know if you have any questions or would like any more information on the committee or other aspects of the law conference CLE program.

As I mentioned in my voice mail, I enjoyed chairing the committee and thank you for the opportunity.

Michelle

Jim, I am so glad that the 2001 law conference went so well -- we have received many favorable comments from the attendees.  Today we had a post-conference meeting with the group that worked on the conference, and we went over what worked well and what didn't.  It was very productive.

One of the things that came out of our meeting was the need to promptly appoint next year's Chairman of the CLE committee.  Michelle feels that putting that person in place now will greatly aid in the transition from this year to next year's planning.  As a matter of fact, she is meeting with her committee for the last time next week and would love to announce the new chair at that time.

So, could you please think about to whom you would like to give that distinct honor?  I've asked Michelle to e-mail you information about her committee and her suggestions regarding a chair.

Thanks so much for your help and input.

	This follows up on my voice-mail to you of just a few minutes ago.  I reviewed a voice-mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the new Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F&J.  She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions.  Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date.  Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said.

	I see two options:

	1.  If you agree with me that we can't sign the letter as is:  I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today.  If I can't, Mariner retains someone else today.   Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started.

	2.  If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn't budge, we may have to sign the letter as is.

	Caveat:  I don't know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly.  Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys.  

	I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC, this morning what our game plan is, and if it is option one, have her go ahead and contact her back-up choices of law firms, start running conflicts checks, etc., and have them be ready to hit the ground running.

	If there is anyone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know.

	I am in all day today; please let me know what you want me to do.

Jeff--nice to see you at the bike ride on Saturday, and to meet you at the
luncheon Monday honoring Jim Derrick. Thought you might be interested in the
report I prepared for people who pledged to MS in connection with the bike
ride over the weekend.

Several persons who have either pledged, or are considering a pledge, to the
National Multiple Sclerosis Society have left messages or sent emails asking
if I am still alive after the MS150 charity bike ride held this past
weekend. Others have asked for a report of my experience. I am alive and
sore. If you are not interested in the report, please delete this email.

First of all, for those who have pledged or already sent you checks payable
to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society,  thanks is an inadequate word.
Remember that you are helping colleagues and others, and perhaps yourself
with your contributions.

This bike ride charity event turned out to be a story unlike anything I ever
expected.

Here is my story, if you are interested:

BASIC FACTS:

1.  I did show up for the bike ride (5:30 am Saturday).

2.  I did start the bike ride (7:10 am) with approximately 9400 bikers in
the largest charity bike ride in the country.

3.  I did ride my bike across the finish line in Austin the following day,
some 199 miles down the road..

4.  I did either ride my bike, or push it up several hills, for approx. 182
miles of the 199 mile route.

5.  I crossed the finish line in Austin only a few minutes before the
deadline of 6:00 pm on Sunday.

6.  I ended up meeting in one way or another almost every biker on the trip.
That resulted from the fact that I started at almost the very front of the
pack of 9400 bike riders, and was passed by nearly all of them before I
reached Austin.

7.  I am extremely pleased to have participated in the event.  I don't have
the time to participate in such events very often, and I was fortunate to
have a schedule which opened up just in time for me to enter this event.


RANDOM GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:

1.  The charity event title, ""MS150"", is a misnomer.  When I signed up for
this event, I understood the ""150"" part of the event title to refer to the
mileage between Houston and Austin. I was wrong.  The ""150"" I now understand
to mean the approximate number of blisters to be found on one's posterior
when a biker crosses the finish line.

2.  I have driven from Houston to Austin many times in the past.  There are
routes between the two cities that are generally flat with hills of a gentle
grade.  We took a different route.

3.  The ride from Houston to Austin by car is about 160 miles. The route we
took was almost 40 miles further.  The bike ride route displayed on a map
appeared similar to that which you might expect to be drawn by asking an
Aggie to find the shortest distance between two points.

4.  Road kill if far more attractive from a car than from a bike.

5.  The chicken ranch in LaGrange is long gone, but the spirit lingers.  The
LaGrange fair gounds was the venue for dinner and lodging at the end of the
first day of biking. We were welcomed there by the local Rotary Club
volunteers with a scrumptuous dinner of barbecued chicken and salad with
ranch dressing.  I laughed out loud when I saw the meal being served, and
wondered whether the historical connection was intentional.

STRATEGY

I knew when I signed up for this event that I had almost no chance of
completing the ride which, at the time I entered, I thought was only 150
miles.  I had not trained at all for the bike ride, and was (and am) not
physically fit and dont exercise as I should.  The total extent of my bike
riding during the year prior to the event was when rode my mountain bike
from my home to a sporting goods store to buy supplies one week before the
trip.  Round trip, my ""training"" ride to the sporting goods store was about
3 miles.

I sufficiently realistic to know that I needed a strategy to gain some
advantage to make up for the lack of althletic readiness.  I came up with
what I thought was the perfect solution. Before the race started, I looked
for the largest biker I could spot.  My plan was that if I rode my bike
during the ride immediately behind a very large person, I could draft that
person (Nascar style), and gain a considerable aerodynamic advantage.  I
thought it was a terrific idea and I figured that even if the large person
had a slower pace than I desired, the advantage would be apparent by the end
of the ride.  Luckily, I found just the person I was seeking---this person
appeared to be about 300-325 pounds--a body that would clear a nice swath of
air for me to follow.  When the race started, I maneuvered my bike and
pulled immediately behind the biker who was to be my air blocker.   For the
first 5 minutes of the ride, my strategy worked great--I actually could tell
that my air resistance was considerable less when I was directly behind this
large person.  Then, the unexpected happened----my large person biker turned
on her afterburners and left me in the dust.  Never again on this bike ride
was I again able to catch and draft another biker.

I needed a new strategy---perhaps a tail wind, which did in fact materialize
in spades,  but not before noon the second day of the ride.


THE RIDE IN DETAIL

I signed up for this event about two weeks in advance of the ride as a
result of my schedule opening up unexpectedly when it was previously heavily
commited.  I did it largely on  a lark, but the event took on new meaning
when I learned of close friends who have been stricken with MS after I
started the fund raising effort, which is a required part of participating
as a rider.

I knew I was out of shape and had been asked by friends if I had gone loco
in even attempting this strenuous activity.  I agreed that I could not keep
up the normal pace of younger and far more physically fit bikers.  So, I
made a pledge to myself.  No matter what, I was not going to overexert
myself.  I would establish a reasonable pace and not even get close to being
winded.  I succeeded in executing this plan until lunch on the first day of
the ride.

I kept a pace that was clearly nonstrenous and I felt good about the ride
for the first 4 hours or so, which was mostly level road.  I was very happy
with the ride, and was looking forward to the tasty box lunch that the
announcer has promised at the start of the day was waiting for every biker
when we reached Bellville, about 50 miles from Houston.  When I got to
Bellville, I came to realize that my pace, although not strenous, was
substantially off the mark.  With a box lunch prepared for over 9000 riders,
there were only four box lunches left when I arrived in Bellville. As I
thought back, I remembered being passed by many bikers.  I  did pass, by my
count, 9 bikes before lunch as if they were standing still.  They were.
They all had flat tires.   I decided I needed to pick up the pace at little
after lunch.

I headed out after a quick lunch to try to make up some time.  By around
2:00 to 3:00, I was really getting tired and although still cautious about
over exertion, I was losing energy fast. I stopped at a pay phone booth in
a small town, and called home. I told my 13 year old son William I did not
think I would make it much further.  But I wanted to go as far as I could.
I rode about 10 more miles, and was almost totally out of steam when I
remember thinking ""I desparately need a long rest"".  About that time, I
looked up at a road sign that said ""Cemetery, next exit"".  The symbolic
connection was compelling!  I decided it was time to take a rest--a
temporary, not a permanent, one.  I biked past the cemetery where I lay down
in some high grass along the road to catch my breath. The local chiggars and
I bonded almost immediately.  I then flagged down a ""SAG"" bus, designed to
pick up weary bikers, and got help loading first my bike, then my body, into
a van.  I remember telling the driver that I was ""finished"" and that I did
not think I could bike anymore for the rest of the way to Austin.  I was
extremely disappointed because I had gone only about 62 miles, and about 80%
of the donations pledged to me were based on distance traveled.  I concluded
I was destined to fall far short of my fundraising goal.

After traveling in the van for about 15 miles, we came upon the entrance to
a ranch of a friend of mine that I had visited only a couple weeks ago. I
asked the van driver to let me out so that I could see if my friend was
home.  I went to visit the friend, but he was not at his ranch house, and I
ended up spending about an hour taking a nap while waiting for him.  I
finally decided to leave, and found that the rest had given me new strength.
I thought I might be able to ride again.  To make a long story short, I rode
for about another 4 hours straight until it was total dark.  A van came and
picked me up on the highway and told me it was too dark to continue. I was
only 3 miles short of LaGrange, our stopover spot for the night, and the van
carried me on to this historic spot.

I had really been looking forward to reaching LaGrange because I was a
member of Team Enron, and Enron's hospitality for its bike riders was by
reputation, outstanding.  They had hired 40 messeuses to give massages to
the Team Enron bikers, and a dinner fit for a king would be waiting.
Unfortunately, by the time I arrived at the LaGrange Fair Grounds, our
accomodations for the evening, dinner in the Enron tent was over and all the
masseuses had vanished.  I finally found a general meal service hosted by
the local Rotarians who were serving barbecued chicken, and a salad with
ranch dressing.

Since I didnt enter the bike event until less than two weeks before it
started, Team Enron's private tent was full and I was relegated to find
sleeping space on my own.  I was directed to a huge feedlot covered with a
large tin roof, open air style (no walls).   As I nestled in my sleeping bag
under the big roof with about 2000 other bikers, my senses told me that I
was probably to sleep where a cow going to market had probably slept only
days before.  But I was dog tired, simply wanted to sleep, and didnt have
the energy to find less aeromatic, alternative, accomodations.


THE SECOND DAY


I was told that breakfast would be served at 530 am the next morning, and
that the ride would start at sunup, about 640 am.  I concluded that I could
sleep until 6 am, grab a quick bite, and still be at the starting gate by
640.  Needless to say, I was happy with my plan to get as much sleep as
possible.  I badly needed the rest. My plan failed.

I did not take into consideration that I was sleeping among a bunch of
gung-ho superbikejocks.  About 4 am, some two hours before I planned to wake
up, a large group of overenenergetic-supercyclists arose and started doing
side straddle hops, stretching, and various exercises while making Monica
Seles-like grunting noises.  I was not amused.  There was no way to go back
to sleep! The five hours of sleep I managed on Saturday night was wholly
inadequate.

I was told that Day 2 of the bike ride was much more difficult than Day 1
because of the more hilly route as we approached Austin.  To make a long
story short,  I actually gained strength on Day 2 as compared to Day 1. I
actually learned some technique for transferring power from my arms to my
legs, and made it to Austin on my own power without any motorized help of
any kind.

The ride through the hill country was spectacular.  Also, I did get a taste
of ole country Texas along the way. The bike route intentionally meanders
via remote roads through small towns in order to avoid heavy highway traffic
for the safety of the bikers.  As we passed through one small town that I
never heard of before, I looked up to see a sign that said  ""THELMA'S
PLACE---POOL, BEER DOMINOS"". A sign of equal size immediately adjacent said
""NO GUNS PERMITTED INSIDE"".  It was comforting to know that patrons of that
establishment could drink peacefully while game playing, knowing that
customers are  required to go out to the parking lot to resolve domino
disagreements where guns are not prohibited.  I guess I have spent too much
time in the major metropolitan areas of Texas, and have forgotten about the
genuine Texas back country!!


There was one other noteworthy diversion.  Cycling through Bastrop State
Park is known to be one of the most strenous parts of the trip because of
the extreme winding hills in this beautiful, heavily-wooded area.  The Park
is also confusing because of its multiple intersecting roads through the
park. I was following another biker as we approached the park who was
sporting a very fancy biking shirt on which was written TAM Cycling Club.  I
mentioned to him that I was not looking forward to entering Bastrop State
Park because of the challenging steep hills.  He responded that he knew a
route through the park that was not only less hilly, but was also 3 miles
shorter than the route intended for the bikers.  I was all ears to the
prospect of a short cut, and agreed to follow him on this less strenuous and
shorter route.  We entered the park and,  for the next 10 miles according to
my odometer, it seemed like a roller coaster ride, with turning steep
inclines, and dangerously steep and turning declines.  Exactly one hour and
ten minutes after we entered the park, we finally exited the
park--------------at the exact same place where we entered.  I was exhausted
and not amused.  I should have known that an Aggie inherently is unable to
find the shortest route to Austin.

To fast forward the story, since this has been far too long already, I made
it to Austin on my own power and did not ask for a lift at all the second
day.  I was looking forward to getting a much needed shower when I arrived
at the finishing line at the UT baseball stadium in Austin.  I had put in my
most strenuous effort during the last hour of the bike ride in the very
hilly Austin area where every hill looks like Mount Everest or its kissing
cousin.  Unfortunately for the person who sat next to me on the bus coming
back to Houston, I was told just after crossing the finish line that the
last bus would leave for Houston in only a few minutes and there was no time
to shower.  At that point in time, I looked like I just stepped out of a
sweat shower.  The stranger next to me on the bus did exactly what I
dreaded--he introduced himself, and waited for a reply.  I really didn't
want this guy to know my name--the name  of the guy who was giving the bus
the aroma of gymnasium locker room---- so after a moments thought, I held
out my still sweaty hand, and proudly said, ""Howdy, my name's Harry
Reasoner.""

Conclusion:

I participated in this event because I wanted to help my colleagues and
others who are victims of MS.  If you previously made one of those weirdo
pledges that are impossible for anyone to calculate, please send my
secretary a check made payable to National Multiple Sclerosis Society in
whatever amount makes you happy.  If you have not made a donation, won't you

do so today? You will benefit by giving as much as the people with MS who
need your help.  Thank you.

Subject:	Houston Session with Council Fellow Walter Russell Mead, October 11

Dear James:

I wanted to draw your attention to our upcoming dinner discussion on
America's Foreign Policy Tradition and the War on Terrorism.  Walter
Russell Mead, Senior Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on
Foreign Relations, will lead the discussion and Norman B. Frankel,
Physician at the Medical Clinic of Houston, will chair and host.  The
dinner will take place on Thursday, October 11, from 6:30 to 9:00 p.m. at
the River Oaks Country Club, located on 1600 River Oaks Boulevard.

In light of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration is
faced with the unique challenge of building a national consensus for what
could be the longest, most complex, and most difficult war in American
history.  Walter Russell Mead will discuss how America's foreign policy
tradition, defense culture, and diplomatic history will influence President
Bush and America in responding to the terrorist threat.  Walter has just
completed a study of the history of U.S. foreign policy at the Council on
Foreign Relations and written a book, Special Providence, due to be
published by Knopf in November.

Please let me know if you plan to participate.

Regards,
Irina

FROM:          Pat Martin, Chair
 
RE:             Mid-Year  Meeting and 2002 Oil & Gas Law Institute   
 
I would appreciate your prompt response  to the two questions presented below, regarding (1) the date of our mid-year  meeting and (2) the location of our 2002 Institute. 
At our annual meeting in San Antonio,  and pursuant to our long range plan for the center, we determined to institute  an annual mid-year meeting of the Executive Committee. An agenda will be  provided to you beforehand, but among the items for review will be our long  range plan to expand the scope of the center and recommendations from our  several new subcommittees: Programs (Chair John Lowe), Membership (Chair Jim  Armour), New Center Name (Chair Pat Martin) and Website and  Technology.
Absent a groundswell of opposition from  you, I intend to schedule this meeting for Friday, August 28, 2001 in Dallas.  Please let me know right away if this date is impossible for you.
I am happy to report that our 2002  Institute Co-Chairs, Brad Keithley of Jones Day in Dallas and Jack Lynch of BP  in Houston, will be joining us at the meeting as ex officio members of the  Executive Committee. 
Finally, attached are the results  of our poll of the 2001 Institute attendees and of our Advisory Board concerning  the preferred location for our 2002 Institute next February. It appears that all  roads lead to Houston this year. With the results of the San  Antonio program and a Houston program in hand, we will be in a better  position to determine the best home(s) for the Institute in the  future. Please let us know if Houston meets  your approval.
I appreciate your leadership at  this important time in the evolution of the center.

We really need to get an official name for the Portal. The finalists are:  

Enron Legal Edge 
Enron Legal Net
Enron Legal Source
EnLaw
Enron Legal Ease (copyright issues?) 

Who is going to pick this...Mr. Derrick, the GC's or the committee? 

I understand that you will only have a few introductory comments on the Portal rather than a 15 minute presentation. I will be meeting with you Thursday, and we can talk about what type of slides I can prepare for you to go along with your comments. We will have a Portal Demo outside the ballroom where the participants can see the demo and be provided with information on the categories. We have a new graphic design for the Portal Header which you can see below. Let me know your thoughts?

Jim, as we discussed late last night I checked with all folks in the DC office who would have any conceivable reason to talk to Treasury.  No one had a conversation yesterday where the SEC issue was discussed.  Today, I have checked with the remainder of the DC office, and no one has had such a conversation.   I hope this is helpful.

Subject:	CATS litigation

Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The opinion seeks to conclude ""what rational businessmen could have intended"" rather than applying the provisions of the contract.  

For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that the  ""retrospective consequences"" of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.

As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.

Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have been a given. 

Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our other counsel have assessed the opinion as ""appalling"" and ""pathetic,"" and describe the situation as one where Enron has been ""stitched up"".  Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse.

In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. 

Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207 783 6582.  Many thanks.

Dear Kate,

We (the four employees as mentioned below; ""The Party's"") have a labour contract with Enron Netherlands B.V. an entity of which Insinger de Beaufort / Equity Trust Co. N.V. is formally in charge. At this moment The Party's are still employed by and working for Enron in the Netherlands. Until now it looks like though The Party's will not receive the monthly payment for December 2001 that will be due on the 20th of this month (as per the respective labour contracts). Untill this month the actual payment came from the UK but it is very unlikely that this will be the case in December and onwards.

Furthermore we know that Enron Netherlands B.V. has sufficient funds in 3 different bankaccounts (in cash and collateral) and will therefore not be able to go bankrupt at this moment in time.

As Equity Trust Co. N.V. is formally in charge of this particular entity they are able (and even obliged) to do the monthly payment but they will only facilitate this as soon as they have received sufficient instructions. The instruction should not only instruct them to do the monthly payment as such but also explicitly tell them to use the available cash and/or collateral for that. For your information: the collateral I am talking about is currently still in the hands of the Dutch Transmission System Operator ('Tennet') as a kind of guarantee for the trading we used to do but no longer (can) do.

Please note as a practicality that the necessary administrative handling regarding the monthly payments (calculating nett amounts etc.) is done by PriceWaterhouseCoopers in Rotterdam. For details regarding the specific and individual monthly payment obligations of Enron Netherlands B.V. towards The Party's Equity Trust can contact mrs. Kenny Toekimin or mrs. Helene van Bommel at PWC on telephone number +31 10 400 8600.

If you have any further questions please don't hesitate to contact me in the Enron Amsterdam office on +31 20 654 1957 or on +31 10 5916168 or alternatively per e-mail.

Jeff Manning at The Oregonian called to say tomorrow's newspaper will have  another report on the Enron 401(k) problems, and the connection to PGE through  the details of three lawsuits. I said nothing new, but did clarify a quote that  had appeared from PGE in the previous story Manning wrote.
 
I've copied Doug on this because the issue is getting more serious.  Manning informed me that The Oregonian has now assigned him and Gail Hill  to ""charge ahead and do more on this story."" They want to sit down with HR and  review documentation that proves that we have provided financial planning  counsel, that we have provided information about diversifying portfolios, etc.  This is strongly leaning in the legal area, and we would like to have  counsel before saying anything further. We can't expect much cover from Enron,  either: Manning vented to me about how no one there will return his calls.
 
Carol, Gail, Kregg and I can be available to meet early tomorrow to discuss  how to move ahead on this. Doug, let us know if sometime before noon might work  for you. Thanks.

Subject:	TME Engineers Limited - Accounts 

Dear All

You may have recently received a letter from Companies House regarding the overdue accounts for TME Engineers Limited, for the period ending 30 April 2000. This letter will be sent to all directors of the Company.

The accounts for this Company were due to be filed at the end of February 2001. Unfortunately a filing extension request (form 244) was never filed and the accounts must now be filed by 3 December at the latest to avoid penalties being incurred. 

The April accounts require a Letter of Comfort to be supplied from Enron, and in the current situation this will not be possible within the timescale for filing. (The Letter of Comfort is required as the Company requires inter-company loans to remain in place for the Company to remain solvent). 

To solve this problem, the Balance Sheet of TME Engineers Limited is being restructured to ensure the directors can sign on a going concern basis, and this will be arranged within the next few days. Peter Pentecost will be calling each of you over the next couple of days to explain the background to the problem more fully and to outline the solution/answer any questions you may have.  

In case for any reason the restructure of the Balance Sheet cannot be completed by the 3 December deadline, we are agreeing with Arthur Andersen an alternative basis for the audit opinion to be signed, such that the Accounts can still be signed off and submitted by the Directors in time. 

In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns regarding this issue,  please contact Brian Muscroft on 0044 207 783 2703.

Subject:	Teamwork

Hi Jim--

The last month or so have been so hectic I have barely had time to breath.  We have gone from fire to fire.  Over the last 24 hours (since we submitted our last hurry up brief) I have been reflecting on the experience.  To say it has been positive is an understatement.

Under ordinary circumstances working under such continual pressure--with so much $ on the line--would have been stressful.  However, when you work with Enron the opposite is true.  There is such a sense of esprit d' corp that permeates your organization.  It makes difficult things easy and the impossible, just another day in the office.

There are no egos to trip over at Enron.  When there is a problem to solve, it is everyone's problem.  People are not afraid of asking questions.  They keep questioning until they understand.  Nobody minds repeating themselves.  They are incredibly patient with outside lawyers--spending hours and hours bringing us up to speed.  As you well know, yours is not a simple business.  It is so refreshing.

There are so many benefits to this team approach.

1.  You get things right the first time.  As you know, in any litigation is critical that the court view your side as the teller of truth.  Because you get things right the first time,  the company is not exposed to being discredited when the other side responds.

2.  I would bet that Enron's outside legal bills are half what they would be otherwise.  With most companies the outside (and inside) lawyers get a minimum of support from the business people.  The business people view business as business and lawsuits as an annoyance.  (I should say that I could never understand that given the direct  Perhaps it is the trader mentality at the company.  Perhaps it is an unwavering focus on the bottom line.  Perhaps it is just that everyone feels they are a part of a team and they realize that by working together the team can achieve things that no one person can do working alone.  Whatever the reason, the outside lawyer's job is made so much easier.  That results in much, much lower legal bills.

3. You increase your chances of winning.  The brainstorming is so valuable.

4. The outside lawyers, like me, feel they are part of the team.  Outside lawyers do not feel as if they are on trial.  They can ask the dumb questions.  I know that all of us here are looking forward to the next opportunity to work with the Enron team.

5.  Human nature being what it is--I think that when there are choices to be made as to whose work goes on the top of the pile--the Enron assignment goes to the top more often than not.

You have built a great legal team.  All of your legal staff should be proud of what they have built.


Thanks for letting us come along for the ride.

Regards,

Bill

Jim, as we discussed late last night I checked with all folks in the DC office who would have any conceivable reason to talk to Treasury.

RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have determined
to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date. I
hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have already
made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
<mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of your
availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

a) ____________

b) ____________

c) ____________

d) ____________

After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting for
the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members and
notify you of the new date.

Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that we
have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.

				.

Dear Friend,

I am Dr Rasheed Mohammed, the newly appointed head of
the Foreign Remittance Department in the Central Bank
of Nigeria (CBN). I got your contact from a business
directory of your country and based on your business
activities and the type of investment I have in mind,
I found you to be the most suitable person for the
transaction stated below.

 Before I proceed, I want to strongly advice that you
devoid yourself from the general conception you have
about Nigerians. I would like you to carefully study
this proposal without bias, since it would be relevant
in our lives.

It is a usual practice in Nigeria for ministers and
high-ranking government officials to divert
government's money into their private accounts; this
is usually done through CBN with the connivance of
senior officials. The ministers and military generals
especially during the era of late general sani Abacha,
achieve this by diverting most of the funds, meant for
the development of their respective agencies and
ministries into the CBN escrow accounts. Usually it is
this same escrow account that holds funds for the
payment of foreign contracts.  With the help of the
inside officials, the minister or senior government
officials and military generals would now create
themselves or employ the assistance of a foreign
partner to create them as artificial contractors,
using fiticious documents to remit the deposited money
to the nominated bank account of their foreign
partners. In this case the money is treated as payment
for foreign contract, and there is no trace. This is
how federal government's money is siphoned on a
regular basis, to the extent that most people now
result to letter scams and fraud due to the knowledge
they have about it.

Due to the impromptu removal of my successor from the
central bank, he did not have enough time to perfect
and tidy up the transactions they have in place. So
the funds are now trapped at the central bank escrow
account with no records. I just discovered this in a
bid to fulfill my obligation to submit the state of
our escrow account to the federal government and the
governor of CBN before I commence any foreign payment.
I am conducting a sort of reconciliation of our escrow
account to declare to the government the total amount
that have been spent in the last three years and what
it was spent for. So,  in the course of carrying out
the above exercise, I discovered a total sum of
$150MILLION in the escrow account that is unknown to
anyone and with no records. My intention is to reveal
about USD $100M to the federal government so that I
can be in his good books and make arrangement to
transfer the outstanding USD $50M into a safe account
abroad. It is based on this that I am making this
urgent contact with you.


However, I am doing this because of the nature of my
job. I am a civil servant that is poorly paid and more
so, there is no way I can remain in this office
forever. I have children to cater for even when I
retire as the director, which is just next year. So, I
need something tangible to fall back on when I retire.
Besides, if I declare the total funds to the
government, it would probably go into the pockets of a
few people that control the government. This is to
enlighten you on the degree of corruption in Nigeria.
So, do not blame me for my action because you would do
the same if you were in my shoes, knowing fully well
that there will be no compensation even if you
disclose everything to the government.

Well, I have discovered that I can transfer this money
if we could quickly create you as an artificial
contractor, by using your company document and Bank
account to receive the money, in the same way my
successor transferred theirs. The only difference is
that the final payment is going to be made to your
named company through any of our correspondent payment
center in Europe or America, due to the policies
adopted by the new democratic government.

The entire process is not easy, but it is achievable
due to my position in the foreign remittance
department of the CBN, and the relationship I have
with the present director of external payment and
finance of the federal ministry of finance.

The entire operation will be between the three of us:
(I) I shall take care of all documentation, (ii) My
friend in the federal ministry of finance will take
care of all lobbying and use of influence to get all
documentation, (iii) You shall take care of the
banking arrangements, provide the needed invoices to
enable us apply for claims and approvals and travel as
the beneficiary to receive the funds from the payment
center you shall be paid from.

After we have succeeded in transferring this funds,
20% shall be retained by you for your assistance, 5%
for the settlement of all debts we might incur in the
course of this transaction and the remaining 75% shall
be for me and my colleague, which we would possibly
invest in into your company or any viable business
venture you suggest.

If you are comfortable with this programme please
revert to me at once via telephone number
234-1-7593507 or fax number 234-1-7590440. Should your
response be positive, I would then instruct on the
next step to take.

Due to security reasons, when you call, do not ask for
any name, simply ask me to reconfirm the telephone
number. Once I reconfirm my number to be
234-1-7593507, you can then mention my name before you
go into any discussion. If I fail to reply correctly,
do not wait for a second trial, just drop the phone
and call back later.

We demand a quick response from you. Any delay might
result in contacting someone else. Irrespective of
what happens, we count on your maturity to keep the
transaction to yourself. So, you are advised to treat
this transaction with utmost confidentiality.

Looking forward to your urgent response.

Yours faithfully,

Dr Rasheed Mohammed

4. The outside lawyers, like me, feel they are part of the team.  Outside lawyers do not feel as if they are on trial.  They can ask the dumb questions.  I know that all of us here are looking forward to the next opportunity to work with the Enron team.

5.  Human nature being what it is--I think that when there are choices to be made as to whose work goes on the top of the pile--the Enron assignment goes to the top more often than not.

You have built a great legal team.  All of your legal staff should be proud of what they have built.


Thanks for letting us come along for the ride.

Regards,

Bill

Jarek

We were having some retention problems with Jacek for a variety of reasons.  After discussion in London we decided to increase his package.

I believe it is highly unlikely that Jacek would be interested in working out of the Warsaw office for Enron Poland.

The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

I have discussed this with Jacek.  The reason for increasing Jacek's package is retention.

	In your last memo to the general counsel, you requested that they respond to me by last Friday with respect to updating the Enron marks.  To date,  I have only received responses from Mark Haedicke, Randy Young, and John Ale.  Would you be so kind as to remind everyone again?  Thanks for your assistance.

Subject:	Hello from Tulsa

CONFIDENTIAL

Good morning, gentlemen.  Mutual colleagues in the energy industry have suggested that I contact you directly about joining the Enron organization in a senior legal or business capacity.

I relocated from San Francisco to Tulsa in 1996 when I was recruited to join MAPCO in a General Counsel's position.  A year later, MAPCO was acquired by Williams, where I have served as one of four Associate General Counsel.  I have now learned that in a merger (even one billed as a merger of equals), it is preferable to be on the buyer's side rather than to be included among those who have been acquired!!!  Thus, I am seeking new opportunities at the Deputy/Associate General Counsel level.

Williams and Enron share many of the same businesses, operations and values.  The experience gained at MAPCO/Williams, coupled with general leadership and management skills, is easily portable to another energy company. Moreover, the Company's current difficulties may create the need for a senior lawyer with substantial litigation, government investigation and policy advocacy experience.

I get to Houston often and would very much like to meet with you even if only for an exploratory discussion. My CV is attached; also, I will send to you, under separate cover, a profile which was published in Diversity & the Bar magazibe, the quarterly insert to Corporate Counsel Monthly.

My office telephone number is 918-523-3354; I look forward to meeting with you  shortly.  Thank you for your consideration.

Very sincerely,

Kirk G. Forrest
