Judy forwarded an ""Enron Market Outlook"" to PGL MGMT from Freddy-boy.  Is she trying to make us look bad?  Why is Fred going after this business?

It appears that Enron fundementals would disagree with a alot of these assertions, but it is interesting to see what CERA is expected to publish Mid-June.

Subject:  RE: Meeting with CERA

Enclosed are my notes from the discussion we had with CERA this morning. The
most important item is that CERA is revising their short-term forecast
significantly downward (from high $4.00s to high to mid $3.00s this summer).
This new forecast will be officially published next week. Please see  the
attachment for more information.

"BCP Seat Assignments","All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

He will be limited again in practice, and it's probably a good idea to keep him on reserve for Week 12 in your league.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Davis should be able to return from arthroscopic knee surgery in time for Sunday's game agains! t ! Miami. He will practice this week before a final decision is made, but we're skeptical the Broncos won't have him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' Fantasy values.  Keith Poole , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Poole has bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in his place, and the Denver passing game would further suffer.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/27/01 Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might have to start Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole's recovery from a rib injury.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 Jackson's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday to determine his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson can't go.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who missed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this season, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers will likely retain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.  Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer . ""If that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to get rid of me,"" Smith said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mop-up role. He's not a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important to note that he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Allen, who remains out with a broken hand, could return to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job once healthy. Hold onto him if you have the room on your reserve list or play in a deeper league.  M! o! e Williams , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running back, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone in his small toe, which will sideline him for at least four weeks and possibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting running back, and might be worth adding to your roster in a deeper league.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Chrebret did not practice Monday because of a shoulder injury. However, The New York Newsday reports that he is expected to play in Sunday's game.   Jake Arians , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Arians has been released by the Bills. Buffalo has signed Shayne Graham to replace him.   Edgerrin James , RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/2! 7/! 01 Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left knee was successful Saturday in Miami.  Mora said he received the news from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician. ""I spoke with him Saturday and he told me it went very well,"" Mora said. James, the two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee when he was tackled awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on injured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to take seven months. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts offseason minicamps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James will be ready for the start of training camp.     Terry Glenn , WR NE - Matty Updated 11/27/01 Glenn could be put on injured reserve if he doesn't recover from a hamstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps the end of his Patriots career. ""I haven't reached it yet,"" coach Bill Belichick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster spot would be better spent on someone other than Glenn. ""But as each day goes by, it gets a little bit closer.""      Shayne Graham , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after Jake Arians was released following a missed point-after against the Miami Dolphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start of the season.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Alexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Sunday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a deeper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday night's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the game.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Barlow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. ""It's throbbing,"" Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. ""I couldn't really sleep last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting."" Barlow is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on reserve.     Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffered a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protec! ti! ve boot as a precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he will be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo.   Jeff Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a hyperextended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Monday, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight end has very little value as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Davis, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his health, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut him altogehter.   James Stewart , RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 Stewart, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, is expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting good Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of depth at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit Free Press , Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. ""This is Charlie's offense,"" coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""He practiced a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would expect him close to full speed Wednesday."" He'll likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran tight end is listed as day to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Upda! te! d 11/27/01 According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the week.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover (neck) will likely be held out of practice this week. However, the Panthers are hopeful that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New Orleans.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Despite his inconsistent play and 14 interceptions, Weinke's job as Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is secure. ""There've been quarterbacks who have gone on to be very successful that have gone through times like this,"" coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer. ""Even though there are a number of these plays that haven't turned out and there have been disruptions in his play, I think, ultimately, it will be more beneficial than not."" While he may be the starting quarterback in Carolina, Weinke isn't worth a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Sanders, who left Sunday's game against San Diego due to nagging hamstring injuries, is questionable for the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland. However,! h! e is optimistic that he'll be available for the game. ""I'll be there,"" Sanders told the Arizona Republic. ""They're just real sore from doing a lot of running and jumping - normal wear and tear."" In any event, keeping Sanders on your bench may be a good idea against the tough Oakland secondary.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 11/27/01 Moore (hamstring) was supposed to begin some light running last week, but he ended up doing nothing of the sort. ""He hasn't made a lot of progress,"" coach Dave McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""We're going to come to a point where we're going to have to make a decision."" Moore, who has missed the entire season due to injury, could be placed on the injured reserve list this week.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"Logistics Commercial Realignment","

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

"Market Data Applet Issues","Danielle,

It's been over 2 or 3 months where we continue to experience problems with the new Market Data applet.  
The problems are ranging from the instability connection to the IFinance servers to the price update delay.

Over these past 2 to 3 months, we kept getting hammerred by our business users (traders,etc.) about these problems 
and these problems certainly reflected really bad on us as the IT support group on the trading floor.
  
Rick Le has been doing excellent supports for us.  
We are not trying to point finger to anyone in your group but we need to push these issues to Reuter's and let them know that these issues should be priority number 1 for them to fix.  It's our impression that Reuter's do not take these issues very seriously as the evidence showed that we don't have any acceptable solutions today after waiting for 2-3 months.

As we move to the new building next week, we will display the Market Data in more than 30+ plasma workstations.  The aboved mentioned problems will definitely make support very difficult.  If these problems are not fixed in the near future, we may have to seriously consider other options.  With the telerate version of the market data being more stable than the new Market Data applet, we may have to go back to use it.

Would you please help us provide better IT support to our business users.

Thanks,

"Online Trading Simulation Feb 7th","Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

"RE: Lizette Palmer- Employment Attorney","Hi Anne?
 
I've been told by Hunter Shively and David Oxley that my commitment to transitioning this organization will end when the deal closes late this week.  As such, I have met again with Hunter and Jay to make sure that my part of this transition is complete.  I am tying up some loose ends today - and hopefully these guys will have everything they need (from me) by this afternoon.  David told me that as long as these guys are satisfied - then I'm clear to go back to the estate with my job over here complete. 
 
With this new information - I do not believe that I need to meet with the employment attorney at this time.  Thank you for your help.  I will update you once things are complete over here.

Hey guys,
 
Lizette Palmer, our employment attorney, would be more than happy to meet with you at 9:30 in 3817A (old building) if you would still like some reassurance that your transition help will not create a conflict of interest.
 
Also, I am on 4 in the new building now, so if you need anything, please just let me know.

"David Woodstrom","Hunter,

As I mentioned this morning, since Zach McCarroll turned down the offer we would like to explore the possibility of keeping David Woodstrom on the IT team to fill the open position.  The Fundamentals IT team has been cut to a minimum support staff, and the addition of David would facilitate more development of fundamentals content.  David has been focusing on the operational capacity reporting (morning ops reports) by creating better ways to access the operational data (real time query tool vs. standard reports).  David also has been responsible for maintenance and development of the commodity fundamentals website since he joined the group in early 2000.  He built and maintains the current message board system used by gas trading and as well as the critical notice alerts for pipelines.  He has also worked closely with the West desk and Portland on various real time load and outage reports.  David Dronet and I both feel that the addition of David Woodstrom will allow the fundamentals team to continue producing innovative products instead of providing only support for current operations.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris

"Logistics Commercial Realignment","
After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

Kelley,

I am writing to you to follow up on our discussion last week regarding

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Below you will find attached the breakout of our sales between affiliated and third party markets.

"Re: Operations Page - Fundys Website","Hunter,
Kevin has come up with another great idea.  How about a tab for contact names and phone numbers for our counterparties and pipeline representatives?  For Y2K a database was developed in Lotus Notes to accommodate this information.  The problem was that the fields were editable only by the assistants.  If we could develop an area in the fundys website that would allow the traders and schedulers access to update the information then I believe this would eliminate many of the phone lists that are kept individually and become a very useful tool for everyone.

Lisa,

I think it might be best to have an Off/Vacation tab where we can put each pipe individually with each scheduler's phone list, meter point, and dunns number to assist anyone who is filling in for someone. We could also build/expand to include other info as desired.

This is Garrett on the Ontario Power Desk.  I will be in the Houston office spending time with the East Power Desk next week.  Let's set up a time for you to run through your Ontario Gas burn model.  Farouk and I do not need a great deal of specific information,  just enough to identify when Lennox is burning gas, and approximately how much.  Monday and Tuesday afternoon are good times for me, reply when you are available.

"Online Launch Plan Update","With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

"New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals","This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

"Operations Page - Fundys Website","Hey Hunter,
A quick update.  Kevin Brady is up to speed on working with Colin and Chris on consolidating critical and noncritical notices for all the regions.  I have also passed on the idea of an operations page on the website to the other logistics managers and the central desk schedulers to get their ideas and insights on how to make this page beneficial to both the traders and schedulers.   A couple of ideas that have already been passed my way are:

	1) Incorporating the Gas Daily and Index historicals against production/storage by pipe so that we could project cash outs (Mark Schrab)
	2) A transportation rate matrix on the web site (Cora Pendergrass)
	3) Enron operations personnel contact page with phone numbers and pictures.  Much like the weather guys.  I laughed at first but Victor LaMadrid   		whom suggested this said that the East Desk Traders don't even know all of his schedulers.
	4) An easy access to the pipelines meters and dunns numbers. (Kevin Brady)
	5) Morning sheets updated with contract, constraint, and imbalance information from Sitara and Unify (Victor LaMadrid)

I have asked Kevin to consolidate all the ideas and then we can get together and decide which ones you want to place into production.  

Lisa

Hunter,

IHS
We met with IHS this morning to discuss the data that we need to complete our supply forecasts.  It is our intent to use the monthly historical production data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling permits to build a more accurate production forecast.  We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.  

In order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services from IHS:

	US Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly
	US Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly

Next year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.  We will be able to do this after we build the historical well information into our supply forecast.

Danielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.  She anticipated having the contract today, and sending it to Chicago for approval.

PIRA
Danielle is working to finalize the agreement in the next 3 days.  I gave her a list of the services that we needed, and told her that we would like to distribute the PIRA material on the Commodity Fundamentals website instead of having individual user accounts.  Based on the services that I think we'll need (North Americal Natural Gas, North American Electricity, and the Daily Demand Forecast), our combined cost for Gas and Power in Houston, Portland, Calgary, and Toronto should be around $100,000 for 100 users.  Danielle is going to send an e-mail when she has the final price.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris

"Analyst Rotation - Gas Fundamentals","Hi Hunter,
I recently joined the A/A program as a Senior Analyst as of November 2001 on recommendations from Jim Fallon, Paul Racicot, and Nicole La and I would like to speak with you on any opportunities that you may have within the Gas Fundamentals group.  I am currently working for Paul Racicot on the EBS trading desk as a metro capacity trader but I am interested in pursuing other opportunities within Enron.  I am ultimately interested in joining the Gas trading track and believe the fundamentals group would be an excellent place to start.  I've attached a copy of my resume and two recommendation letters one from Nicole La and one Joe Edwards, who heads up the bandwidth capacity trading desk, for you to review.  If you have any questions please call me at x34212.  Jim Fallon, Paul Racicot, Nicole La and Joe Edwards would also be happy to speak with you regarding my performance and potential at Enron.

He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flut! ie! and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - G! ig! gles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Up! da! ted 11/20/01  Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler  , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think! c! an help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is! e! xpected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Giants , DT NYG - Matty Updated 11/20/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Ru! ss! ell Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job,"" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 1! 1.!   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"Hi","Hi Hunter,

I tried sending you an email earlier but I didn't have
the right address.  How are things?  I am still
looking for a job.  I have attached a copy of my
resume to this email.  If anything comes your way
could you please let me know.  I am not necessarily
fixated on trading.  It would be optimal but I will do
anything else for now.
Thank you for everything,

Dayem

"RE: suggested rotations - trading track new hires","Hunter,

We are scheduled to lose 7 in Feb 2002.
Jozef Lieskovsky
Neeran Pathak
Lauren Schlesinger
Catalina Cardenas
Bart Burk
Justin O'Malley
Bilal Bajwa

We secured 2 from the trading track schedule attached (George Huan, Gary Linhart).  The other two (Brent Dornier, Scott Freeman) are going to the West Desk.

We would be left with 6 thru Aug 2002:
Aaron Berutti
Adam Bayer
Shiela Chang
Jeremy Lo
Brian Falik
Jason Huang

I have one new hire starting in late December from Wellesley (she was an intern in Gossett's group last summer).  I would need to hire 4 people to replace the February rotations.  Talking to the group this morning, they are already asking if they can stay on past their rotation dates, as many want to stay on the gas floor.  Let me know if you have any questions or want to discuss.

Chris

All,

The attached spreadsheet outlines the rotatons for the internal new hires.    Following your changes/comments/suggestions I will forward to Lavorato so we can finalise with the analysts and associates.

Thanks, karen.

"Procedures to confirm and execute storage contracts","Going forward, I suggest the following.

Procedure for Storage Confirmation and Execution:

1.  Storage contracts mailed to trader.
2.  Trader forwards contract to short-term transport book
3.  Transport book verifies deal terms, sends a copy to back office, gets approriate signature on original, mail original to counterparty, contact counterparty to inform them that contract is executed and mailed back.
4.  Back office verifies terms, add contract to a binder, send copy to confirmation group.  
5.  Confirmation group verifies terms, add contract to their files, send a copy to Global group to scan contract in the system in order to view contract on-line via Information Management System

"A Favor!","Hey Hunter, how's it going? Got a favor. I am sponsoring a ""Summer Series"" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. 

We're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.

If you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know. Thanks!

"US Storage levels","I was looking at past levels, and I thouhgt to share my findings with you.

Highest levels as of the first week of April was in 1999 of 1,367 TCF.  Yesterday's AGA showed our levels @ 2,294.  In order to reach 1999's levels we ould need to withdraw about 103 BCF a week (2,294 less 1,367 divided vy the remaining 9 weeks until the first week of April).  

Also, 1999 had the highest levels for the third week of January, levels were 2,039.  Year 2002 is 255 bcf ahead.

(""Seller"").  I need it to specify that our obligation for the month will be not greater than original obligation minus 100,000 mmbtu/d.

Thanx,
Laura

Subject:	December baseload sale to ENA

Jim,

As per our conversation, Peoples would like to sell 100,000 MMBtu/d of
citygate gas to ENA on a baseload basis during the month of December.  The
price of this sale is NGI Bidweek Chicago Index-flat.  As we discussed, PGL
will still receive its $0.03/MMBtu credit on the full Baseload contract
volumes in the agreement, however PGL and ENA agree to offset physical
volumes.  Therefore, ENA will deliver 100,000 MMBtu less to PGL each day in
December, and that reduction in volume will come from ENA's Northern Border
deliveries.

Call me if you have any questions.

"Re: MEET w/ ERC RE: Portfolio Trading","I am setting up an internal meeting/conference call for early next week to discuss the message we want to make at FERC, and to air any sensitivities that these FERC meetings may entail.  I think that we can provide FERC staff with an opportunity to better understand the gas market, and how Enron trades to support its sales.  After agreement on our strategy and how to go forward, I will call and set up meetings with the  appropriate folks at FERC.

I've asked Bernadette Hawkins to set up a conference call.  She will be calling to try to get a convenient time for everyone.

Tom Briggs and I believe that prior to this meeting we should hold an internal session so that we can fully understand what FERC is capable of doing under its existing jurisdiction that effects our portfolio trading operations.  For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.   With respect to your specific suggestion below, we are fine with this approach if it follows the discussion suggested here.

I would recommend the following --

1.	Enron take a group of traders / commercial people to FERC next week.
	RECOMMENDATION --  Hunter Shively, Bob Superty, Stephanie Miller
2.	Target Audience:  Commissioner Wood's office (him if possible), Kevin Madden, Don Gelinus, other key staff?
3.	Message:  Price in Production Area + Transport DOES NOT EQUAL Market Area Price
		      Financial Markets are Deriviatives of Physical Markets (You Can't Set Price By Financial Trading)
		      We are Portfolio traders and therefore can't ""identify"" supply and demand on each ""deal""
		      AVOID WESTERN GAS CRISIS DISCUSSION

If people agree, let's talk with commercial people today.

Jim

Pete,

Here is what the new Henry Hub swap would look like on the website.  Prior to this going live, I will need to run it by Mark Taylor in Legal.  Let me know what you think.

US Gas Daily     HHub Elec               Oct01           USD/MM

A financial Swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which the Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by Counterparty on the Website (the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Notional Quantity per Determination Period is the volume submitted multiplied by the number days in the relevant Determination Period.  The Payment Date(s) will be 5 business days after the Floating Price is determinable. The Floating Price shall be the average of the Index for each day in the relevant Determination Period.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the Website.
The Index for a day shall be the price published on such calendar day under the heading ""Electronic Trading Indices"" in the Henry Hub section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price used shall be the price published on the next succeeding Business Day.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per day.

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT 


Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a ""material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" it warned.

"CommodityLogic, Back-Office Commercialization and You","
Over the last several months, the CommodityLogic team has designed, built, and beta-tested a number of ""modules"" to create EnronOnline-type capabilities for the mid and back-office.  By combining these web-based solutions with the back-office commercialization effort, Enron can now offer its clients a complete suite of operational services unique in the industry.

Many of you have also created important pieces in this puzzle, and all of you have valuable client relationships.

We'd like to put all of these elements together.

Please join our team for a demonstration of the CommodityLogic modules and a discussion on strategy next Thursday, June 14, 2:30 to 3:30, 49C1. 

If I have excluded anyone from the invitation list that you feel should attend, please let me know.

Looking forward to seeing you next week.

All the best,

"Online Trading Simulation","We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

I've left a message on your voice mail, too.

I'm the editor of two UBS intranet sites where we post ""news"" stories
of interest to our employees. These sites are strictly internal.

I'm putting together a story about tomorrow's mock trading session and
need to speak with you -- and others you might suggest -- to get a
feeling for what's going on there.

I'm basically looking for you to describe the atmosphere describe a
picture of the scene to me.

Thanks, in advance, for all your help.

"RE: PIRA","Hunter/Fletch,

Danielle Marcinkowski in the market data group has been discussing a new arrangement with PIRA.  I was told by the legal group that all contracts with parties such as PIRA need to be negotiated through the market data group.  FYI there were outstanding issues in the bankruptcy surrounding the display of reports/data on our website to users that did not have licenses (mainly EGM).  

All that said, we need the Weekly Gas Flash, US Gas Market Forecast, Western Gas Basis Report, and the Daily Electricity report.  We would also like to be able to phone PIRA reps with questions, participate in strategic breifings, and have two slots for the PIRA annual energy conference.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris

Fellas,

Presto has asked me to be the contact to Allan Stewart at PIRA with regard to setting up an arrangement for their consulting services.  I'm currently having information-gathering discussions over services and fees for both gas and power, in both the east and west.  In order to fully incorporate everyone's needs into our arrangement with PIRA, I'll be contacting you this week to gather requests.  Or, if you know what you need, please just reply to me with the specific information.

Thanks,

Fletch

Please forward all PEC/NS/Aruba related documents to the attention of Kay Chapman with the estate.  This would include all transportation agreements, binders, etc.  If anyone has a full set/copy of the transportation agreements, please respond to this e-mail.  They need to go on a plane to Chicago later today.  We need to ensure these documents remain with the estate due to confidentiality provisions with PEC.

As always, thanks for your assistance.

Hunter,

As I mentioned this morning, since Zach McCarroll turned down the offer we would like to explore the possibility of keeping David Woodstrom on the IT team to fill the open position.  The Fundamentals IT team has been cut to a minimum support staff, and the addition of David would facilitate more development of fundamentals content.  David has been focusing on the operational capacity reporting (morning ops reports) by creating better ways to access the operational data (real time query tool vs. standard reports).  David also has been responsible for maintenance and development of the commodity fundamentals website since he joined the group in early 2000.  He built and maintains the current message board system used by gas trading and as well as the critical notice alerts for pipelines.  He has also worked closely with the West desk and Portland on various real time load and outage reports.  David Dronet and I both feel that the addition of David Woodstrom will allow the fundamentals team to continue producing innovative products instead of providing only support for current operations.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris

"MGU","Hunter...

I spoke with Louise on executing MGU.  She wants us all to sign the dash that I provided you yesterday and then I can sign the contract.

Of course the conversation went to value and I described the arrangement as such 1) Original mark to Russell of $2 MM - I described that the value would either a) fall out of the structure or b) you and I would determine another manner and 2) trading and origination would share the go forward value in the transaction as 60/40 unless you were required to create $2MM and then you would be covered on the monthly cost annuity first and then a sharing of 60% to you 40% to origination.  I emphasized the exercise of tracking this transaction against structure to determine the merits of our current analysis/internal process.

Attached is the dash for you to review and then call me with 1) your changes or 2) your approval.

Thanx,
Laura

"IHS Meeting","Hunter,

IHS
We met with IHS this morning to discuss the data that we need to complete our supply forecasts.  It is our intent to use the monthly historical production data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling permits to build a more accurate production forecast.  We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.  

In order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services from IHS:

	US Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly
	US Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly

Next year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.  We will be able to do this after we build the historical well information into our supply forecast.

Danielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.  She anticipated having the contract today, and sending it to Chicago for approval.

PIRA
Danielle is working to finalize the agreement in the next 3 days.  I gave her a list of the services that we needed, and told her that we would like to distribute the PIRA material on the Commodity Fundamentals website instead of having individual user accounts.  Based on the services that I think we'll need (North Americal Natural Gas, North American Electricity, and the Daily Demand Forecast), our combined cost for Gas and Power in Houston, Portland, Calgary, and Toronto should be around $100,000 for 100 users.  Danielle is going to send an e-mail when she has the final price.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris

"RE: how did your meeting w/ the lawyers go?","Hunter, the meeting went well. We met with Bryan Murtagh (UBS attorney) and did an overview of the contract services we are looking to set up with the pipes, how those are utilized and some of the underlying risks/exposure of using these contracts. Basically the message was these are non-negotiable contracts, he seemed to understand that and didn't indicate this would require any major legal review from their side. We also had a discussion about the credit requirements and what some of the pipes are asking for. Follow up credit meeting to take place today to get into some greater detail and get a standard credit package together. Also UBS did indicate that they also want to do a credit review of the pipes before moving forward. To faciltiate that we gave them a list of the Day 1 pipes to start their process.

In summary, I don't believe there will be any challenge on us entering into these agreements nor a lenghty review by the UBS attorneys. The credit issue is big, need to have them expedite their review of pipelines and also recognize our need to satisfy the pipeline credit requirments for a new customer (standard credit package and any addtional requirements). Also need some defintitive answers on when we can actually send this information out (is it now or is it when the deal closes). Suzanne is going to a legal meeting this AM to discuss/recap where everything is at this point in time. I will forward any additonal information to you when I get it. This assumes the Power of Attorney issue will be settled shortly for contract execution.

"TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : January 14, 2002
TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions 
While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. 
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. 
Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. 
Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. 
TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. 
The pipeline has told the NEB that ""with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade."" Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that ""unconventional gas"" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in ""tight"" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas ""is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions."" At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. 
In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections, the pipeline says only that ""if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations, these sources may start contributing supply this decade."" 
In a separate toll case before the NEB, TransCanada predicts it will be 2008 before northern gas -- from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska -- begins to flow south. An announcement Jan. 14 by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp. suggested that TransCanada's educated guesswork is on the money. After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities, the group -- Imperial Oil, Conoco Canada, Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada -- declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage. Next comes the ""project definition phase,"" or $200-$250 million in technical, environmental, commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field, gas-gathering and pipeline facilities. 
Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in 2003. The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu, Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send 1.2-1.5 Bcf/d south to northwestern Alberta. The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanada's system. 
TransCanada is in step with the group's expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond 2003 to collect approvals and build the project. The pipeline company's forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually, going from a starting rate at 500 MMcf/d in 2008 to 900 MMcf/d in '09, 1.1 Bcf/d in 2010, 1.2 Bcf/d in 2011 and 1.4 Bcf/d by 2012. The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow, however. 
As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the 1970s for production from Prudhoe Bay. In the documents before the NEB, TransCanada says it ""recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics, timing, routing and scope. It's unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas.""

Per our discussion this morning - two further items needed to complete my end of this transition of the weather team:

1)	A contact number for The Weather Channel - (770) 226-0000.  It's a switchboard number but they do have a dial by name directory - that's how I get anybody I know there.  The 2 names:  Dr. Steve Lyons and Kevin Stenson.

2)	My internet explorer bookmarks can be found at O:/Research/Bennett/Favorites.

My understanding is that this is all you guys need from me to complete my part of this transition.  Please confirm this - and let me know if/what you still need me to do.  To avoid confusion - please respond to everyone on the list above so that we can ensure that HR continues to be in the loop with this effort.

Sorry about the confusion but please let me know what further I can do - or if you are satisfied please confirm that there is nothing further that you need.

"Trading Track meeting on Tuesday","Hunter,

I will be out of the office on Monday and Tuesday meeting with the EIA in Washington D.C. so I will miss the Tuesday afternoon Trading Track meeting.  I think Biliana should spend a few more months in the fundamentals group since she has only been here since mid-February.  She has also expressed an interest in spending 2-3 months more in the group, and she could benefit from learning about the pipelines in the STP group.  

We lose Virawan (Aug 1st), Mat (Aug 1st), and Denver (Sep 1st).

We get Bilal Bajwa (Jul 1st) and Jason Wolfe (Sep 1st)

We could use two additional Trading Track Analysts/Associates in Jul/Aug to fill out the fundamentals group.  If we don't get the people from the Trading Track, I will have to recruit them from the Assoc/Analyst pool.

Let me know if you have any questions.

"Quick Question","Hunter,

Thanks again for the Coffee.  I really enjoyed hearing your take on the industry and actually I really enjoyed your interview as well.  I love to debate - especially economic theory/politics - which made your interview amazing to me.  

Quick Question, I apologize for not having a pen when we grabbed coffee.  I'm having difficulty remembering the books you recommended.  Would you remind again?

Jason

"Final Benefits Memo","

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

Currently, I am a Commercial Director working for Greg Piper in the estate.  I am contacting you regarding your potential need for individuals with strong trading, risk management, commercial and negotiation skills and expertise.  

The following bullet points my skill sets:

Proprietary Trading and P&L management responsibilities: Natural Gas (responsible for all financial, physical, futures and options nat gas trading in my region)
Demand side risk management:  Natural Gas (Managed price and logistical risk for 120 production facilities in North America)
Extensive and long-term industry contacts
Highly rated (Enron PRC process):  Commercial Director
Strong negotiation skills 

Prior to recent events, Fletch Sturm approached me to trade power for Enron.  If you have any interest in discussing this further, I will send you my resume and set up a time to talk.  

Sincerely,

Mike Bridges
