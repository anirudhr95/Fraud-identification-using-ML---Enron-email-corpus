"CBS SPORTSLINE.COM FANTASY FOOTBALL NEWSLETTER","
[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  October 19, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox at the end of every week. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Fantasy Football Matchups   ? Customize Reports to Display the Info You Want   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Fantasy Football Matchups     Every Friday our Fantasy experts break down the key Fantasy matchup of the week. It may be a top running back facing a sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a  premier cover-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense with ball-hawking safeties. We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups in every NFL game to  help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check our  Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar)  Fridays for Fantasy Football Matchups.  	


    Customize Reports to Display the Info You Want     Did you know you can customize the settings of most reports  on the site, and save those settings so they are displayed  each time you visit the report? For example, suppose you'd  like the Transactions, View report to display only Add/Drops  over the past 7 days for all teams. Enter those settings,  click GO and then click the Save icon displayed over the  report. Now each time you click Transactions, View on the toolbar, the report is displayed according to your custom  settings. After you click Save you can click the E-Rept icon to have your new custom report e-mailed to you on the days you choose.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answer - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied.  	


  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game.  	


  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player.  	


    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.

[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  November 23, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

"RE: Franchise Players and the Draft","
I don't see the need to mix franchise and non-franchise on the first round.
We're trying to get less confusing - not more.  What we do not need is some
major change in the draft methodology 2 days before the draft.

The system that Kevin initially described is the fairest, least confusing
and works fine.  The franchise keepers (including me) should pick after
those that do not keep anyone.    It best simulates the outcome of a
non-franchise snake draft.  Assuming the franchise keepers retain picks 1
through 5 of  a true first round, they would naturally pick last in a
second round.  This system worked fine last year.

Dutch and Jeff have brought up ranking the franchise players instead of a
2nd random drawing for franchise keepers.  I would vote for that (even
though I would pick last in the 1st round - 28th pick!).  There are
questions with players that might have been injured part of the year or
otherwise, but at least you know exactly where you stand.

I believe in using the snake draft and a 2nd drawing for franchise keepers,
but I would be fine with ranking the franchise players based on prior year.

Jeff Smith is just whining because he kept (potentially) the 10th overall
player in Manning and would now potentially has Manning and the 28th pick.
This is a large sacrifice, but this is Jeff's fault not the system.  Look
at the other 4 franchise players - they are all in the top 5 in most draft
rankings.  Only Smith is complaining.

Considering the state of the Redskins' defense, we'd suggest starting Muhammad despite his injury.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 10/19/01 Weinke missed a portion of practice on Thursday due to a thigh bruise. However, Head Coach Geroge Seifert expects his rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. The matchup ! ag! ainst the 'Skins is a good one for Weinke, who should receive starting consideration from Fantasy owners.   Rob Moore , WR ARI  Updated 10/19/01 Moore (hamstring) missed practice on Thursday and has been downgraded for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He'll likely miss yet another week of action, so keep him on reserve if he's currently on your roster.   Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 10/19/01 McNair is listed as questionable (shoulder) for Sunday's game against the Lions but is expected to play. Look for him to score a touchdown by either running the ball in or throwing.   Eddie George  , RB TEN  Updated 10/19/01 George is listed as questionable on the injury report with an ankle injury but is expected to play Sunday against Detroit. Look for George to have a big game against the struggling Lions.   Travis Taylor , WR BAL  Updated 10/19/01 Look for Taylor to catch several passes this week and snag at least one touchdown pass. He has become one of Elvis Grbac's favorite targets inside the red zone.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL  Updated 10/19/01 Ismail will catc! h ! a few passes this week but don't expect him to score any touchdowns. He has just two TD receptions in five games.   Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE  Updated 10/19/01 Northcutt has been getting a lot of practice in the No. 2 receiver slot and might fill-in for the injured Quincy Morgan as a starter. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout.    Trent Green , QB KC  Updated 10/18/01 The Chiefs might depend on the run, so Green's numbers may be limited. Expect one TD pass, but his yardage numbers will be modest.  Ken Dilger , TE IND  Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard , TE IND  Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND  Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year.! E! xpect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND  Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND  Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Pe! yt! on Manning , QB IND  Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB  Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wedne! sd! ay with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.   Terry Glenn , WR NE  Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE  Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ  Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.  Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ  Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ  Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point ! of! the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS  Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS  Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS  Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ  Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS  Updated 10/18/01! Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS  Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL  Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your! s! tarting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL  Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.

However, coach Marty Mornhinweg stated that Stewart is making progress, and is getting closer to returning to action.   Marco Battaglia , TE CIN  Updated 11/18/01 Battaglia (appendectomy) is out at least a month, and may miss the rest of the season. The big tight end has no real value as a Fantasy player.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC  Updated 11/18/01 Brunell (quadriceps) will start on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He'll be facing a tough Steelers' secondary at less than 100 percent, however, so Fantasy owners may want to consider benching him in Week 10.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC  Updated 11/18/01 Taylor (groin) practiced without incident on Friday, but he still needs medical clearance before he can play in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Even is he is able to play, however, he'd only be used on a limited basis. Stacey Mack will get the start in any event, so playing Taylor on your Fantasy team is not a wise move. !   Jerome Pathon , WR IND  Updated 11/18/01 Pathon (foot) is out for Sunday's game against New Orleans, according to the Indianapolis Star. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon's place once again.   James Jackson , RB CLE  Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) will likely be a gametime decison on Sunday against Baltimore. If the rookie tailback is unable to play, Jamel White will be Cleveland's featured back with Benjamin Gay getting some looks in the backfield as well.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI  Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BAL  Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN  Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  St! ev! e McNair , QB TEN  Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL  Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI  Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO  Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO  Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapol! is! defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO  Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a De! nv! er defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsi! st! ent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL  Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL  Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had! a! few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR  Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

He is still expected to start in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury.   Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend against Carolina! . ! He won't make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Third World Countryman Updated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.   Packers , DT GB - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/19/01 Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties in Butler's absence.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tenne! ss! ean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Xtreme Updated 11/19/01 Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day.   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods Updated 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Third World Countryman Updated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updat! ed! 11/19/01  Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jackson , RB CLE - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantasy value might drop greatly. Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/19/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting l! in! eup when Dallas faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - KMB Express Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. ! Ol! andis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Countryman Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - She Said Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Cali Bound Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Pumpdog Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consid! er! Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third World Countryman Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Baby Blues Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"RE: Franchise Players","
Hey,  did you ever respond back to Ty message about the expansion team  issue?
 
Looks  like my original counterpart has decided to pass on participating this year  and I don't have enough time/$ to do it on my own.  I've already met  with Ty and we're planning to team together this year because we're both in  the same situation.  
 
However, that means you've now got an open spot.   were you planning to fill it with another team?
 
Jody

Subject: Franchise  Players
The draft is almost here.  I will be sending  out directions either today or sometime tomorrow on how to get there.  It  is this Saturday at 11 am.  If you are keeping a franchise player, I need  a name now.  If we do not hear anything by tomorrow, then we will assume  none will be kept.  So far the list of franchise players  are:
 
Michael Deluke - Marshall Faulk
Jeff Ullrich - Kurt Warner
Michael Currie - Edgerrian James
 
That is it.
 
Let me know.
 
Later,
Kevin

"","With the daily chaos that ensues on this floor, sometimes communication is sacrificed.  Fortunately, we have the message board to facilitate real time sharing of information.  I think all of us, including myself, underutilize this tool.  I want to encourage everybody to keep the board open on their computers all day long.  In addition, I want everybody to post at least one message every day.  This can be an interesting trade that just happened, what counterparties are trying to do, new information you uncovered, etc.  Information we learn can be very valuable to other desks and it is only fair that if we're taking info from the board, we should be contributing as well.

Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending.

Dutch,

This is the same volume I got a quote from you last week -EEX - Bobwest VPP unwind.

I need your offer on the indicated volume.

Please provide the quote as of Friday night's close (not a current quote).  I think last time you said just use $.02 above mid.

Eric

Player Updates Scouting Reports  [IMAGE]'); [IMAGE]  Latest NFL Player News  Todd Heap , TE BAL  Updated 10/18/01 Heap practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland. Reserve Heap on your roster this week. It would be wise to keep him inactive until he is effective in a game.   Jeff Garcia , QB SF  Updated 10/18/01 According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealing with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other ! na! gging bumps and bruises. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. 28 against Chicago.   Peerless Price , WR BUF  Updated 10/18/01 Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF  Updated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.  Larry Centers , RB BUF  Updated 10/18/0!  Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE Jay Riemersma.  Drew Bledsoe , QB NE  Updated 10/18/01 There's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this week .     Bledsoe was upgraded from ""out"" to ""doubtful"" on the injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined.   Bledsoe's progress has been slower than he hoped and there's no timetable for his return.      Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK  Updated 10/18/01 Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of an injured right knee.          ""Tyrone Wheatley has a second degree - I don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,""' coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday.   Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progressed.   He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks.   ""I would not agree with that at this time,"" Gruden said.     Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 10/18/01 Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain whether he will play in ! Wa! shington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke cannot play.   Brian Griese , QB DEN  Updated 10/18/01 Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's confident he'll play Sunday against San Diego.   Griese complained of shoulder soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks defensive end Lamar King.   Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his shoulder.     Redskins , DT WAS  Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected! t! o play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI  Updated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised if his status is downgraded over the next two days.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR  Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR  Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL  Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL  Updated 10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense d! ur! ing practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN  Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI  Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN  Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC  Updated 10/17/01  McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET  Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team. Larry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Water Boys Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Money Shots Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - The Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to p! os! t solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - The Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Lak! e ! Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Water Boys Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Dallas De! mo! n Horde Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Barking Spiders Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley  , RB CAR - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Water Boys Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Water Boys Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - The Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.

He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Xtreme Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy ri! sk! because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - She Said Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right no! w.!   Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Cali Bound Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Hillrods Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hillrods Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - She ! Sa! id Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Hillrods Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Third World Countryman Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Baby Blues Updated 1! 1/! 25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent! Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/25/01Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Pumpdog Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught fo! ur! passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Baby Blues Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - KMB Express Updated 11/25/01 Muhamm! ad! missed Sunday's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

That idea is the best I've heard so far.  And this thing about not voting
this year is crap because if enough people have issues about something it
should be voted on for this year.  It's not like it would be a major problem
to implement such a system for this year as you've already said we'll come
with two systems on Saturday.  This is what email is for - why can't we have
a vote on email between today and tomorrow and have a decision before
Saturday.

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

"Re: Thursday Game - Transaction Notice","Anthony Wright doesn't cut it?  btw, I have decided that Garner is too
valuable a player to my team and thus have rescinded my offer for your
injured Pathon.  We are looking most forward to kicking your ass this week.

Subject: Re: Thursday Game - Transaction Notice


since there are only 4 of us that seem to check the message board
then i will try my luck here:

i've got 4 talented receivers in holt, pathon, muhammed & t. taylor.  i need
to establish more than 8 points over 5 weeks from my rb position.  to date
i have received offers like pinkston, price, garner, mack or allen and
flutie.  is it getting this bad where i'm actually considering these guys
just
to spawn some new life into my team????  i certainly need rb help but
could use a back up qb as well.

>>> ""Kevin"" <klyn@pdq.net> 10/16/01 08:49AM >>>
All transactions must be completed by this Thursday at 9am due to the game
on Thursday night.  After the game starts on Thursday, no transactions will
be accepted.  For players that are playing in the game on Thursday, please
remember to change your lineups before the game to include or exclude them.
You can still make changes to your lineup after Thursday for players that do
not play in the game on Thursday.

Thanks,

Kevin

He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game.    Derrick Alexander  , WR KC - CYSWC Updated 10/25/01   Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets.    James Hodgins  , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy.     Dave Stachelski  , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards.     Michael Bennett  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week.     Todd Heap  , TE BAL - Money Shots Updated 10/25/01   Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week.     Anthony Thomas  , RB CHI - Team T-Bone Updated 10/25/01   Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report.     Kevin Swayne  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy.     Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle. He is still recovering from a foot injury.     Terry Allen  , RB BAL - The Replacements Updated 10/25/01   Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive.     Jason Brookins  , RB BAL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/25/01   Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday. He might actually start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen. Nevertheless, he is listed as probable on the injury report.     Shannon Sharpe  , TE BAL - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/25/01   Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury report.     Freddie Jones  , TE SD - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/25/01   Jones has a sprained ankle but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as questionable on the injury report.     Hines Ward  , WR PIT - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/25/01   Ward missed practice Wednesday because of a foot injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed on the injury report as probable.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/25/01   Galloway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's practice. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the Cowboys' previous game.     Charlie Batch  , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detroit Free Press reports that he is still expected to play Sunday against the Bengals.     O.J. McDuffie  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury.     Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/25/01   Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out because of broken ribs.     Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/25/01   Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting lineup.     Terry Glenn  , WR NE - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/25/01   Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday.     Drew Bledsoe  , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills.     Chad Morton  , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain.     Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit.     Chad Johnson  , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence.     Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated 10/25/01   Wheatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Contra Costa Times that he is making progress. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Eagles.     Keyshawn Johnson  , WR TB - Money Shots Updated 10/25/01   Johnson ran in the morning and afternoon but did not practice Wednesday, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Johnson is recovering from hip and thigh injuries but is expected to play Sunday.     Jacquez Green  , WR TB - Barking Spiders Updated 10/25/01   Green is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Minnesota. He is recovering from a groin strain. Frank Murphy will replace Green at receiver if he is unable to play.     Warrick Dunn  , RB TB - Team T-Bone Updated 10/25/01   Dunn participated in running drills Wednesday and did not have any setbacks in his recovery from a toe injury, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Nevertheless, Dunn is still listed as questionable for this week's game against Minnesota.

We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	


  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	


  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	


    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

"RE: Franchise Players and the Draft","
As the  creator of the algebraic mean sequenced draft order that was built to eliminate  the inherent advantage that the #1 & #14 teams had by getting back to back  picks every other round, I think the time for mathematical preciseness has  passed.  I'm all for going to a simplified traditional snake system.   Frankly, at this point I think there are as many disadvantages to being 1 or 14  (or 2 - 13) as advantages that it all works itself out.  Hell, if it makes  preparing for the draft any easier (or administering the league), I'm for  it!
 
PS -  I'm for keeping TE's too!

Subject: Franchise Players and the Draft
The following is the list of franchise players  that have been kept:
 
Grant Johnson - Eddie George
Jeff Smith - Peyton Manning
Michael Deluke - Marshall Faulk
Michael Currie - Edgerrian James
Jeff Ullrich - Kurt Warner
 
I know this was brought up last year and we kind  of decided much of nothing...but does anyone object to going to a snake system  for the draft.  1-14, 14-1 for the whole draft?  We will still have  a supplemental round for those that do not keep franchise players.  Then  the non-franchise teams will pick in opposite order of the supplemental round  for round one...thus if you pick first in the supplemental round, you will  pick last (for those that did not keep franchise players) in the first  round.  Then, the teams that kept franchise players will be randomly  selected to pick at the end of the first round.  After the first round,  the draft will snake back the other way with the last pick in the first round  getting the first pick in the second round and the draft will continue in this  snake order until the end of the draft.  Let me know what you think or if  you are confused.
 
See everyone at the draft!!! 
 
Kevin

"Re: Thursday Game - Transaction Notice","since there are only 4 of us that seem to check the message board
then i will try my luck here:

i've got 4 talented receivers in holt, pathon, muhammed & t. taylor.  i need
to establish more than 8 points over 5 weeks from my rb position.  to date
i have received offers like pinkston, price, garner, mack or allen and
flutie.  is it getting this bad where i'm actually considering these guys just
to spawn some new life into my team????  i certainly need rb help but
could use a back up qb as well.

>>> ""Kevin"" <klyn@pdq.net> 10/16/01 08:49AM >>>
All transactions must be completed by this Thursday at 9am due to the game on Thursday night.  After the game starts on Thursday, no transactions will be accepted.  For players that are playing in the game on Thursday, please remember to change your lineups before the game to include or exclude them.  You can still make changes to your lineup after Thursday for players that do not play in the game on Thursday.

Thanks,

Kevin

He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG  Updated 10/24/01 Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.  Joe Jurevi! ci! us , WR NYG  Updated 10/24/01 Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines.   Reggie Swinton , WR DAL  Updated 10/24/01 Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini an! d ! Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL  Updated 10/24/01 Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo.     Darrin Chiaverini , WR DAL  Updated 10/24/01 Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. ! He! is recovering from a left knee injury.   Raghib Ismail , WR DAL  Updated 10/24/01 Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.   Ricky Watters , RB SEA  Updated 10/23/01 According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when! h! e got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA  Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA  Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fan! ta! sy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ  Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA  Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA  Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC  Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND  Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND  Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN  Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in p! ra! ctice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB  Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI  Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in the game. ! At! this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN  Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN  Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN  Updated 10/23/01 D! ys! on is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.   Eddie George , RB TEN  Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN  Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC  Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC  Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his! s! tatus for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE  Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL  Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach ! Br! ian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL  Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"FW: Buffalo Theory of Beer","
  
  
  
BuffaloTheory of Beer 
The answer to one of life's great mysteries! I haven't heard anyone
explain this as well as the all wise Cliff Clavin, on the sitcom Cheers. One
afternoon at Cheers, Cliff Clavin was explaining the Buffalo Theory
to his buddy Norm... 
""Well ya see Norm, it's like this... A herd of buffalo can only move
as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the
slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural
selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health
of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest
members."" 
He continues: ""In much the same way, the human brain can only operate
as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we
all know, kills brain cells, but naturally it attacks the slowest and
weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer
eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient
machine.  That's why you always feel smarter after a few beers.""

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.

There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.

If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger , TE IND - The Wounded Ducks Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Pumpdog Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Leather Cheerios Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to ! st! art in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Third World Countryman Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB IND - KMB Express Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss  , WR MIN - Cali Bound Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Baby Blues Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE! -! The Hillrods Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - She Said Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Baby Blues Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a g! oo! d week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Third World Countryman Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/18/01  Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Count! ry! man Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Third World Countryman Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of th! e ! work at tight end now that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Pumpdog Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Cali Bound Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Xtreme Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/18/01 Canida! te! will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - The Hillrods Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - The Wounded Ducks Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be ! th! e more productive of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Xtreme Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Third World Countryman Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Friday on a first come first serve basis - by doing this you will eliminate
better teams from ever picking up players - since on Monday it goes back to
reverse order etc.  Deluke do you concur. Why can't a message be posted on
Friday morning of all players dropped?

"wsex website pres lives in Antigua- not bad","Improving odds in online gambling
By William Spain, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 11:20 AM ET Jan. 31, 2002




Some sites safer than others for betting the Super
Bowl

CHICAGO (CBS.MW) - Fear flying to Vegas? Can't find a
friend to cover the spread? Just longing to get some
action on the Big Game?

Don't sweat: There's still time to bypass the bookie
for a browser.

While credit-card issuers are making it harder for
Americans to lay money down online for Super Bowl
XXXVI (See full story), there are plenty of Web-based
sportsbooks ready, willing and able to take their
wagers.

The trick is figuring out which sites to trust - and
to make sure a winning hunch gets paid off in full and
on time.

The sheer number of operators, along with their
quasi-legal status and offshore locations, complicates
that task. But following a few simple rules can
drastically decrease the odds of being victimized by a
welshing Webmaster.

""I would never, ever, play at a casino or sportsbook
that doesn't have their phone number available.""

Eric Morris,publisher, Online Gambling Magazine


By most accounts, the majority of Internet gambling
sites are run honestly. Like the brick-and-mortar
casinos they often compete with, the sites don't have
to cheat to make money. And while there have been
instances of bettors getting stiffed, it's far more
likely to occur due to incompetence rather than
deliberate rip-off.

The very first thing to look at before placing any bet
online, industry experts seem to agree, is whether the
site has actual human beings readily on hand to answer
questions, try to resolve disputes, etc.

""I would never, ever, play at a casino or sportsbook
that doesn't have their phone number available,"" said
Eric Morris, publisher of Online Gambling Magazine.

Spot checks

Next, do the research. Check the message boards at
review sites like winneronline and casinomeister to
see what is being said about who and why. Crooks and
cretins alike can get called to account pretty fast in
cyberspace; if people are complaining about a specific
site, stay away.

Morris also recommends that players ""stay with sites
that are advertising in multiple publications and
newspapers"" instead of just using cheap or no-cost
online banners. With that kind of marketing
investment, ""chances are they are legitimate and will
pay you out.""

Sue Schneider, chief executive of River City Group, an
interactive gambling research, publishing and
brokerage firm, echoed Morris' sentiments about what
consumers should check before placing an online bet
for the first time. To the list, she adds ""they should
see if a site is licensed by a specific government and
if it has a 'Seal of Approval' from the Interactive
Gaming Council.""

Although betting sites operate in some European
countries and Australia, they will not usually take
wagers from people in the U.S. Among the
multinationals currently getting a taste of that
action are Playboy Enterprises(PLA: news, chart,
profile), Sun International (SIH: news, chart,
profile) and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. (NWS: news,
chart, profile)

Top jurisdictions

While it's not actually illegal as yet for Americans
to make bets online, the issue is such a political hot
potato here that regulators in other industrialized
nations have taken a pass on the market for now.

Meanwhile, formal regulations for South-of-the-Border
operators vary from the relatively stringent and
recently upgraded, in Antigua, to the virtually
non-existent, in Costa Rica.

Frank Catania, head of an interactive gambling
consultancy that bears his name, is a former director
of gaming enforcement for New Jersey - the nation's
No. 2 casino market after Nevada. He describes himself
as a proponent of ""player protection"" via strict
regulations.

Players ""need to look for a site that comes from a
jurisdiction with significant gaming regulation"" he
said, and named Antigua as the best of the Caribbean
-- in no small part because he helped draw their
rulebook. He says other good sites are run out of
Australia, the Isle of Man and from a Mohawk Indian
reservation in Canada.

In these locales, at least, ""a consumer can feel
relatively safe that they are going to get paid,"" he
said.

Steve Schillinger is director of wagering at World
Sports Exchange. Based in Antigua, it's one of the
most-established online bookmakers, up and running
since 1996. Schillinger claims a customer base of
30,000 and says ""on a typical Sunday in football
season, we process over 200 bets a minute.""

Ways around

Schillinger says his company hasn't experienced any
problems with credit cards yet, but that it's still
easy to bet should your issuer balk. There are other
ways to set up an account, including wire transfers.

Winnings typically are sent via overnight mail, he
says, and can be considerable: World Sports Exchange's
limit is $20,000 per bet and people will sometimes
make as many as five bets on a single game.

""Business for us is very good,"" he said. ""We increase
about 50 percent in volume every year.""

Those kind of numbers are one of the main factors that
have some U.S. casino companies panting for a piece of
the action. The management of MGM Mirage (MGG: news,
chart, profile)is among the industry's more outspoken
boosters of the potential of online gambling.

Their counterparts at archrival Park Place (PPE: news,
chart, profile) are more low-key about it, but they've
also indicated they don't intend to be left behind.
Their theory is, when Vegas operators enter the
business, they'll grab market share and greatly
expanding the pie by providing bettors with U.S.-based
brand name service.

They also could leverage their existing databases to
drive business and use a ""comp"" system to reward
players with free rooms, trips to Las Vegas and other
cherished amenities.

That may pose something of challenge to sites like
Schillinger's - if it ever happens. In the meantime,
he asks with obvious self-interest, ""Where is your
safer bet? With a local bookmaker or a reputable
online company that pays everybody?""

Anyone care to wager on that one?

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"Online Launch Plan Update","With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Hillrods Updated 10/21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games this year and has become a m! aj! or scoring threat even though he is not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She Said Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - She Said Updated 10/21/01 Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - The Hillrods Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Cali Bound Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - KMB Express Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Hillrods Updated 10/2! 1/! 01 Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - The Hillrods Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Xtreme Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) st! ar! ted Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - KMB Express Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - The Leather Cheerios Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 ! ya! rds and a TD at Detroit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.  Eddie George , RB TEN - The Wounded Ducks Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Pumpdog Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Xtreme Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO - Third World Countryman Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falc! on! s. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - She Said Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third World Countryman Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht , TE NYJ - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Baby Blues Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

The Raiders plan to use him if Tyrone Wheatley is unable to play. But don't expect Kirby to get a lot of touches. Oakland will likely rely on Charlie Garner instead.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK  Updated 10/26/01   Wheatley missed practice again on Thursday because of wrist and knee injuries. He remains questionable for Sunday's game. Terry Kirby will replace him in the rotation if he is unable to play.     Damon Jones  , TE JAC  Updated 10/26/01   Jones, recovering from a shoulder injury, returned to practice Thursday. He might remains questionable for this week's game but might see some action.      Shannon Sharpe  , TE BAL  Updated 10/26/01   Sharpe has been downgraded on the injury report from probable to qyestionable. He has been limited in practice all week because of a leg injury. Rookie Todd Heap might get a lot of looks on offense but he is also recovering from injury. The Ravens may be forced to use tight end John Jones.     Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND  Updated 10/26/01   Wilkins missed Thursday's game at Kansas City. He was held out of the lineup because of broken ribs.      Jerome Pathon  , WR IND  Updated 10/26/01   Pathon missed his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. He was replaced by rookie Reggie Wayne in the starting lineup.      Drew Bledsoe  , QB NE  Updated 10/26/01   It doesn't appear that Bledsoe will be used as an emergency QB Sunday, but The Boston Herald reports that doctors will make a decision on whether on not to increase his workload. Bledsoe has thrown 75 passes in the past two days without experiencing any adverse affects.     Elvis Joseph  , RB JAC  Updated 10/26/01   Joseph might replace Stacey Mack as the starting back this Sunday, according to The Florida Times-Union . Mack has made two critical mistakes in the past two games. Joseph has been getting a lot of carries this week and has already been slated to be the third-down back. We wouldn't advise using either player this week if you already have two solid backs.     Stacey Mack  , RB JAC  Updated 10/26/01   Mack might be replaced in the starting lineup by rookie Elvis Joseph, according to The Florida Times-Union . The Jaguars are reportedly looking to use Joseph because of the mistakes Mack has made in the past two games. Consider reserving Mack this week.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL  Updated 10/26/01   Galloway was limited in practice once again Thursday because of a foot injury. The Dallas Morning News reports that he will be a gametime decision.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL  Updated 10/26/01   Swinton practiced Thursday an is expected to play Sunday, according to The Dallas Morning News . Swinton had been limited for most of the week because of a hamstring injury.     Michael Bennett  , RB MIN  Updated 10/26/01   Don't expect Bennett to return to the starting lineup soon. He is listed as questionable on the injury report but probably won't return until after the Vikings' bye in Week Eight.     Jacquez Green  , WR TB  Updated 10/26/01   Green was limited in practice Thursday because of a groin injury. He remains questionable for Sunday's game and will be re-evaluated on Saturday.     Warrick Dunn  , RB TB  Updated 10/26/01   Dunn was limited in practice Thursday because of his hamstring injury and remains questionable for Sunday's game. He will be re-evaluated on Saturday.     Keyshawn Johnson  , WR TB  Updated 10/26/01   Johnson was upgraded from questionable to probable Thursday. He is suffering from hip and thigh injuries but was able to run for the second consecutive day. Johnson is expected to play in Sunday's game.      Hines Ward  , WR PIT  Updated 10/26/01   Ward (ankle) was limited in practice Thursday, according to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette . He is still expected to play in Monday's game against Tennessee.     Terry Glenn  , WR NE  Updated 10/26/01   The Patriots will reportedly bench Glenn once again this week if he doesn't show any improvement in practice Friday. Glenn is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game.      Rod Smith  , WR DEN  Updated 10/26/01   Smith is listed as probable on the injury report. He is suffering from an ankle injury but is expected to start Sunday's game against New England.     Chris Weinke  , QB CAR  Updated 10/26/01   Weinke is suffering from a hip injury but is expected to start Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury report.     Shane Matthews  , QB CHI  Updated 10/26/01   Matthews is suffering from sore ribs but is expected to be the No. 2 QB Sunday. He is listed as probable on the injury report.     Terry Allen  , RB BAL  Updated 10/26/01   Allen practiced Wednesday but was too sore to work out Thursday. He remains questionable for Sunday's game but The Washington Post claims that it is almost certain Allen will be replaced by Jason Brookins.     Anthony Wright  , QB DAL  Updated 10/26/01   Not only is Wright out for the season, he might need season-ending surgery to repair his damaged knee. An MRI showed that he damaged the same ACL that was repaired in five years ago.     Marshall Faulk  , RB STL  Updated 10/26/01   Head coach Mike Martz has ruled Faulk out for Sunday's game, according to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch . Faulk is still recovering from a bruised knee so Trung Canidate will replace him as the starting running back once again.     Terrell Davis  , RB DEN  Updated 10/26/01   Bothered by soreness in his lower left leg and five weeks removed from surgery on his right knee, Davis practiced with the Broncos Thursday but remained questionable for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots. ""Hopefully there's no setback today and he just keeps on getting better and better,"" Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ""I anticipate or I'm hoping for the Monday night game [Nov. 5] there will be no setback this week, and he'll be ready to go.""  Shanahan did not rule Davis out for Sunday's game, but a Nov. 5 return seems more likely. Even if Davis does play this Sunday, Mike Anderson will probably get most of the carries.     Patrick Jeffers  , WR CAR  Updated 10/26/01   Jeffers, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during in a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2000, said he's been told by the coaching staff that he'll be activated Sunday for the first time this season. ""They said it looks like I'll be up, so I'm preparing like I will be,"" Jeffers said. ""I'm excited. It's another step along the way."" However, the Panthers may delay his return if injured receiver Steve Smith is able to play. Keep Jeffers reserved for now. He will see limited action if plays.     Ryan Leaf  , QB DAL  Updated 10/26/01   Leaf will be the Cowboys' backup QB Sunday. Clint Stoerner has been named the starter in place of the injured Anthony Wright.     Clint Stoerner  , QB DAL  Updated 10/26/01   Stoerner will start at quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys against Arizona on Sunday, replacing Anthony Wright, who is out with a chronic sprained knee and could face season-ending surgery. We wouldn't advise using Stoerner as the starting QB on your Fantasy squad. He has played just three games in his two seasons with Dallas, but was 4-of-7 for 44 yards and two touchdowns against Philadelphia this year. Ryan Leaf will be the No. 2 quarterback for Dallas.     Edgerrin James  , RB IND  Updated 10/26/01   James hyperextended his left knee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game but said his knee should be fine for the Colts' next game on November 4.     Derrick Alexander  , WR KC  Updated 10/25/01   Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets.    James Hodgins  , RB STL  Updated 10/25/01   Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy.

His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to! s! ee some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Countryman Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - She Said Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Cali Bound Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Pumpdog Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third World Countryman Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Baby Blues Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Cali Bound Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Marty Booker , WR CHI - Xtreme Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Hillrods Updated! 1! 1/18/01 Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - She Said Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hillrods Updated 11/18! /0!  Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Xtreme Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week.   Jerry Rice , WR OAK - Third World Countryman Updated 11/18/01 Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Cali Bound Updated 11/18/01 Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-start every week.  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/18/01 Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs and two interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes a go! od! backup RB right now.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/18/01 Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should not start for most Fantasy teams.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/18/01 Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some occasional TDs down the stretch.   Tim Couch , QB CLE - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/18/01 Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup right now.  Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 times for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and lateral quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB.   James Jackson , RB CLE - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White shared carries in his place.   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Xtreme Updated 11/18/01 Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless you lack depth at RB.  Chris Chambers , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01!  The rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets. Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

 CLICK FOR WAR 	WAR  Rules of the Game: In the basic game there are two players and you use a standard 52 card pack. Cards rank as usual from high to low: A K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. Suits are ignored in this game.  Deal out all the cards, so that each player has 26. Players do not look at their cards, but keep them in a packet face down. The object of the game is to win all the cards. Both players now turn their top card face up and put them on the table. Whoever turned the higher card takes both cards and adds them (face down) to the bottom of their packet. Then both players turn up their next card and so on. 	
 [IMAGE] 		
 CLICK FOR SLOTS 	SLOTS  The Odds: The result of each spin of the wheels is determined by a computer program that generates random results. This is true for both online slots games and slot machines found in hotel casinos. The machines can easily be set by the casino to generate whatever payout they choose. For example, they may set it to 95%. That means for every 100 dollars bet, the machine will, on average, pay out 95 dollars. The other five dollars goes to the casino and that's how they make their profit. Of course, that's just on average. It's possible, if Lady Luck is on your side, to make hundreds or even thousands of dollars with just one spin	
 [IMAGE] 		
 CLICK FOR ROULETTE 	ROULETTE  The Odds: With the 38-number American wheel, the house has a big 5.26 percent edge. (Whenever 0 or 00 are hit, all bets lose.) With the 37-number European wheel, the house advantage is 2.7 percent. In other words, on every $100 bet the house makes $2.70. With the en prison rule, this edge drops to just 1.35 percent. Obviously you want to look for casinos that offer the European, single-zero wheel -- and many online casinos do. If you can find one that also offers en prison, so much the better.	
 [IMAGE] 		
 CLICK FOR BLACKJACK 	BLACKJACK   Rules of the Game: Before any cards are dealt, the player must wager. He does this by placing his bet in the designated space in front of his table position. The dealer then deals two cards to each of the players, and two to himself (one of the dealer's cards is dealt face up and one is dealt facing down). Face cards (kings, queens and jacks) count as 10, ace counts as one or 11 (as the player chooses) and all other cards are counted at their face value.  If the player's first two cards are an ace and a 10 or face card, he wins. However, if the dealer also has a blackjack, it is a standoff, as are all ties or pushes. A winning blackjack pays the player 3 to 2.

This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.  Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Pumpdog Updated 11/26/01 Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in the second half of Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. He did not throw a touchdown pass for! t! he first time this season, however, and has been very inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper continues to struggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injury by Week 12.  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 It is unclear who will start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against Chicago, as Batch is still sore from strained groin muscles that limited him on Thursday. Mike McMahon has been getting most of the playing time when Batch can't go, but the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to the tough Bears secondary. We don't recommend any of the three for Week 12.  Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 The Cowboys announced Monday that Carter will replace Ryan Leaf as their starting quarterback for next Sunday's game against Washington. Carter started the first game of the season for Dallas, and is 10-for-24 for 38 yards and no touchdowns on the year. We don't recommend him in any league this season.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - The Hillrods Updated 11/26/01 Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Minnesota with a pulled right hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against Detroit. Keep an eye on his progress during practice this week before you make a final decision on him.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/26/01 Sanders is expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hamstring problem that limited him to the first two series of Sunday's game against San Diego. Check back on his status before making a final decision on him for Week 12.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - KMB Express Updated 11/26/01 Graham suffered a bruised thigh in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current status is day to day.  Jason Broo! k! ins  , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/26/01 Brookins may miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Baltimore will elevate Moe Williams into the starting role and use fullback Obafemi Ayanbadejo as a backup.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - The Hillrods Updated 11/26/01 Barlow dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has not been determined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/26/01 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury o! n ! Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/26/01 Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Xtreme U! pd! ated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - She Said Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Cali Bound Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passe! s ! for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Hillrods Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hillrods Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Hillrods Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Di! eg! o. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Third World Countryman Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Baby Blues Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catchin! g ! six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"Membership rewards announcement - Pls distribute 1/18/02","AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.

"Employee Meeting Postponed","We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Replacements Updated 10/23/01 According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down th! e ! stretch.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchu! p ! for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - High Shrivel Fac! to! r Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whet! he! r they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Team T-Bone Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11! c! arries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - CYSWC Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - High S! hr! ivel Factor Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Money Shots Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - The Replacements Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL -! S! outh Park Cows Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/23/01  According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing fo! r ! me because I was able to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

"NetcoOnline Launch Plans","
We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas


Definitions:
	
Password Application (PA) - Only document where a physical signature is required  by an authorized person (Master User)

Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) - Must be accepted online by the Master User before they can proceed into NetcoOnline

Master User - Typically the company authorized signatory that signed the Password Application. Establishes transaction rights for each trader (sub-users)

Sub-User - Trader, assigned either execute or read only status 

General Terms & Conditions (GTC) - Document that governs online trades unless a Master Agreement is in place

Master Agreement - Document that governs online and offline trades and supersedes the GTC

"CBS SPORTSLINE.COM FANTASY FOOTBALL NEWSLETTER","
[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  November 16, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remain! s ! a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - South Park Cows Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Money Shots Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, ! al! though his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Barking Spiders Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Water Boys Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage. !   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - CYSWC Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty goo! d ! weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Barking Spiders Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and ! tw! o TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held Mc! Na! bb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Barking Spiders Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Water Boys Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place o! f ! the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed Sunday's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - CYSWC Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - CYSWC Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - CYSWC Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a! r! ib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.

3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.

I talked to Rick's parents tonight about the  cause of Rick's death.  It was not anaphylactic shock.  According to  the autopsy report he died from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an enlarged  heart.  There is no word whether this is a condition he was born with or  something that developed later in life.  Rick never complained of any of  the symptoms listed and often sudden death is the first indication of the  disease.  I have attached a bit of material I found.  Please see that  this reaches as many people as possible.  I just don't want to  be  responsible for spreading the word right now.  Thanks.  If anyone has  any further information, please have them forward it to me if they  would.
 
Andrea

Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet.        Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/24/01   Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season.   ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said.   Davis admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.      Amani Toomer  , WR NYG - Team T-Bone Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert Emanuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.    Hines Ward  , WR PIT - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Team T-Bone Updated 10/24/01   The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB GB - Water Boys Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated 10/24/01   Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Robinson  , WR CHI - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Neil Rackers  , K CIN - South Park Cows Updated 10/24/01   According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.    Todd Pinkston  , WR PHI - The Replacements Updated 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.    Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury.     Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - The Replacements Updated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Trent Dilfer  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    Matt Hasselbeck  , QB SEA - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01   The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated 10/23/01   Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.    Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01   Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01   Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.    More Updates    Player News Teams   [IMAGE]   CYSWC Player News    Joe Nedney  , Active K Updated 10/23/01  Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.    Chris Chandler  , Reserve QB Updated 10/22/01  Chandler had another solid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and 39 yards. He also completed 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to be an adequate starter for the rest of the season.    Darnay Scott  , Active WR Updated 10/22/01  Scott suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss next week's game against Detroit.    J.R. Redmond  , Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01  Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.    Maurice Smith  , Active RB Updated 10/22/01  Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in the Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again until November 4.    Derrick Alexander  , Active WR Updated 10/21/01  Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him.    Desmond Clark  , Reserve TE Updated 10/21/01  Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.    Corey Dillon  , Active RB Updated 10/21/01  The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.    Derrick Mason  , Active WR Updated 10/21/01  Mason (ankle) is expected to start on Sunday against Detroit. With the Lions' secondary in shambles, starting Mason is a good decision for Fantasy owners with a thin group of receivers.    Jeff Garcia  , Active QB Updated 10/18/01  According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealing with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps and bruises. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. 28 against Chicago.    Antowain Smith  , Reserve RB Updated 10/18/01  Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.    Chad Lewis  , Active TE Updated 10/18/01  Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.    Antonio Freeman  , Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01  Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this week.    Raiders  , Active DT Updated 10/02/01  The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.    Bills  , Reserve DT Updated 09/30/01  Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday's game against Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist injury. He walked off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and his return is questionable.    Ricky Proehl  , Reserve WR Updated 08/19/01  Proehl has been dealing with a slight hamstring injury in recent days, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Proehl is expected to be ready for the start of the regular season.    Adam Vinatieri  , Reserve K Updated 12/13/00  Vinatieri has been one of the league's most accurate placekickers in recent weeks, converting on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his chances against the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense struggles like it did on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's elite kickers on your roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

DATE:

===========================================================

Please be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of changes to the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule that were recently approved by the Board will become effective.

Specifically, beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001 and continuing for subsequent Friday post-close sessions (and post-close sessions the day before a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:

(1)	Contract months eligible for trading in these sessions will be expanded from the first four to the first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)	The sessions will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)	The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil		20 ticks
Heating Oil 		50 ticks
Unleaded Gas 		50 ticks
Natural Gas		50 ticks

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.

AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.57(""POST-CLOSE TRADING SESSION"") AND
NYMEX RULE 6.57A (""END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION"")

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

Rule 6.57A.	 END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION

On the last trading day of the calendar week, and, in any week when an Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close trading session provided on the trading floor pursuant to Rule 6.57.  Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the ""End of Week Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of [ten (10)]  * five
 (5) * minutes in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the following conditions:

(A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first [four] * twelve * listed delivery months;

(B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable contract month for that futures contract * and as further expanded above the daily high and below the daily low only for the contracts listed below provided however that no such expanded trading range may exceed the price fluctuation limits in effect for the applicable contract as of the end of the RTH session:

Contract				Additional Ticks

Crude Oil				20 ticks
Natural Gas				50 ticks
Unleaded Gasoline			50 ticks
Heating Oil				50 ticks *

(C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be reported on public ticker services;

(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week Session shall not be considered in determining any settlement price; and

(F) Floor Members executing trades during the End of Week Session shall mark a line across their trading cards prior to the entry of an End of Week Session trade.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been ful! l ! speed at practice, however, so don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider be! nc! hing Muhammad if at all possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy! p! erspective.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week. Randy Moss , WR MIN - The Replacements Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Lake Austin Mighty Mullet! s ! Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/17/01 Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw ! fo! r over 200 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - The Replacements Updated 10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  ! He! rman Moore , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team. Larry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry , RB BUF - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.  Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - South Park Cows Updated 1! 0/! 17/01 The Buffalo News says the Bills want to get Riemersma more involved in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are healthy again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the year, but he will now become more involved in the passing game.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/17/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this week against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reggie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Herald says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with stress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning Star, Smith could end up splitting more carries with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each other very well, and that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/17/01 Alexa! nd! er underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to the injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionable, but he is expected to play.   Greg Clark , TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Clark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on his right hamstring three weeks ago. ""It was encouraging,"" Clark told the Contra Costa Times. ""I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of tha! t ! before the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I could do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in comparison."" Head Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game against Chicago.    More Updates  Player News Teams  [IMAGE]  CYSWC Player News  Derrick Alexander , Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Alexander overcame back problems to play against the Steelers, but was held to just one catch for 10 yards. Injuries and lack of effective complements have rendered Alexander a disappointment so far this season.  Darnay Scott , Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the Browns, but he scored on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scott in the passing game, even though the final numbers haven't always reflected it.  Antonio Freeman , Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this week.  Antowain Smith , Reserve RB Updated 10/14/01 Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win over San Diego, but he did score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantasy player, however, and is no better than a reserve used only when the matchup is right.   Derrick Mason , Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01 Mason (ankle and shoulder) has been declared inactive for Week Six. Justin McCareins or Chris Sanders should start in his place.  Maurice Smith , Active RB Updated 10/14/01 Smith rushed for 50 yards and a TD against the 49ers. Smith's yardage numbers won't be overwhelming the rest of the year, but he should continue to be a consistent TD threat.  Desmond Clark , Active TE Updated 10/12/01 Consider Clark as a starter this week. The Seahawks are soft over the middle and in the red zone, where Clark can be effective.  Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 10/12/01 Garcia (elbow) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta. He'll post solid numbers against an inconsistent Falcons' secondary, so be sure to start him this week.   Corey Dillon , Active RB Updated 10/12/01 Look for Dillon to have mixed success this week. The Browns defense will make it difficult to run but his effort as a receiver will be enough to give him a productive week.   J.R. Redmond , Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01 Redmond is questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego due to an ankle injury. He probably will miss this game due to the injury, which makes him virtually worthless Fantasy-wise.   Drew Bledsoe , Reserve QB Updated 10/02/01 According to the Boston Globe, there has been no upgrade in Bledsoe's timetable to return. He is still expected to miss the next two weeks, so keep Bledsoe on reserve until he is healthy enough to play again.   Raiders , Reserve DT Updated 10/02/01 The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   Bills , Active DT Updated 09/30/01 Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday's game against Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist injury. He walked off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and his return is questionable.   Chad Lewis , Reserve TE Updated 09/28/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers this week against Dallas. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Ricky Proehl , Reserve WR Updated 08/19/01 Proehl has been dealing with a slight hamstring injury in recent days, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Proehl is expected to be ready for the start of the regular season.   Joe Nedney , Active K Updated 03/07/01 The Tennessee Titans on Tuesday reached a contract agreement with Nedney, an unrestricted free agent who played most of the 2000 season with the Carolina Panthers. The five-year veteran will replace longtime Titans kicker Al Del Greco, who was cut last week after a poor postseason performance and for salary cap reasons. Nedney converted 26 of 28 field-goals attempts and all 20 of his extra-point tries for 98 points last season.   Adam Vinatieri , Reserve K Updated 12/13/00 Vinatieri has been one of the league's most accurate placekickers in recent weeks, converting on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his chances against the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense struggles like it did on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's elite kickers on your roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

I re-enabled his old system that went off last night.  Both systems will be
functional with the old one going off on April 30th.  If you need longer,
just let me know.  I have been putting the latest upgrades to allow both
systems to run for at least two weeks before cancellation of the old one.
If you would like that to be a 30 day parallel, then I can do that to be on
the safe side....actually I will just start doing that so that there is
plenty of time for the transition.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Boo Williams and Lamont Hall will split time at tight end in his absence.   Dez White , WR CHI - Team T-Bone Updated 11/18/01 White (ankle) will start Sunday's game. He still may not do much against the Tampa Bay defense.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Money Shots Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) did not start in Sunday's game. Jamel White started against the Ravens.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 11/18/01 McNair will start Sunday's game against Cincinnati as long after taking pre-game snaps without any problems. McNair, who is dealing with a thumb injury, isn't worth starting on your Fantasy team outside of deeper leagues.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Barking Spiders Updated 11/18/0!  Green (abdominal strain) is out for Sunday's game. Reidel Anthony will start in his absence.  James Stewart , RB DET - South Park Cows Updated 11/18/01 Stewart (ankle) is out for Sunday's game against Arizona. However, coach Marty Mornhinweg stated that Stewart is making progress, and is getting closer to returning to action.   Marco Battaglia , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Battaglia (appendectomy) has been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season. The ! bi! g tight end has no real value as a Fantasy player.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/18/01 Brunell (quadriceps) will start on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He'll be facing a tough Steelers' secondary at less than 100 percent, however, so Fantasy owners may want to consider benching him in Week 10.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/18/01 Taylor (groin) practiced without incident on Friday, but he still needs medical clearance before he can play in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Even is he is able to play, however, he'd only be used on a limited basis. Stacey Mack will get the start in any event, so playing Taylor on your Fantasy team is not a wise move.   Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/18/01 Pathon (foot) is out for Sunday's game against New Orleans, according to the Indianapolis Star. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon's place once again.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Money Shots Updated! 1! 1/18/01 Jackson (ankle) will likely be a gametime decison on Sunday against Baltimore. If the rookie tailback is unable to play, Jamel White will be Cleveland's featured back with Benjamin Gay getting some looks in the backfield as well.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Water Boys Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01!  According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Water Bo! ys! Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith  , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' ! ma! tchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Money Shots Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - The Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks  , QB NO - The Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Water Boys Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.

"RE: Franchise Players and the Draft","
Chris  don't do it!!! KEEP THE ALGEBRAIC MEAN SEQUENCED DRAFT ORDER.

Subject: RE: Franchise Players and the  Draft
As  the creator of the algebraic mean sequenced draft order that was built to  eliminate the inherent advantage that the #1 & #14 teams had by getting  back to back picks every other round, I think the time for mathematical  preciseness has passed.  I'm all for going to a simplified traditional  snake system.  Frankly, at this point I think there are as many  disadvantages to being 1 or 14 (or 2 - 13) as advantages that it all works  itself out.  Hell, if it makes preparing for the draft any easier (or  administering the league), I'm for it!
 
PS -  I'm for keeping TE's too!

Subject: Franchise Players and the  Draft
The following is the list of franchise players  that have been kept:
 
Grant Johnson - Eddie George
Jeff Smith - Peyton Manning
Michael Deluke - Marshall Faulk
Michael Currie - Edgerrian James
Jeff Ullrich - Kurt Warner
 
I know this was brought up last year and we  kind of decided much of nothing...but does anyone object to going to a snake  system for the draft.  1-14, 14-1 for the whole draft?  We will  still have a supplemental round for those that do not keep franchise  players.  Then the non-franchise teams will pick in opposite order of  the supplemental round for round one...thus if you pick first in the  supplemental round, you will pick last (for those that did not keep  franchise players) in the first round.  Then, the teams that kept  franchise players will be randomly selected to pick at the end of the first  round.  After the first round, the draft will snake back the other way  with the last pick in the first round getting the first pick in the second  round and the draft will continue in this snake order until the end of the  draft.  Let me know what you think or if you are confused.
 
See everyone at the draft!!! 
 
Kevin

However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effect! s ! of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Barking Spiders Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Water Boys Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Giants , DT NYG - The Replacements Updated 11/20/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - South Park Cows Updated 11/20/01 The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job,"" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star . He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Water Boys Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - South Park Cows Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expect! e! d to return to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues.   James Stewart , RB DET - South Park Cows Updated 11/20/01 Stewart (ankle) is hopeful that he can play returned to practice and may start Thursday's game against Green Bay. He will work his ankle extensively in practice prior to Thursday, and is optimistic that he'll be ready to play. If Stewart is able to go, he's worth starting in if you need a running back for Week 11.     Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/20/01 Taylor has been told by a medical specialist that he should not return to action this weekend against Pittsburgh. In fact, Taylor could be out for an even longer period of time than what was originally diagnosed. Taylor tore the groin muscle completely off the bone back in Week Two, which is an injury that normally takes about three months to heal. ""It's going to be very unfair for ! an! yone to assume he will play any time in the immediate future,"" said Taylor's agent, Drew Rosenhaus. ""He's just not healthy yet. He can't run full speed without tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a very good job in working him but he's still in pain."" Expect Stacey Mack and Elvis Joseph to continue splitting carries in Taylor's absence.    Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Emanuel is out for Thursday's game against Green Bay due to a sprained ankle. In fact, the injury is so bad that Emanuel may miss the remiander of the season, but no definitive word on his condition has been made by the team.  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/20/01 According to published reports, Muhammad's shoulder injury will likely keep him out of Sunday's game against Atlanta. That could mean big things for Donald Hayes and Issac Bryd, who'll start against a questionable Falcons secondary.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Team T-Bone Updated 11/20/01 Cleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'll likely be replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last week against Indianpolis.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 According to the Dallas Morning News, Carter expects to start on Dec. 2 against Washington. Carter, who has been out since October with a hamstring injury, will serve as the No. 3 quarterback on Thursday vs. Denver.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/19/01 Hilliard continues to feel some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe, and it is causing him to limp around a bit. He is still expected to start in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury.   Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend against Carolina. He won't make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - CYSWC Updated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.   Packers , DT GB - South Park Cows Updated 11/19/01 Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties in Butler's absence.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/19/01 Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day.   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down t! he! stretch.Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matc! hu! p for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated 10/23/01Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.Jerome P! at! hon, WR IND - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee s! ur! gery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. Warrick Dunn, RB TB - Team T-Bone Updated 10/23/01According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. Duce Staley, RB PHI - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on ! 11! carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. Joe Nedney, K TEN - CYSWC Updated 10/23/01Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.Eddie George, RB TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. Steve McNair, QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 10/23/01McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. Fred Taylor, RB JAC - High! S! hrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.   Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. Todd Heap, TE BAL - Money Shots Updated 10/23/01Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. Terry Allen, RB BAL - The Replacements Updated 10/23/01Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. Elvis Grbac, QB BAL! -! South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.   Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. Trung Canidate, RB STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.   J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/23/01Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing f! or! me because I was able to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/01Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/01According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Replacements Updated 10/21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games this year and has become a m! aj! or scoring threat even though he is not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - CYSWC Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Barking Spiders Updated 10/21/01 Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - The Replacements Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Water Boys Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Barking Spiders Updated 10/21/! 01!  Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - CYSWC Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) start! ed! Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - CYSWC Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Barking Spiders Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Team T-Bone Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Water Boys Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a T! D ! at Detroit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.!   Eddie George , RB TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the ! Fa! lcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Team T-Bone Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht  , TE NYJ - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Money Shots Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Water Boys Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"hello from Michele","Hi Denise, Kay, and Dutch, 
i thought i'd say hi before i logged off - 12:42 am.  Amanda has been home sick the past two days and i have been rescheduling appts and putting away christmas decorations. she is doing better and will head to school tomorrow.   
Denise i hope you are taking care of yourself. 
Kay and Dutch - thanks for sending your address, the kids are in the process of writing holiday thank you's.  Any chance you could send or email a picture of the puppy Rex, they would love it and me too. 
Kevin and Jo came for dinner last friday and kevin loaded some cool picture scanning software - hopefully i'll get some photos out this year on the web. 
Life is going good here - i am going to the  annual mardi gras committee meetings and setting boundaries and have NOT volunteered to head a committee. I just answer questions and give details and just talk to people about details.  I am loving IT!! and not overwhelmed. My big decision will be what dress to wear.  Larry is right back into working HARD on these sprint deals after our ski trip.  The kids are asking to go again - even Kyle after altitude sickness- they both want to be in breckenridge!! Larry talked to a friend that has a condo in i think winter park. said we could use it sometime.  any other news:  Kyle was star student last week - made a huge poster with tons of pictures to share with his class.  Amazing to me that he is almost 7 years old.  The art teacher told me that after class last monday he just spontaneously gave her the biggest hug  and it made her day.  He is one special little boy.   
Hugs and love to each of you, 
Michele 
PS Hey mom thought you'd enjoy reading this too.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates Scouting Reports  [IMAGE]  Latest NFL Player News   Giants , DT NYG  Updated 10/17/01 Defensive tackle Keith Hamilton suffered a separated shoulder during Sunday's game against St. Louis, but he is expected to play on Monday night against Philadelphia. Linebacker Mike Barrow has a hip pointer, but should be able to play in the game as well with some extra padding. CB Will Allen has a sprained ankle, and his status against the Eagles is questionable at this point.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL  Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dal! la! s Morning News , Leaf will get his chance to win the starting QB job in the next few weeks. ""If we're going to get an evaluation on him, this is the open window,"" coach Dave Campo said. ""At this point, I don't know if he's going to be any more than the third quarterback, but this is the window of opportunity."" In any event, Leaf's value as a Fantasy player will be very minimal.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined.   Reggie Swinton , WR DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Swinton (hamstring) will not practice this week in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined.   Robert Thomas , RB DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Thomas had an MRI performed on his sprained left ankle Monday, and is expected to miss at least one game. Thomas has no real Fantasy value at this point.   Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA  Updated 10/16/01 Hasselbeck is scheduled to start the Seahawks' next game October 28 against Miami due to a ! gr! oin injury suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. ""Matt has had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever he has to prove,"" Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter right now, especially against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA  Updated 10/16/01 Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he is not expected to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ""There's more to it than just a normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that,"" Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. ""He's injured, and he won't practice this week."" Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.  Tony Richardson  , RB KC  Updated 10/16/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 10/16/01 Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were expected back Tuesday.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA  Updated 10/16/01 Smith was in a ! wa! lking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against the Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.  Brian Griese , QB DEN  Updated 10/16/01 The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego, according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF  Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.  Jamal Anderson , RB ATL  Updated 10/16/01 Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL  Updated 10/16/01 Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday'! s ! game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. ""He really could possibly play this week,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""We're not going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out."" If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation throughout the week.   Justin McCareins , WR TEN  Updated 10/16/01 McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards.   Eddie Berlin , WR TEN  Updated 10/16/01 Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams,  will be sidelined three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a kickoff return Sunday.!   Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE  Updated 10/16/01 Browns' head coach Butch Davis told The Akron Plain-Dealer that Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout this week.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN  Updated 10/16/01 Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.  Marco Battaglia , TE CIN  Updated 10/16/01  Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is suffering from a strained left shoulder.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL  Updated 10/16/01 Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared himself fit enough to play. ""I'm still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up! e! very few hours to see if I was alive,"" he said, ""but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready.""      Redskins , DT WAS  Updated 10/16/01 Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the injury and is currently listed as day-to-day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS  Updated 10/16/01 Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as day-to-day.   Duce Staley , RB PHI  Updated 10/16/01 According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG  Updated 10/16/01 Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB  Updated 10/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we expect him to go.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL  Updated 10/16/01 Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game.    Reggie Swinton , WR DAL  Updated 10/16/01 Swinton suff! er! ed a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as day-to-day.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL  Updated 10/16/01 Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL  Updated 10/16/01 Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday. He is expected to miss six weeks of action due to the procedure.    Raghib Ismail , WR DAL  Updated 10/16/01 Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact Fantasy-wise.    More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"1000 Free PowerBall Chances for Saturday, January 26, 2002","

PLEASE READ FULL MESSAGE TO LEARN HOW TO GET 1,000 FREE CHANCES AT THE

Nobody won PowerBall on Wednesday BUT twelve lucky FreeLotto Players did win $21,000,000.00 in Jackpots! That's really no surprise when you consider that the odds of winning Classic FreeLotto's  $1,000,000.00 Grand Prize are far better than winning PowerBall. In fact, all but their SuperBucks game have better odds than PowerBall.

i got a call from jody's alleged partner last night...he's out and feels
guilty so since he is a manager at sherlock's....free 1st round when we
decide to visit....cheap bastard!

so am i jody's partner and do we have a 14th team????

i'm not sure who's more pathetic....me giving up a hawaiian vacation
2 years ago so i could partake....or grant taking time from work and
flying in from alaska to be part of the houston ffl?

gamblers rule!  now if we could only entice jody to bring aboard his
wife....all would be right.

That idea is the best I've heard so far.  And this thing about not voting
this year is crap because if enough people have issues about something it
should be voted on for this year.  It's not like it would be a major problem
to implement such a system for this year as you've already said we'll come
with two systems on Saturday.  This is what email is for - why can't we have
a vote on email between today and tomorrow and have a decision before
Saturday.

"Re: Transactions","will teams be aware of all players dropped????
if you guys (commissioners) are privy to all transactions but we
are not (ie. kiske's infamous mcnair pickup last year) then that
gives y'all an unfair advantage.  i want to know on/by Friday who all
has been released.  does the site offer that?

ty.servello@cs.oag.state.tx.us

>>> ""Kevin"" <klyn@pdq.net> 09/12/01 01:33PM >>>
Please do all transaction requests via the web site.  If you want more then one player, then let me know via email and I will add the second player to your list if the first one is not available.  All owners have until Friday, at 9am to enter transaction requests.  The requests will be given to owners with the worst record first then the worst point total second.  After Friday at 9am, you can still enter a request on a first come first served basis.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

HELLO!  THIS  IS  AMERICA! 
 
Broken Arrow, Oklahoma School officials remove ""God Bless America"" signs from
schools in fear that someone might be offended. 
  
Channel 12 News in Long Island, New York, orders flags removed from the
newsroom and red, white, and blue ribbons removed from the lapels of reporters.
 
 
Why? 
 
Management did not want to appear biased and felt that our nations flag might
give the appearance that ""they lean one way or another"". 
  
Berkeley, California bans U.S. Flags from being displayed on city fire trucks
because they didn't want to offend anyone in the community. 
  
In an ""act of tolerance"" the head of the public library at Florida Gulf Coast
University ordered all ""Proud to be an American"" signs removed so as to not
offend international students. 
  
I, for one, am quite disturbed by these actions of so-called American citizens;
and I am tired of this nation worrying about whether or not we are offending
some individual or their culture. 
 
Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge in
patriotism by the majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had
barely settled in New York and Washington D.C. when the ""politically correct""
crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending
others. 
  
I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is
seeking a better life by coming to America.  
 
In fact, our country's population is almost entirely comprised of descendants
of immigrants; however, there are a few things that those who have recently
come to our country, and apparently some native Americans, need to understand. 
  
First of all, it is not our responsibility to continually try not to offend you
in any way.  This idea of America being a multi-cultural community has served
ony to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity.  
 
As Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language, and
our own lifestyle. 
 
This culture, called the ""American Way"" has been developed over centuries of
struggles, trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have sought
freedom. 
 
Our forefathers fought, bled, and died at places such as Bunker Hill, Antietam,
San Juan, Iwo Jima, Normandy, Korea, Vietnam, 
  
We speak English, not Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other
language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society - learn our
language! 
 
""In God We Trust"" is our national motto. 
 
This is not some off-the-wall, Christian, Right Wing, political slogan;  it is
our national motto. 
 
It is engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it
is printed on our currency. 
 
We adopted this motto because Christian men and women, on Christian principles,
founded this nation; and this is clearly documented throughout our history. 
 
If it is appropriate for our motto to be inscribed in the halls of our highest
level of Government, then it is certainly appropriate to display it on the
walls of our schools. 
  
God is in our pledge, our National Anthem, nearly every patriotic song, and in
our founding documents.  We honor His birth, death, and resurrection as
holidays, and we turn to Him in prayer in times of crisis. 
 
If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as
your new home, because God is part of our culture and we are proud to have Him.
  
We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our
freedoms. We celebrate Independence Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and Flag
Day.  
 
We have parades, picnics, and barbecues where we proudly wave our flag. 
 
As an American, I have the right to wave my flag, sing my national anthem,
quote my national motto, and cite my pledge whenever and wherever I choose. 
 
If the Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like Uncle Sam, then you
should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet. 
  
The American culture is our way of life, our heritage, and we are proud of it. 
We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we really don't
care how you did things where you came from, if it was so superior, go home. 
 
We are Americans, like it or not, this is our country, our land, and our
lifestyle. 
  
Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion about
our government, culture, or society, and we will allow you every opportunity to
do so. 
 
But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about our flag, our
pledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly encourage you take
advantage of one other great American freedom, the right to leave. 
 
 
If you agree, pass this on to other Americans!! 
It is time to take a stand!! 
 
MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA LAND THAT WE LOVE!!!

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game.    Derrick Alexander  , WR KC - She Said Updated 10/25/01   Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets.    James Hodgins  , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy.     Dave Stachelski  , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards.     Michael Bennett  , RB MIN - The Hillrods Updated 10/25/01   Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week.     Todd Heap  , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week.     Anthony Thomas  , RB CHI - The Hillrods Updated 10/25/01   Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report.     Kevin Swayne  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy.     Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle. He is still recovering from a foot injury.     Terry Allen  , RB BAL - She Said Updated 10/25/01   Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive.     Jason Brookins  , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday. He might actually start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen. Nevertheless, he is listed as probable on the injury report.     Shannon Sharpe  , TE BAL - KMB Express Updated 10/25/01   Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury report.

Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Galloway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's practice. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the Cowboys' previous game.     Charlie Batch  , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detroit Free Press reports that he is still expected to play Sunday against the Bengals.     O.J. McDuffie  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury.     Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out because of broken ribs.     Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Xtreme Updated 10/25/01   Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting lineup.     Terry Glenn  , WR NE - The Hillrods Updated 10/25/01   Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday.     Drew Bledsoe  , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills.     Chad Morton  , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain.     Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit.     Chad Johnson  , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence.     Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 10/25/01   Wheatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Contra Costa Times that he is making progress. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Eagles.

Jacquez Green  , WR TB - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/25/01   Green is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Minnesota. He is recovering from a groin strain. Frank Murphy will replace Green at receiver if he is unable to play.     Warrick Dunn  , RB TB - Third World Countryman Updated 10/25/01   Dunn participated in running drills Wednesday and did not have any setbacks in his recovery from a toe injury, according to The St. Petersburg Times .

EES Keeps the Fire Burning

EES Q4 Deals: EES is pounding the pavement, making calls and (of course) making deals. The Third Party Sales Group continues to dominate the small business market in Texas, New York and Massachusetts, currently signing over 2000 new deals each week. Texas, which is known for doing everything in a big way, accounts for about 60 percent of the new deals signed. With success in the three markets already achieved, the Third Party Sales Group has moved into new territory, the Illinois market. The Third Party Sales Group, which was established less than five months ago, has already signed up more than 24,000 customers.

The Mid Market group is also bringing new customers into the fold. In these first few weeks of Q4, the Mid Market group has added Boston Market and Holiday Inn in New York, Moody Gardens and American National Insurance Company in Galveston, the Jewish Community Center Houston, Gulf Coast Retailers Association, El Fenix Restaurants in Dallas and Maxim. 
 
The commercial, manufacturing/industrial and regional commodity groups are continuing to offer EES' products and services to large business consumers and have successfully brought in several large deals over the past few weeks. New customers include Sonoco, Wendy's, Unilever and Sara Lee with gas contracts and Ball Corp, Oil Tanking and Sysco with power contracts in Texas. 

Customer Information and Support: Prior to and following Enron's merger with Dynegy, customers have expressed many questions about EES and where we stand on our contracts.

The Dynegy/Enron Merger
Dynegy and Enron Merger: On November 9, Dynegy and Enron announced an agreement for a merger between the two companies which is expected to confirm the value of Enron's core business, rebuild customer, counter party and investor confidence and strengthen Enron's liquidity. Of the potential options considered outside of a merger, few could provide ""the earnings potential and immediate synergies"" that a combination with Dynegy could provide according to Greg Whalley, Enron president and chief operating officer. 

The new organization will focus on core businesses including wholesale energy markets and commercial and industrial energy users. Enron will continue to act as an independent company until the merger, which is expected to close at the end of Q3 2002, is complete. Click here  to view the press release outlining the merger details and the merger Q&A.

Enron Investor Update Conference Call: Enron held an investor conference call early Thursday morning to provide investors with an up to date overview of the company's current situation. During the call, Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron, reviewed occurrences which led to the current loss in investor confidence and decline in liquidity such as bad investments, ""perceived"" conflicts of interest in related-party transactions, lack of transparency and errors in financial statements. ""We fully understand and regret the combination of events that have resulted in loss of investor confidence,"" said Lay, and we ""are fully committed to fixing the problems."" 

In an effort to restore operational and financial momentum, Enron will be split into Core and Non-Core businesses and Businesses Under Review. 
?	The core businesses which were performing at all time highs prior to the events that lead to the merger with    	Dynegy provide ""significant earnings and cash flow opportunities with unique competitive advantages,"" 		according to Greg Whalley, president and chief operating officer. Core businesses include the natural gas 		pipeline business, and the gas and power, retail and coal busniesses in North America and Europe.
?	Non-core businesses such as broadband and Azurix will be divested and the earnings will be used to repay 		debt and reinvest in core businesses. 
?	Businesses Under Review are potential future markets outside of power and gas wholesale businesses. 
 
The conference call is separated into five sections: Introduction, Business Overview, Business Segment Update, Financial Review and Outlook and Q&A session for easy access to needed information. Click here  to listen to the conference call.

Dynegy and Enron Investor Conference Call: In Monday morning's conference call, Dynegy and Enron executives reviewed the merger details and fielded questions from investors. Chuck Watson, Dynegy chairman and chief executive officer, reiterated the strength of Enron's core business units and the high level of integrity of the people working in the trenches. Watson and Ken Lay also spoke of the advantages that Enron's business units would bring to the new organization with Watson making specific note of EES. ""EES is three to five years ahead of Dynegy's retail unit"" and is an ""earnings contributor and growth engine that will continue in the combined company"" according to Watson. The conference call replay will be available until 5:00 p.m. EST, Monday, November 26. Click here  to listen to the conference call.

Conference Call Slide Show: If you don't have time to listen to the conference, the slideshow presentation is also available. Click here  to view the presentation.

Enron Elects New Treasurer: Raymond M. Bowen, Jr., the former chief operating officer of Enron Industrial Markets, has been elected as the new executive vice president - finance and treasurer. ""Ray has extremely good credibility with the investment community,"" according to Ken Lay and is ""well respected and trusted by banks and other financial institutions.""

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down! t! he stretch.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Pumpdog Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbec! k ! from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Baby Blues Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Xtreme Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Cali Bound Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Xtreme Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Cali Bound Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will a! ct! ivate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third World Countryman Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - KMB Express Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gaine! d ! 34 yards on 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Baby Blues Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - She Said Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - The Wounded Ducks Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor! , RB JAC - She Said Updated 10/23/01Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.    Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - She Said Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The ! Le! ather Cheerios Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Xtreme Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - KMB Express Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because! I! was able to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - KMB Express Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Baby Blues Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Money Shots Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""   Emmitt Smith! , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.""   But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.    Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Money Shots Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score! o! n an eight-yard run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , WR NE - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Money Shots Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - The Replacements Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless P! ri! ce  , WR BUF - The Replacements Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - Money Shots Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight  , WR MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Money Shots Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Team T-Bone Updated 10/28/01 ! To! omer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Water Boys Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Dono! va! n McNabb  , QB PHI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the ! ye! ar.  David Boston , WR ARI - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Team T-Bone Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger , TE IND - Money Shots Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - Barking Spiders Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expecte! d ! to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB IND - Money Shots Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss  , WR MIN - The Replacements Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - The Replacements Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn, WR NE - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/18/01Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week. Antowain Smith , RB NE - CYSWC Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He c! ou! ld have a good week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Team T-Bone Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WA! S ! - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at ! ti! ght end now that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Water Boys Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce  , WR STL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/18/01 Canidate will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Team T-Bone Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Water Boys Updated 10/18/01 Buck! ha! lter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - The Replacements Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point.    Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - CYSWC Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Scouting Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI  Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BAL  Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games for violating the NFL's drug and alcohol policy. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allow! ed! to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN  Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL  Updated 11/16/01 Smith will ret! ur! n to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI  Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO  Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO  Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense. !   Willie Jackson , WR NO  Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS  Updated 11/16! /0!  Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01  Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01! Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL  Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL  Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR  Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR  Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had on! ly! two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR  Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR  Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB  Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB  Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven tou! ch! downs in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB  Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""   Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.""   But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.    Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Pumpdog Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Pumpdog Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard! r! un, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - The Hillrods Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - The Wounded Ducks Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - She Said Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - The Leather Cheerios Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless ! Pr! ice  , WR BUF - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Pumpdog Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Leather Cheerios Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - She Said Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Baby B! lu! es Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Cali Bound Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - The Leather Cheerios Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes fo! r ! 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - KMB Express Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Baby Blues Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Do! no! van McNabb  , QB PHI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Cali Bound Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year. David Boston , WR ARI - The Hillrods Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - She Said Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Cali Bound Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

Player Updates Scouting Reports   [IMAGE]'); [IMAGE]   Latest NFL Player News    Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN  Updated 10/25/01   Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit.     Chad Johnson  , WR CIN  Updated 10/25/01   Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence.     Chris Sanders  , WR TEN  Updated 10/25/01   Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK  Updated 10/25/01   Wheatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Contra Costa Times that he is making progress. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Eagles.     Keyshawn Johnson  , WR TB  Updated 10/25/01   Johnson ran in the morning and afternoon but did not practice Wednesday, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Johnson is recovering from hip and thigh injuries but is expected to play Sunday.     Jacquez Green  , WR TB  Updated 10/25/01   Green is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Minnesota. He is recovering from a groin strain. Frank Murphy will replace Green at receiver if he is unable to play.     Warrick Dunn  , RB TB  Updated 10/25/01   Dunn participated in running drills Wednesday and did not have any setbacks in his recovery from a toe injury, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Nevertheless, Dunn is still listed as questionable for this week's game against Minnesota.     Ike Hilliard  , WR NYG  Updated 10/25/01   Hillard is suffering from soreness in his surgically-repaired foot, according to the New York Newsday . The foot was sore following the Giants game against St. Louis in Week Five but it is even more sore now. Keep an eye on this situation. This condition might force Hilliard to the sidelines if it intensifies.     Damon Jones  , TE JAC  Updated 10/25/01   Jones' status for this week's game is questionable, according to The Florida Times-Union . He missed practice on Wednesday because of a shoulder injury. Kyle Brady will get most of the looks at tight end if Jones is unable to play.     Elvis Joseph  , RB JAC  Updated 10/25/01   Joseph took a lot of snaps in practice Wednesday and will be incorporated in as the third-down back, according to The Florida Times-Union . Joseph won't have much value in this job but he will take carries away from starter Stacey Mack.     Tyrone Davis  , TE GB  Updated 10/25/01   Davis could return from his hamstring injury sooner than what was originally expected, according to published reports. He might begin practicing next week and will almost certainly be activated before his target date of Thanksgiving. Davis has been sidelined since August because of hamstring surgery. Nevertheless, he will be the No. 2 tight end when he returns.     Elvis Grbac  , QB BAL  Updated 10/25/01   Grbac will likely be a game-time decision for Sunday's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . He threw very little in practice and is still suffering from a sore chest. Randall Cunningham will start if Grbac is unable to play.      Randy Moss  , WR MIN  Updated 10/25/01   Moss is suffering from tendonitis in his left Achilles tendon, according to The Pioneer Press . Moss missed practice Wednesday but is expected to play on Sunday.     Tony Martin  , WR ATL  Updated 10/25/01   Martin might be ready to play when the Falcons resume their season on November 4. He has been sidelined for the past four games because of a broken collarbone but the Atlanta Journal-constitution reports that he ran routes on Wednesday and caught some passes.     Wane McGarity  , WR DAL  Updated 10/25/01   The Saints have signed McGarity, who was released by the Cowboys earlier this season. McGarity will be used mostly on returns, but he might eventually work his way into the Saints' regular rotation of receivers.     Matt Stover  , K BAL  Updated 10/25/01   Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs.     Eric Metcalf  , WR OAK  Updated 10/25/01   The Washington Redskins signed Metcalf on Wednesday. He will be used mostly as a returner and has minimal Fantasy value.      Tim Biakabutuka  , RB CAR  Updated 10/25/01   Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his right foot. ""He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,"" coach George Seifert said Wednesday. ""Basically, it just separated,"" Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. ""The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together."" Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again.        James Stewart  , RB DET  Updated 10/25/01   Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ  Updated 10/25/01   Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.  Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup.       Terrell Davis  , RB DEN  Updated 10/25/01   Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be limited if he does play Sunday.        Clint Stoerner  , QB DAL  Updated 10/25/01   Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season.       Anthony Wright  , QB DAL  Updated 10/25/01   Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday.   Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet.        Terrell Davis  , RB DEN  Updated 10/24/01   Davis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited.    Amani Toomer  , WR NYG  Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ  Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN  Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert Emanuel  , WR NE  Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.    Hines Ward  , WR PIT  Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET  Updated 10/24/01   The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

Like I said, I knew Ricky would get all of them. Now was that all of them
on
the first try? If so, John your reputation is now on the line.

Brought to you by   Sponsorship Bar You are receiving these e-reports because you have signed up for CBS SportsLine.com Fantasy Football.  To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - She Said Updated 11/21/01 Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain in his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Baby Blues Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hillrods Update! d ! 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Baby Blues Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/20/01Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She Said Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Cali Bound Updated 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Xtreme Updated 11! /2! 0/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player, but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley.    Giants , DT NYG - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be! a! ble to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/20/01 The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Xtreme Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was ! ex! pected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job,"" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.   ! Chris Weinke , QB CAR - KMB Express Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Pumpdog Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to! p! ost solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Third World Countryman Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Third World Countryman Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - 2700 ! HU! EVOS Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Countryman Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Baby Blues Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. !   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Xtreme Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Pumpdog Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Baby Blues Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Xtreme Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Baby Blues ! Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Walls has! b! een held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - KMB Express Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Hillrods Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Baby Blues Updated 11/16/01 S! ch! roeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.

"Re: Transactions","hey commissioners....
i put in a transaction last week to kevin & via the website.
w/ kevin i requested goings/jamel white/cecil martin (1st available)
for dominic rhodes.
at website could only request goings for rhodes (which kiske snagged 1st).

someone needs to give us jamel white.  i tried to pick him up yesterday
and the site wouldn't let me.  if we still want to make any other waivers
this week is it possible?

ty.servello@cs.oag.state.tx.us

>>> ""Kevin"" <klyn@pdq.net> 09/12/01 01:33PM >>>
Please do all transaction requests via the web site.  If you want more then one player, then let me know via email and I will add the second player to your list if the first one is not available.  All owners have until Friday, at 9am to enter transaction requests.  The requests will be given to owners with the worst record first then the worst point total second.  After Friday at 9am, you can still enter a request on a first come first served basis.
