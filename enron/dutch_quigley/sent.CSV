Deal NS5777.2  , from 7/27/2000 of last year,  should have been killed along time ago. Can you kill the deal in the system please.
This might come up as a prior period adjustment, I do not know what happens when they are this old.

"","Two statues in a city park, one female and one male, had faced each
other for many years. One morning, an angel appeared and told the
statues, ""Since you have both brought enjoyment to many people for
years, I'm giving you your greatest wish and bringing you to life for 30
minutes. In that time you may do whatever you like."" And the statues
came to life.

Smiling at each other, they ran toward a stand of trees and dove behind
a couple of bushes. The angel smiled as she listened to them giggling
and rustling in the grass. After 15 minutes, the statues emerged from
the bushes, smiling and happy. The angel was puzzled. ""You still have 15
minutes. Would you like to continue?""

The male statue looked at the female and asked, ""Do you want to do it
again?""
""Oh, yes!"" the female statue said. ""But this time YOU hold the pigeon
down and I'LL poop on its head!""

The claim number is 8202536549 filed 8/31 on our homeowner's policy#216939226
I don't think they assigned an adjustor yet - they said someone from that claims

Hi Dutch,

Per our conversation today, I am resending the questions and concerns that
I have on the Futures and Options practice questions/graphic ideas.  It is
very important that we setup some time with you next week or the week after
Thanksgiving.  Let me know what your schedule looks like.

I need final signoffs on the Futures and Options practice
exercises/graphics.  The deadline for this was today.  I need to know if
you are okay with the graphic ideas and practice questions that you've seen
so far for the Futures and Options.

Questions and Concerns: I know you have seen these questions several times,
so I pointed out the areas that I need your help.
(1.) I need help with question #4 in Options.  I need help developing the
graphic for this question.
(2.) I need the answers to the scenario questions that you created and the
explanation for the answers.

Attached below are the two topics that you are responsible for in the
Knowledge System.
(See attached file: Futures Graphic ideas and practices_2.doc)(See attached
file: Options Graphic ideas and practices_3.doc)

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in the Allen Center garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Good question. I am not sure what the copyright regulations are in regards
to that website. I know we have full access to Enron's BRM course content -
you can copy/paste straight from there.

I will ask Kirk McDaniels about the Nymex website first thing tomorrow
morning and get back to you.

Have a good night.

Here are my comments on Options (See attachment below).

We need examples of:
Cap (Call Option)
Floor
Collar

In addition we need information on Financial option.


Accenture, in all the documents can we have roll over capabilities on the bold words and instead of Click here because time is of essence in our culture and having the learner have to go to the glossary or click for a pop up creates opportunities for disengagement.

I know I have spoke to several of you about this event, and for everyone else, I thought you might be interested so I decided to send an email with the details.  This benefit raises funds to extend research and patient services to over 1350 families that are affected by a neuromuscular disorder in the Houston Gulf Coast area.

The date is Saturday, October 6, 2001 at the Houston Club downtown (6:30 pm - 12 am; dinner is served at 8 pm).  Local celebrities, such as TV anchors, radio DJs, former oilers, local business owners, etc. wait tables to raise money.  There is a silent and live auction, as well as dinner, dancing and a casino.  The cost is $75 per person and a table seats 10.  Black tie optional.  Beer and wine will be included in the ticket price until 10 pm.   Silent and live auction items include autographed sports paraphernalia (Joe Torre baseball signed at the 61* HBO premiere), Continental tickets, golf packages, autographed CD package, autographed book collection, theater tickets, spa packages, etc.  This my fourth year to help out with this event and it is really a fun, lively benefit. 

If you are interested, please let me know.  Also, please let me know if you want to put together a table of 10 and the people who will be sitting at that table.  There are approximately 300 people that attend the event.
Rebecca

Subject: RE: Franchise Players and the  Draft
As  the creator of the algebraic mean sequenced draft order that was built to  eliminate the inherent advantage that the #1 & #14 teams had by getting  back to back picks every other round, I think the time for mathematical  preciseness has passed.  I'm all for going to a simplified traditional  snake system.  Frankly, at this point I think there are as many  disadvantages to being 1 or 14 (or 2 - 13) as advantages that it all works  itself out.  Hell, if it makes preparing for the draft any easier (or  administering the league), I'm for it!
 
PS -  I'm for keeping TE's too!

Subject: Franchise Players and the  Draft
The following is the list of franchise players  that have been kept:
 
Grant Johnson - Eddie George
Jeff Smith - Peyton Manning
Michael Deluke - Marshall Faulk
Michael Currie - Edgerrian James
Jeff Ullrich - Kurt Warner
 
I know this was brought up last year and we  kind of decided much of nothing...but does anyone object to going to a snake  system for the draft.  1-14, 14-1 for the whole draft?  We will  still have a supplemental round for those that do not keep franchise  players.  Then the non-franchise teams will pick in opposite order of  the supplemental round for round one...thus if you pick first in the  supplemental round, you will pick last (for those that did not keep  franchise players) in the first round.  Then, the teams that kept  franchise players will be randomly selected to pick at the end of the first  round.  After the first round, the draft will snake back the other way  with the last pick in the first round getting the first pick in the second  round and the draft will continue in this snake order until the end of the  draft.  Let me know what you think or if you are confused.
 
See everyone at the draft!!! 
 
Kevin

FINAL
E.10
(Copyright 2001)

THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.
Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create ""shortages"" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for ""maintenance""? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them.

Subject:	RE: Franchise Players and the Draft

The snake thing is good and bad.   But I think the first round should be
randomly selected for ALL teams because the current way gives those not
keeping a franchise player a double benefit by picking in the supplemental
and then also at the top of the first round.   Theoretically the non keeper
teams are getting the 8-14 best players who are arguably also franchise
players.  In effect by not keeping a player you are randomly selecting a
lower level franchise player.  So they shouldn't get the an automatic shot
at 15-22 or whatever it might be as well.  So snake or no snake all of round
one should be random order.

One of the questions posed in Don?t Sweat the Small Stuff is, ?Will this
matter a year fromnow?? Some things will, of course. But so many
others--perhaps most things---won?t. There is something very comforting in
knowing this. When the computer crashes, the keys are misplaced, the house
is a mess or the call isn?t returned, it is annoying, but it?s not the end
the world.

Dutch,

Pursuant to our conversation.

This is the risk we would like to swap out.
This is from your view......meaning if the position is positive ENRON is
LONG to JARON.  JARON would need to buy from ENRON to flatten out.

Cal 3      (572)
Cal 4      1921
Cal 5       655
Cal 6    (1002)
Cal 7      (454)
Cal 8         96

I would prefer to Buy from Enron if you cannot find spreads.

Thanks,

Subject: Back office issues



Fred- 

There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately.  We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.

2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.  

""I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out"" 
""It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade"" 
""We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for"" 
""We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type"" 
""I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here"" 


From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said ""they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. 

The latest is the most disturbing:

""we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude"" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed

We do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the ""backoffice""?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).

We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  

All the problems are being caused by the following:

1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.

There are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.

Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.

2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  

We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.

2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.

2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. 

3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  

4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.

Dutch's suggestion would alleviate all of Kevin's points below.  Whether we
snake after that is another issue - the top three rounds are more important

"RE: Gas Curves","Eric,

John is comfortable with sending out a 5 year curve to Egypt
also he does not want to adjust the length of the forward price curve in the system due to non liquidity in the market that far forward

Dutch,

Per our conversation last week, can the gas price curve be extended out past 2024?  Also,  could you ask John about sending Egypt a historical forward curve.  They would like to see a couple of historical curves from the last 6 months out as far as we are willing to go.

I'll check back with you this afternoon. 

Thanks again.

Kay,

Thanks for your call the other night.  I was at the hospital.  Jackie is
doing ok so far but today she has a big operation to put a tube in her chest
- a permanent replacement for the IV in her hand that the doctors say kids
like better since they don't see it under their shirts and get used to it
after a week or two.  75% chance to live at this point and if all goes as
planned there will be no need for a bone marrow transplant but she will need
blood transfusions...we don't need to donate at all as HK as a supply of
blood already...no visitors to her room except me, vicky, michelle, and
michelle's boyfriend...mom may have told you by now she has ALL Type B and I
got the info on Type B that you downloaded from the web - thanks - i am
still reading through all of the materials from the doctor - i do have alot
of questions - if you have a friend at MD Anderson i need to find out what
the ""German Method"" of treatment for leukemia is and whether it's  just as
good as the american method, and i also want to find out whether chinese
people can have the same treatment as westerners...i would think that at md
anderson they would have experience treating both chinese and western
patients so they should know if the treatments are normally the same or
not...i don't know if this hospital has ever had a western leukemia patient
before...thanks again.
Robert

Dutch,

I was wondering if you could have the price curve that is loaded into the system extended out through 2030.  It ends in 2024 right now, but some of the LNG deals that we are looking at are longer than that.  We use it for VERY indicative purposes only and would talk with you and John if any serious numbers were needed.

If this is a problem or if I need to contact someone else, please let me know.

thanks,

Which option works best for you: LAX was too expensive

1- Leave 8/31 at 5:30pm arrive Orange County 6:55pm
Returns 9/3 leaves there 2pm arrives here 7:20pm 
Total price $331.50 per person

OR
2- Leave 8/31 at 8:40pm arrive Orange County 9:55pm
Returns 9/3 leaves there 2pm arrives here 7:20pm
Total Price $243.50 per person

PS
No need to use up miles for this since tickets are not very pricey- would rather
save those 80k miles to go to a more expensive destination

Dutch,

Attached is a file with volumes for the EEX VPP.  Remember, we will simply do an incremental VPP with additional volumes (column C), but our ""pitch"" to EEX is to tell them how much they would save by doing the incremental with us and not another company.  So, we want you to quote up the unwind of the existing VPP (offer in column B) as well as the Bid for the entire volume (column A).

Please provide the quote based upon where you set tonight's curve.

Per my model ...

A: Total Volume - Adjustment is -.1259
B: Existing Volume - Adjustment is -.0548
C: Incremental Volume - Adjustment is -.0475

Thanks!

Eric

Dearest K-Kay and Dutch,
Was really hoping to hear from you by this morning.  After what we saw on CNN  last night I want to know that you both are okay  - haven't traveled - and all of your friends are okay too!
We're only getting bits and pieces of news and it's  so shocking.
I want to hear from you now even if it's just one  line!
Love MOM

Subject:	Michaela's Birthday

Hopefully everyone got their invitation to her party and now you can all
throw them away.  If you were coming to the party it has been cancelled b/c
Michaela is very sick.  Carrie took off today to take her to the doctor with
my mom and I'm not sure how she will be feeling by this weekend.  So we
think the best thing to do is just cancel and she just wont get any cake.
We are a little worried about her so say a prayer and hopefully all will be
okay.

Richard

don't we still have nine holes left at texas national?  and if so (and they have not expired),  why not try and head out there next weekend or something?  if not just a regular round somewhere else.  i'd be apt to go somewhere else besides brock and stuff.  i heard there are some pretty decent courses that are not too expensive if you dive out 20 minutes or so.  ernie said there's a course out in the baytown area that's not too bad.  let me know what you think.  i hope that everything is working itself out for you.  i know it's cheezy but i'm here for you.

Attached is the quote sheet I mentioned earlier - we are submitting the indicative bid Tuesday, Aug. 28th, so I will be sure to check back with you Monday afternoon for a real-time number.  For now, a notional Offer-Mid spread would be helpful (to ensure our models do not explode when we include it...)  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.  Thanks!

Hi Dutch,

Per our conversation today, I am resending the questions and concerns that
I have on the Futures and Options practice questions/graphic ideas.  It is
very important that we setup some time with you next week or the week after
Thanksgiving.  Let me know what your schedule looks like.

I need final signoffs on the Futures and Options practice
exercises/graphics.  The deadline for this was today.  I need to know if
you are okay with the graphic ideas and practice questions that you've seen
so far for the Futures and Options.

Questions and Concerns: I know you have seen these questions several times,
so I pointed out the areas that I need your help.
(1.) I need help with question #4 in Options.  I need help developing the
graphic for this question.
(2.) I need the answers to the scenario questions that you created and the
explanation for the answers.

Attached below are the two topics that you are responsible for in the
Knowledge System.
(See attached file: Futures Graphic ideas and practices_2.doc)(See attached

Hello Dutch.

Hope you are having a good Monday. I've delayed this message in hopes that
you catch up with the last three weeks' assignments that you have not
handed in yet. As I noted in our discussion last week, it will be
signficantly helpful to Monica and I to receive any information you've
gathered to this point, as opposed to receiving it all at the end.

As usual, I've included the high-level outline for each content area that
you should follow when writing this week's assignment. Remember, this
assignment should be placed in the ECW. I've included instructions to
remind you how to use this tool.  Note - If the content you have written
does not fit onto the page, please just send it to us in an email. Thank
you!

2) Types of Options (Page 1_7_3_1 - in the Options topic)

Due Date: Friday, November 2nd, 2001

Outlines to Help Guide You When Writing

     Do not care who the counterparty is

     Hedging or Speculating
   Different Types of Users

     Commercials (e.g. Enron, Dynegy)
     End users
     ""Locals"" ? (Guys at the Exchange trying to buy low/sell high)
   Costs involved with a futures contract
     Margin as a guarantee of contract
   Closing out a futures position
     Make or take delivery
     Reverse futures position (i.e. liquidate position)
     Exchange of a futures position for a cash position at another location
     (e.g. EFP)

Types of Option
<<Dutch, this should be a short write up with explanations/definitions of
the major different types of options.>>
   Physical vs. Financial
   Asian, European and American
   Swaption
   Dutch, you may want to mention that many other types of options exist

Finally and most importantly, please keep in mind that the completion of
these assignments significantly impacts the the ability of our BRM project
to stay on schedule and within budget. If you are unable to complete this
assignment, please notify me ahead of time and provide an estimated time
for completion.

This is the same deal Russell has been pricing up with you.  It is a big VPP with Hilcorp and Lehman is recommending they proceed with Enron and we plan on meeting on Monday.

So, can I get a refresh BID on the following....

OK ladies and gentlemen.  It has been quite a while since we had a Houston area Sammy Happy Hour, but I thought that we should do one again.  If you received this e-mail in error, or don't want to receive this type of e-mail, then just reply and I will take you out of my address book.  It needs updating as I have duplicate e-mails for some of you guys and gals.  I am thinking the 17th, 18th, or 19th.  I will make a tally of which day is best, so please reply.  If you don't reply, then I will assume that any of those days is good for you and make an executive decision.  Also, once we nail down a date, please pass this info along to anyone who might wish to come.  I know some of you guys don't live in town, or even in TX for that matter, but I just wanted to let you know what was going on.  Actives from SFA who might be in town that week are invited as well.  I look forward to hearing from all of you.

Subject:	NFL Pick'em

This is an invitation for you to join the best NFL office pool since
well, last year's pool.  During the off-season, a secret vote was
apparently held to designate me as the commissioner for this year's
league.  Well let's do it...

General Q&A about this league to help you realize you should sign up
and play (for those of you who have not played before):

Q1.  How much does this cost me?
A1.  Ah yes, the most important question.  It costs $100 per player.
The money is due to me by Sunday, September 9.  You don't pay...you
don't play!  Get your fee to me in person or mail it to the following
address:

Brian Dunlavy
8073 El Mundo
Houston, TX 77054


Q2.  What is this?
A2.  It's an NFL office pool.  Each week, you will select the winners
of the NFL games straight up and assign a ranking of 15 to 1 for the
games (or 14, 13 if teams are off).  Your 15 game is your most
confident game while your 1 game is the game that you just can't
figure out.  If your team wins, then you get the number of points you
designated to that team.  For example, New York Giants vs. Cleveland
Browns.  You select New York to win and rank them with 15.  They win,
you get 15 points.  They lose, you don't get any points.

Q3.  Why are the rankings for the games important?
A3.  Because that is how you win money!  Each week, the individual
with the highest score wins the weekly money which will be $50.  A
running total of the scores is kept for the season and the rest of
the money will be paid to first through fifth place (possibly sixth
place).

Q4.  How do I enter and play?
A4.  The league name is ""H-Town Slaps"".  You can access the site at
any time using the web address:

http://football217.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/join?league=slaplist&

NOTE: Once you get to the Join League Page, you will be asked to
enter a password.  The password for this league is:

kingme10

On the Join League page, select your name from the drop-down list. If
you don't see your name, select ""New Player"" and click Submit.

Read over the rules for the league for further information.  If you
have any questions or concerns, please contact me.

Good Luck!  Also, I don't have everyone's email addresses (especially
those who have played in the past) so please forward this email to
your friends who may be interested in playing.

Thanks,
Brian

   September 8th it is!  franchise players to be named by 8/31!
   draft will be 11-12 ish but where?  dan has volunteered his house
   (pearland)...we can do it at mine (katy)...or anywhere else that might
   be more centrally located?
   jody has shown interest for years and even held the draft at his place
   a few years back (the infamous pool basketball tournament...and the
   black
   eyes which resulted from it....and let's not forget the HAWK/rotweiller
   -C
    URBY/warlock doberman showdown).  i say we give him the first
   opportunity.

   jody,
   once we figure who has designated a franchise player then the remaining
   teams without one have what we call a supplemental draft....basically a
   catch up round.  there is one catch for those who pick franchise
   players....
   when we draw numbers for the 1st ""official"" round they pick at the
   bottom
   because they have the best players in hand.

   sorry if i'm being the brother at arms but we need to finalize asap.
   the
   cost
   is $225????  someone please confirm.   jody, john szallai is back in
   town
   and wants in on the action and i will share a team with him if necessary
   or you can???  we also vote at every draft what upcoming changes we
   desire for the following year.

   Malone has officially kicked Stockton off the team...therefore, I will

   jumping to the weak ASS north (A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME) to join Malone
   (although our name will change) and leave my Southern team in the

   hands of my co-owner Jeff.  Dutch has said that he will be back.  Thus,

   Well it seems that Kevin has already done plenty of work on this.  I'm
   glad
   to see that plenty of people are still interested and planning on being
   there.  Dan's e-mail is bouncing back - so Ty try and get in touch with
   him,
   and Jody if need be.

   I'm assuming that the franchise player issue for next year will be voted
   on
   at the draft, as usual.  Kiske, a motion to eliminate Tight Ends?

   Current status quo - franchise players were voted on at last year's
   draft
   and will be allowed for this season, but we will be voting on whether or
   not
   to eliminate them for upcoming seasons.

   Everyone comfortable with announcing your franchise player by August 31?

   I'll designate my franchise player as Edgerrin James.
   I vote for September 8th as well,  11 or 12 is fine with me.

   Michael

   Subject:  Questions regarding storage

   Hi there Dutch!

   How are you? Hope you're doing well.

   We having been working on a storage problem that Philip as given us the
   framework for.  In working out the details, we've come across a few
   questions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's
   description of this problem in the word doc below, just for reference.

   1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months.  We
   understand that since the users are making storage decisions and hedging
   future months, they need to take time value of money into account.  What
   is
   actually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the instruments?
   How does that factor into user's storage decisions?

   2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and
   then
   select instruments to hedge positions created by the storage.  In our
   other
   scenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the Enron
   risk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the
   appropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the instruments
   cover.  In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by
   storage
   decisions.  What risk bucket would storage create a position in? My
   thoughts are that if the only positions created are by storage, then
   would
   the user really need only 1 type of instrument to hedge their risks?

   Thanks in advance for your help, Dutch!

   Ann

well e-mailing to be exact and we were planning to hopefully play some golf this weekend.  we were thinking of maybe hitting something along the lines of maybe tricky dick's part of town (baytown).  if anyone has interest or other options e-mail back, also if you can what day.  we thought about baytown because it's probably as expensive as brock but a different locale.  
 
i love losing other people's money for a living!!!!

Dutch,

I've attached a spreadsheet which lists volumes for a prepay with the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia (originator is Gil Muhl).  The volumes are not ratable over time, so I thought it might be easier for you to cut and paste the schedule into your model.  The term is November 1, 2001 - October 31, 2006.  The average daily volume is around 78,000 mmBtu/day.

I'm looking for your notional offer - This won't close until Q4.  Please call me if you have any questions - thanks for your help!

One of my new projects is to find a good software that my group can use that does risk management, real time updates, some forecasting, etc... Basically, do you guys use any kinds of software (besides the in-house stuff) that I can research ?

I know its bid week, so just get back to when when you get a chance! Thanks!! I hope that you are making some money there... STock price sucks right now!

We are doing much better with interviews (See below). Thanks & keep up the good work. Please complete assignments on time. In addition, we need each SME as a minimum to allot 4 hours a week towards this project, which will significantly increase the potential for the end product to ""Exceed the Mark & Expectations.""

Quote for this week: ""One should always bloom, where one is planted.""

Have a great weekend and I hope to see all of you on the Oct 24th Boat Ride.

Thanks for your great efforts thus far.

I have this little project to do and i need a little help from you... (since you are an expert in this field!!)

ok-- i need to figure out what the premium is on an aug on- peak call option for power. Now , I know that power is not what you do, but I can use some ideas on how to get started.

Terms

Strike price  is $200/ MWH
Forward curve for Aug is $125/MWH
Aug 2001
Foward Volatility of 100%
Valuation Date is June 8, 2001
Interest Rate is 6%
On- Peak Call Option for 50 MW

SO far, I have looked at some forcasts for Aug, and seen which hours the market rate is above 200 to come up with a premium value.  I have an answer for this problem, but I was just curous as to see where you would start. Anything will work. Thanks!!

Purvi

P.S-- also, don't be hesitant to tell me that you have no clue--- You'll still be my favorite manager!!!

Hola,

If all recipients would please be soooo kind as to respond back with a home
mailing address....except for suebob and jojo..got your's already.

Well, we I made it safely to UT.  We made the drive in about 2 days getting
to Provo the 2nd evening and Park City the following morning.  Now I am
reminded why they always say that it is much safer to fly than to drive
cross country.  The first day we NARROWLY avoided running out of gas in
NOWHERE texas...and I also got a speeding warning from a state trooper.  The
2nd day of driving across UT on a two-land highway from Moab to Provo was
harsh...it was snowing..i had a deathgrip on the steering wheel while
oncoming cars blinded me with their headlights and john slept.  Those are
just the bad parts but it was well worth the time hanging with John and
seeing the country.

I've met my 3 roomates, Jimmy, James & Thomas... and they seem normal and to
John's delight none of them will be gracing a ""Gorgeous Hunks of Park City
Utah"" calendar anytime soon.  It has been snowing almost non-stop since I've
been here...and it seems that everyone is off to ski or board here in town.
I'm trying my best to hold off until the end of the week when all of my
skiing and boarding activities will be free.  I am scheduled to start this
thurs at the bakery.  I'm considering picking up another part time job just
to keep things interesting, but I'm going to see how things go with a 40hr
schedule first.

I hope everyone is doing well.  I just wanted to say hello and most
importantly get everyones home address. So take care all and I'll be in
touch.

Sno-mo

because we (in my rush I emailed it to legal wrong) had the price in it wrong- too many zeros
so it looks like they can buy power for practically nil
no one caught the error before customer signed it
so it really sucks that I have to get him to resign
hope it flies with him

Good news bad news.   The course here in town would only take one tee time
without a credit card.  It is at 10:57  Yuk.  The really nice course that is
just as close to my house didn't have a time until 12:02  YUKKKK.  So I
called Anahuac and they had a 9:32 and a 9:40.  So I booked the 10:57 and the
two at 930.  The anahuac course is nice but it is another 15-20 min. from my
house.  If we need only one tee time we can go from my house in my car.  If
we have two then I'll drive and someone else will have to as well.  Let me
know how many people and so forth.   (Evergreen is about 40 dollars and
Anahuac is about 25.)

"RE: Why Kingwood?","Dear Ernesto , 

Welcome to the pleasure of planning an event for your asshole friends.
This has been a long standing tradition that the person that gets sucked or suckered
into planning an outing for the group gets bitched at non stop until the event happens.
The next step is ""the event"" that will be the turning point of this bitching.
There are two outcomes,
1.	Everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be lessened to good friendly humor
2.	Everyone is pissed b/c they drove 100 miles , they play bad and blame you for picking a bad place to
	play, they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12 hole , finish the round and never mention
	your name again.

All I have to say Ernie is good luck on everyone play GOLF well this Sunday.

Live the next few days to the fullest , they might be your last.

Long live Ernesto

Please read the message below (from Mark).  He asked about it, I looked it
up and got us a tee time.  If anybody wants to get a tee time somewhere
else, that is fine with me.  Just let me know so that I can cancel the tee
times in Kingwood.

With Richard playing and the boys from Austin playing, I think that Kingwood
is a happy medium.  We could try Brock park if that's what you guys want.
Who the hell lives by Brock?  I actually think that the drive to Kingwood is
better than the drive into 5th ward or whatever ward it is.

I don't mind making a drive to play in Austin or Beaumont or Katy.  It's
golf!!!!

I was forwarded the message you left for Joe Hunter regarding the Chase situation.  I have contacted legal to discuss Enron generating the confirmations for EOL deals.  Was it Greg Crowley at Chase that you spoke with regarding this?  I just need to give Mark Taylor the right name.  

Also, FYI, Joe is longer with the confirms group. Going forward, I can help you with any issues you have regarding financial confirms.

TAGG no: VW1398.1 
EOL no: 1707177

We signed in error their confirmation showing 450,000 per month, but they legally agreed to 465,000 by clicking on the EOL trade.

Sorry that error slipped through.

"RE: Questions for the Simulation Model","Question 1:
When we talk about ""the market"" reacting to events, what are the prices
that we are talking about? From a simulation standpoint, I am trying to
figure out what prices we need to show as being affected by these many
events.  Is it the forward curve? Is it the spot market price?  Is the
bid/offer prices for the various instruments? And, if we are having users
trade basis, we will need different prices for different locations, right?

[Quigley, Dutch]  
for each event we need to build a change matrix that will change the previous price curve to a new one
depending on each event it could change all parts of the sport and forward curve

Question 2:
Given that the calculation of VaR is rather involved, we decided that it
would not be worth our effort to have that calculation in the model.
However, we understand that the user needs to 1) know their VaR and 2) know
that they need to make sure they stay within their VaR limit.  So, we will
need to set a VaR limit for the user and ""fake"" the individual VaR to
reflect their risk exposure.

I had a talk with Erro McLaughlin about this.  He made a good point that if
our user are not expected to understand the complexity of how a VaR is
calculated, will they know how to control their VaR, i.e. if a user sees
that he is over his VaR limit, what should he do to get it back within the
limit.  Is is as simple as not being too long or too short? And if that is
the case, would it be sufficient to use position reports/tallies as a proxy
for risk exposure, instead of VaR?

One possible way to fake VaR may be to adjust the VaR number to reflect how
exposed the user is. So if they are X dollars long, they have a VaR of Y.
If they change their position so that they are now 1.5X long, they have a
VaR of 1.5Y.  Perhaps we can also throw in a factor that takes into account
market volatility.

What are your thoughts?

[Quigley, Dutch]  
Instead of a VaR number we could set position limits that they must stay within at all times
i.e. over all position can not be outside a set range , NYMEX Risk can not exceed +/- 500 contracts
Basis & Index Risk can not exceed +/- 1000 contracts so for and so on 
Therefore not having to calculate VaR and expect the user to understand what to do to stay with in limits




Lastly, when could you meet with me next week? I would really like to meet
on Tuesday, if possible.

[Quigley, Dutch]  
can you check with your team , I am to meet with them on Monday and Tues. so see if you can squeeze into one of the times or we can make a new one

There are 14 teams.
Even with Dutch's version, you will still have someone that kept the 5th
franchise player getting the 15th pick, while someone that did not keep a
franchise player, but had the first pick in the supplemental round getting
the 6th pick and the 28th pick.  I don't think that is fair.  We have always
voted on rules changes for the next year at the current years draft.  I
don't think we should make an exception now to the rule.

Dutch,

I am working on pulling together due diligence information for Global Finance in regards to ENA trading activity.  One number that stood out to us on the ENA PRMA detail was the Q4 2000 settlement of approximately negative $500MM.  We discussed possible reasons for this figure with the ENA accounting group, and they suggested it might be the Dec 2000 Nymex settlement, which was more that negative $600MM.  They suggested that I could contact you for further insight.  Would you have a few minutes sometime today to talk about that settlement?

Thanks,
Ben

Subject: Assistance for Former Employees



Many of you have friends who are no longer with the company, so we wanted to provide you an overview of continuing efforts to assist Enron's former employees.

CAREER SERVICES 
Last December Enron established a website to assist former employees identify jobs in Houston and throughout the United States.  Only former Enron employees and potential employers can access the site, <http://careerservices.enron.com/>

On this site, former employees can: 
        ? Post their resumes for approved employers to view 
        ? View job postings 
        ? Receive updates and information on career and community services available to them 
As of January 25, 2002: 
        ? More than 1,300 companies had been approved to view resumes 
        ? Company recruiters had logged on more than 3,500 times to search for candidates 
        ? More than 600 jobs had been posted on the site 

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE 
The Greater Houston Community Foundation 
The Greater Houston Community Foundation (GHCF), in collaboration with the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, the Houston Area Urban League, Crisis Intervention of Houston, and Career and Recovery Resources, have established a fund to provide dedicated support for former Enron employees.  GHCF offers former employees counseling services and helps them work with mortgage companies, landlords and utilities to defer monthly bills while they are out of work.

MDPC Transitional Assistance Program 
Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church has created a Transitional Assistance Program open to both members and non-members who need assistance re-entering the workforce.

Subject:	Questions regarding storage

Hi there Dutch!

How are you? Hope you're doing well.

We having been working on a storage problem that Philip as given us the
framework for.  In working out the details, we've come across a few
questions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's
description of this problem in the word doc below, just for reference.

1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months.  We
understand that since the users are making storage decisions and hedging
future months, they need to take time value of money into account.  What is
actually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the instruments?
How does that factor into user's storage decisions?

2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and then
select instruments to hedge positions created by the storage.  In our other
scenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the Enron
risk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the
appropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the instruments
cover.  In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by storage
decisions.  What risk bucket would storage create a position in? My
thoughts are that if the only positions created are by storage, then would
the user really need only 1 type of instrument to hedge their risks?

Thanks in advance for your help, Dutch!

Ann

Dutch,

I've attached a spreadsheet which lists volumes for a prepay with the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia (originator is Gil Muhl).  The volumes are not ratable over time, so I thought it might be easier for you to cut and paste the schedule into your model.  The term is November 1, 2001 - October 31, 2006.  The average daily volume is around 78,000 mmBtu/day.

I'm looking for your notional offer - This won't close until Q4.  Please call me if you have any questions - thanks for your help!

Subject: Hello!



It's Friday, and I'm here settling Nymex.  I got a phone call from Evelyn Wednesday before Thanksgiving to come in today.  It's o.k.  I don't mind.  I get Monday off.  Just a few notes to let you know what's going on.  EDF Mann, Paribas and Carr Futures London pulled a fast one.  They set the margin at 150% more of what it would have been.  Here are the numbers incoming and outgoing.

        OUTGOING                

                Smith Barney Financial                  $232,499.00 
                Paribas                                 $46,026,588.00 
                EDF Mann                                $760,515.00 
                Carr Futures                            $12,331,010.66 

        INCOMING 

                ABN Amro                                $33,852.00 
                Saul Stone                              $19,800.00 
                HSBC                                    $291,325.00 
                HSBC Canada                             No Margin Call 
                R. J. Obrien                            $12,320.00 
                J.P. Morgan                             $292,827.00 
                Credit Suisse                           $200,261.00 
                

Lori at Smith Barney was not in Friday, so we did not settle.  

FIMAT was not in, and the numbers came out like this.  They were supposed to have paid down on the loan by $2,931,087.24.  I don't know how you handle this.  Hopefully they will do this on Monday.

I know this is a terrible welcome back, but it was something that had to be done.

"","Kevin,

There have been several things change as of late in my life.
One ,  we are not buying a townhouse anymore, we still have to sell our lot.
Kay is going to stay at a townhouse near downtown and as of today i am looking for an apartment.
I came to the realization that I got way off track , as I usually do , with the plan of both of us
getting a place on our own for six months and going from there. I can not tell you how grateful I 
have been for the support both you and Nancy have given me during this time in my life.
I know i have not been at your house as of late and that is due to being off track of the plan.
Is it ok for me to be at your house on and off for the next couple of weeks as i get an apartment set up ?
I will be working on renting a place that starts the 1st of the month.

Let me know

Kay,

 

Thanks for your message - don't worry - according to the leukemia info, jackie will be in and out of the hospital many times over the next two years - most of the time it will be routine trips for chemo (4 to 8 hour visits) and getting rid of infections (up to 1 week visits) - if it ever looks serious, i'll let you know. Thanks for thinking about us and especially my little Jack.

Hi Greg and Georganne,
 
Per our statement from EDF Man today, it appears that we have excess on our account of $9,535,870.00.  Upon speaking to Paul at EDF Man, he told me that no money would be transfered.  He said that someone in their office was speaking to Marty Timmins in our office..???  Have either of you heard anything regarding the wire for today?  
 
I thank you for your help in this matter.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Hi Dutch,
 
Yes, I would think this is possible because the overall margin excess is $24,296,123.00.  Unfortunately, I don't see any ""breakdowns"" on the numbers.

You are correct, this is the related master number.  I would guess that by 9:30 ish Frank should have his numbers finalized, as my report is complete and ready for him to load.
 
I have not been forecasting EDF's number with treasury....if you believe that they will be sending this amount, please let me know so that I may inform treasury.

EDF is concerned because they are worried about the number of positions they are taking on for Enron.  They want to make an additional margin call of $45 million which ENE is not willing to post (true reason: corporate liquidity issues.) According to our broker agreement with EDF, EDF is not allowed to request more margin than the NYMEX requires so we refused on that basis.  EDF may want to reduce the positions they are holding based on their perceived risk of ENE.  Ira Polk, the CFO of EDF Man said the best person to talk to is Marty Timmonds.  I would not call him up and volunteer to move positions but if he calls you and wants to do so, the moving of positions was agreed to as one way to reduce EDF Man's risk without ENE posting additional cash margin.

Sarah , 

What I was remembering was the front months exposures we had at EDF MAN.
	Prior to moves                After
DEC	-2,003			 1,967
JAN	10,502			-1,588
FEB	 1,338			   552
MAR	-7,013			   188
APR	 5,831			     33

the over all position before the move was 1,240 and as of yesterday it is 4,205.

Let me know what the concerns are at EDF MAN and the request that they are making.
We can shift some positions around if the have levels by months that they want us to stay under.

Subject:	Reduction of trading lines by Fimat

Dutch - there is a mess with Fimat and since you used to run John's book and may see something in this situation I do not, I wondered if you could give me any feedback in this before I send it to Deffner.  Thanks, Sarah	


On Tuesday, Oct. 30 Warren Tashnek (Fimat Houston) and Steve Forman (Fimat NY) telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from $20 million to $11 million for Enron.  This cut is irrespective of the $20 million credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line.  (Soc Gen is the bank that owns Fimat brokerage.)  Fimat made this decision based on the following events according to Steve:

Thursday 10/25
ENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat.  The positions came from existing positions at ABN, JP Morgan, SSB and Goldman Sachs.  Generally brokers agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash associated with the moving of the trades. 
Specifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat.  In this case, Fimat agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook them at the trade price.  There was a $10 million variation margin associated with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send on Friday to Fimat.  Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade price, Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the $10 million on Friday.  If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement rate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for $10 million in variation margin on Thursday night.    

Friday, 10/26
On Friday, Fimat did not receive its $10 million from ABN as agreed.  When Fimat called ABN, ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to send the money directly to ENE.  This left Fimat exposed for $10 million on behalf of Enron.  
On Friday morning, Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed $28 million by Fimat.  Fimat sent $5.7 million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc Gen margin line for Enron.  This left $22 million available for ENE but Fimat wanted its $10 million.  This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat. 
On Friday, there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal.  Fimat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE.  The number of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions were undisclosed.  
Very late on Friday, HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Canada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada.  
Based in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community right now, Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer.  
Fimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage houses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron.  Fimat is uncomfortable with these events.  

Monday, 10/29
Fimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron.  Fimat wants to reassess the brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transferred to them and also the positions transferred.  Fimat informed Enron that it would not move money based on brokerage statements alone.  Fimat would not confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later in the day.  This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by 8:00 am as to what cash transfers will occur.  Under our current loan agreement with Soc Gen, Fimat informs Soc Gen by 12:00 noon if money should move so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its discomfort with ENE as a counter party.  

Tuesday, 10/30
100 positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN.

Fimat proposed solutions
$3 million T-bill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf
Guarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE (although ENE has already posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line)
ENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make payments on ENE's behalf

My tkae on the situation:
Fimat is upset based mainly on Enron's handling of expitted trades and bad press.  I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fimat was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering margin lines to ENE.  I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was responsible for Fimat's inconveniences.   I explained that Enron is prepared neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to make payments to Fimat on our behalf.  That issue should have been resolved when the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fine so far.  As far as the confusion with ABN, we were not party to the discussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that.    Finally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper notice time.  I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on an on going basis.  This may have been necessary for them earlier this week but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us early in the morning like all the other brokers.  

We need to determine how much we need Fimat right now.  I am not inclined to entirely blow them off especially sinces I  do not want them to tell other brokers that we are acting strangely and hurt our reputation further right now.  At the same time, no one around Enron needs more work right now and we can not hold a high maintenance broker's hand hand every step of the way.  Let's decide what to do and implement.

Sarah

Dutch,
I just want to follow up on this email that I sent you.
We are getting very close to losing our database access to the EOL database.  I don't have the exact date at this point.  The word we got from EOL is very soon.

If it's very critical for you to continue to run your excel model, you may want to contact someone at the EOL.

Please let us know either way.

Thanks,
Franky

Subject:	RE: EOL Database

Dutch,

We have created a table in our SQL Server database which is almost similar to the one in the EOL Database. 
This new table is populated at realtime from the Tibco Data Feed.

After evaluating your existing eol_macro.xsl query, we discovered that we can not fully preserve the functionality of your model due to the missing REFERENCE_PERIOD_END_DTM field.  This field is used in your macro for grouping and sorting purposes.  We have requested this field to be added to the Tibco Data Feed but have encountered a road block, EOL is unwilling to add to this field at this time.

The next technology currently being developed by EOL will solve this problem but is not available until November.

As soon as EOL-IT shuts off access to the EOL database, your macro will no longer work.  
We anticipate that this is going to happen in the next month.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Franky

Wave is fair but stalling, it had trouble going through 3.30 in auggie but on the nws and api news it broke
other levels are 4.00 in winter and 3.90 in cal 2. My opinion is that it will take a low aga or weather
to push through all three of these resistant levels at one time. Cal 2 was 3.90 bid this morning and then came back off to 3.875 along with winter being 4.01 bid and falling with it. This has happened several times already.

Dutch
How are you today? I hope all is well.
I know you are extremely busy meeting our financial targets for Q4/01. In light of this fact, I have tired not to bother the SME's and provide content for this project via other means. So far so good, but the next step will be for the SME's to review the content for sign-off. Your timely work for review will be invaluable.  

However at today's Status meeting Accenture had the following in their status report:

	Issues for Management Attention
Dutch has not been able to meet with us for the past two weeks, nor has he responded to our e-mail requests for information. This means we are relying on Andy for all the detailed trader content, which includes the two most complex problems, storage and transportation, as well as the conversion and arbitrage problems. With a maximum of two hours per week with Andy, it has been and will continue to be difficult to get all the help we need. Proposed solution: ask Andy and/or Dutch to give us the name of another trader who can meet with us to answer our detailed questions.


My initial question to you: ""Is this statement accurate?""

My next Questions: ""What Can I do to assist you?""
			 ""Can you name someone to provide the information requested (i.e. two most complex problems, storage and transportation, as well as the conversion and arbitrage problems.)

Here is what I have provided to Accenture to help complete your assignments and to provide content for your review:
	BRM Text book
	Derivatives I as a resource only
	The slides attached below
	Other course work as a resource only

Do you have any suggestions? Thanks for all your assistance and I know how busy you are & how important your commercial duties are for the company. Thanks

Cheers

But, mind you, I was not absent because I didn't care, or found something better to do.  It was never because I didn't want to.  At the risk of this becoming even more of a love in, you guys should know, as this is apparently the only opportunity we've taken, you are my friends.  And I would like to keep it that way.  I have to go now.  Mark says that that the keyboard placement blocks his access to my balls.

Dutch,

Pursuant to our conversation.

This is the risk we would like to swap out.
This is from your view......meaning if the position is positive ENRON is
LONG to JARON.  JARON would need to buy from ENRON to flatten out.

Cal 3      (572)

Cal 5       655
Cal 6    (1002)

I would prefer to Buy from Enron if you cannot find spreads.

Well it seems that Kevin has already done plenty of work on this.  I'm glad
to see that plenty of people are still interested and planning on being
there.  Dan's e-mail is bouncing back - so Ty try and get in touch with him,
and Jody if need be.

I'm assuming that the franchise player issue for next year will be voted on
at the draft, as usual.  Kiske, a motion to eliminate Tight Ends?

Current status quo - franchise players were voted on at last year's draft
and will be allowed for this season, but we will be voting on whether or not
to eliminate them for upcoming seasons.

Everyone comfortable with announcing your franchise player by August 31?

I'll designate my franchise player as Edgerrin James.
I vote for September 8th as well,  11 or 12 is fine with me.

Michael

Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing
broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Purvi,

Glad to see you working on some good stuff : )

you need to pull out a black sholes calculation and input the varialbles
that you were given
and then call a power options trader to ask for a marekt to check the
resonableness of the model
models can be way off on options due to skew and market conditions

good luck

   I have this little project to do and i need a little help from you...
   (since you are an expert in this field!!)

   ok-- i need to figure out what the premium is on an aug on- peak call
   option for power. Now , I know that power is not what you do, but I can
   use some ideas on how to get started.

   Terms

   Strike price  is $200/ MWH
   Forward curve for Aug is $125/MWH
   Aug 2001
   Foward Volatility of 100%
   Valuation Date is June 8, 2001
   Interest Rate is 6%
   On- Peak Call Option for 50 MW

   SO far, I have looked at some forcasts for Aug, and seen which hours the
   market rate is above 200 to come up with a premium value.  I have an
   answer for this problem, but I was just curous as to see where you would
   start. Anything will work. Thanks!!

   Purvi

   P.S-- also, don't be hesitant to tell me that you have no clue--- You'll
   still be my favorite manager!!!

Hi Denise, Kay, and Dutch, 
i thought i'd say hi before i logged off - 12:42 am.  Amanda has been home sick the past two days and i have been rescheduling appts and putting away christmas decorations. she is doing better and will head to school tomorrow.   
Denise i hope you are taking care of yourself. 
Kay and Dutch - thanks for sending your address, the kids are in the process of writing holiday thank you's.  Any chance you could send or email a picture of the puppy Rex, they would love it and me too. 
Kevin and Jo came for dinner last friday and kevin loaded some cool picture scanning software - hopefully i'll get some photos out this year on the web. 
Life is going good here - i am going to the  annual mardi gras committee meetings and setting boundaries and have NOT volunteered to head a committee. I just answer questions and give details and just talk to people about details.  I am loving IT!! and not overwhelmed. My big decision will be what dress to wear.  Larry is right back into working HARD on these sprint deals after our ski trip.  The kids are asking to go again - even Kyle after altitude sickness- they both want to be in breckenridge!! Larry talked to a friend that has a condo in i think winter park. said we could use it sometime.  any other news:  Kyle was star student last week - made a huge poster with tons of pictures to share with his class.  Amazing to me that he is almost 7 years old.  The art teacher told me that after class last monday he just spontaneously gave her the biggest hug  and it made her day.  He is one special little boy.   
Hugs and love to each of you, 
Michele

Hi Dutch,
 
No, all he said was that he hadn't been given instructions as of yet (7:50).  I've just called him again (9:05), and he said that he was told that there would be no money transfered either way???
 
Thanks!

We are doing much better with interviews (See below). Thanks & keep up the good work. Please complete assignments on time. In addition, we need each SME as a minimum to allot 4 hours a week towards this project, which will significantly increase the potential for the end product to ""Exceed the Mark & Expectations.""

Quote for this week: ""One should always bloom, where one is planted.""

Have a great weekend and I hope to see all of you on the Oct 24th Boat Ride.

Thanks for your great efforts thus far.

"RE: Fantasy Football"," Kevin,

There have been several things change as of late in my life.
One ,  we are not buying a townhouse anymore, we still have to sell our lot.
Kay is going to stay at a townhouse near downtown and as of today i am looking for an apartment.
I came to the realization that I got way off track , as I usually do , with the plan of both of us
getting a place on our own for six months and going from there. I can not tell you how grateful I 
have been for the support both you and Nancy have given me during this time in my life.
I know i have not been at your house as of late and that is due to being off track of the plan.
Is it ok for me to be at your house on and off for the next couple of weeks as i get an apartment set up ?
I will be working on renting a place that starts the 1st of the month.

Let me know

September 8th it is!  franchise players to be named by 8/31!
draft will be 11-12 ish but where?  dan has volunteered his house (pearland)...we can do it at mine (katy)...or anywhere else that might
be more centrally located?
jody has shown interest for years and even held the draft at his place
a few years back (the infamous pool basketball tournament...and the black
eyes which resulted from it....and let's not forget the HAWK/rotweiller -C
 URBY/warlock doberman showdown).  i say we give him the first
opportunity.

jody,
once we figure who has designated a franchise player then the remaining
teams without one have what we call a supplemental draft....basically a
catch up round.  there is one catch for those who pick franchise players....
when we draw numbers for the 1st ""official"" round they pick at the bottom
because they have the best players in hand.

sorry if i'm being the brother at arms but we need to finalize asap.  the cost
is $225????  someone please confirm.   jody, john szallai is back in town
and wants in on the action and i will share a team with him if necessary
or you can???  we also vote at every draft what upcoming changes we
desire for the following year.


ty.servello@cs.oag.state.tx.us

>>> ""Crawford, Kevin"" <KevinCrawford@clearchannel.com> 08/10/01 04:36PM >>>
Malone has officially kicked Stockton off the team...therefore, I will be
jumping to the weak ASS north (A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME) to join Malone
(although our name will change) and leave my Southern team in the capable
hands of my co-owner Jeff.  Dutch has said that he will be back.  Thus, that
is 3 teams spoken for.

S & M RULES!!!

Well it seems that Kevin has already done plenty of work on this.  I'm glad
to see that plenty of people are still interested and planning on being
there.  Dan's e-mail is bouncing back - so Ty try and get in touch with him,
and Jody if need be.

I'm assuming that the franchise player issue for next year will be voted on
at the draft, as usual.  Kiske, a motion to eliminate Tight Ends?

Current status quo - franchise players were voted on at last year's draft
and will be allowed for this season, but we will be voting on whether or not
to eliminate them for upcoming seasons.

Everyone comfortable with announcing your franchise player by August 31?

I'll designate my franchise player as Edgerrin James.
I vote for September 8th as well,  11 or 12 is fine with me.

Michael

was Sept 8...mainly due to the previous weekend being Labor Day.  I would
prefer our usual start time around 11 or 12.  I have somewhere else to be
around 5pm or so.  We also agreed to divulge franchise players and determine
draft order the day of the draft.  If anyone has issues...then speak now.

Just so you don't double up and call Continental - i went ahead and called
to get our new itenerary- we still leave on a nonstop Friday 11/16 departing 9:50pm and get there at 10:55p
On the return- they had us leaving at 6:40 on 11/20 going thru Phoenix and arriving home at 1am
I changed it to leaving Vegas at 4pm nonstop flight to home and arrive here 9pm (this cut 1 hour 20 min off travel time)

Update on Andex VPP - They want to try and close on July 9th (Monday), but it will be dependent on pricing.

We have asked for quit a few updates and we appreciate your help.  Going forward, we will probably want to get a quote every other day, or when the market makes a significant movement.

If you would update the quote before you leave that would be great.

Thanks!

Eric

Dutch,

I've attached a spreadsheet which lists volumes for a prepay with the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia (originator is Gil Muhl).  The volumes are not ratable over time, so I thought it might be easier for you to cut and paste the schedule into your model.  The term is November 1, 2001 - October 31, 2006.  The average daily volume is around 78,000 mmBtu/day.

I'm looking for your notional offer - This won't close until Q4.  Please call me if you have any questions - thanks for your help!

Dan each week though.  I'm sure I'll pay for that now.

Ty, if you can get John Sz. on board, he and I can put together a team this
year if you're still looking to fill a spot.  I need John for sure though.

I'll throw my house in the hat as well for a possible location to do the
draft.

We're 5 min. up from HWY 249 (by Willowbrook mall and the horse track), or
about 15min. from 45N/Beltway, or about 15min. from 290W/Beltway.

September 8th it is!  franchise players to be named by 8/31!
draft will be 11-12 ish but where?  dan has volunteered his house
(pearland)...we can do it at mine (katy)...or anywhere else that might
be more centrally located?
jody has shown interest for years and even held the draft at his place
a few years back (the infamous pool basketball tournament...and the black
eyes which resulted from it....and let's not forget the HAWK/rotweiller -C
 URBY/warlock doberman showdown).  i say we give him the first
opportunity.

jody,
once we figure who has designated a franchise player then the remaining
teams without one have what we call a supplemental draft....basically a
catch up round.  there is one catch for those who pick franchise players....
when we draw numbers for the 1st ""official"" round they pick at the bottom
because they have the best players in hand.

sorry if i'm being the brother at arms but we need to finalize asap.  the
cost
is $225????  someone please confirm.   jody, john szallai is back in town
and wants in on the action and i will share a team with him if necessary
or you can???  we also vote at every draft what upcoming changes we
desire for the following year.

Well it seems that Kevin has already done plenty of work on this.  I'm glad
to see that plenty of people are still interested and planning on being
there.  Dan's e-mail is bouncing back - so Ty try and get in touch with him,
and Jody if need be.

I'm assuming that the franchise player issue for next year will be voted on
at the draft, as usual.  Kiske, a motion to eliminate Tight Ends?

Current status quo - franchise players were voted on at last year's draft
and will be allowed for this season, but we will be voting on whether or not
to eliminate them for upcoming seasons.

Everyone comfortable with announcing your franchise player by August 31?

I'll designate my franchise player as Edgerrin James.
I vote for September 8th as well,  11 or 12 is fine with me.

Michael

that is sweet , pardon the pun
those cakes look great , what is in the casino cake ?
it looks pretty cool

How are things going for you ?
Have you settled into a groove yet ?

This past weekend was great for me.
I spent the entire weekend with Kay , 
we had dinner with my parents on sat. Night
and just hung out the entire weekend.
I have had a very different out look on life lately and
it has been working well for me. I have started to ask
alot more questions instead of always assuming the answer.
It has been working well for me.

Hope all is good with you.

Ed Sacks has the list.  With respect to CSFB, it sounds like we have a dispute.  Trades, my understanding, can get ""done"" verbally and then confirmed.  It sounds like we should pull the tapes.  We should also think of whether the deal agreed to Friday is currently in or out of the money.

Ed, could you look into this?

We need to come up with a list of trades that we terminated last Friday so that we can take them out of our books.    Do you have that list?  Also, I spoke with ""Dutch"" this morning because CSFB left me a message yesterday after we filed claiming that the Friday trade was not effective.  I disagree even though a confirm has not been signed.  How do you want to handle this?

Yes that time has come upon us again - fantasy football for the 2001 season.
I'm sure I echo everyone's feelings about the loss of Rick Pearce.  It's
been a tough summer because of it.  Since Rick took care of much of the
Commissioner's duties the past few years, we are in a void.  That being
said, I want to start this process of keeping our league intact.  Please
respond as quickly as possible and let me know your intentions as far as

(1) playing in the league
(2) preference for a draft date (September 1 which is Labor Day Weekend, or
September 9)
(3) anyone you know who might be interested in joining the league.



Thanks

Subject: Back office issues



Fred- 

There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately.  We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.

2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.  

""I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out"" 
""It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade"" 
""We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for"" 
""We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type"" 
""I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here"" 


From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said ""they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. 

The latest is the most disturbing:

""we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude"" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed

We do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the ""backoffice""?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).

We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  

All the problems are being caused by the following:

1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.

There are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.

Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.

2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  

We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.

2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.

2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. 

3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  

4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

that I did not come across as insensitive in our

given the levels of stress we deal with day in and day out
So- I would like to talk further about it- because if it makes sense
to try and keep going on that new construction then maybe we should- I guess we would
have ""down time"" while it was being built... just hope the lead on our

Ed Sacks has the list.  With respect to CSFB, it sounds like we have a dispute.  Trades, my understanding, can get ""done"" verbally and then confirmed.  It sounds like we should pull the tapes.  We should also think of whether the deal agreed to Friday is currently in or out of the money.

Ed, could you look into this?

Chris:
We need to come up with a list of trades that we terminated last Friday so that we can take them out of our books.    Do you have that list?  Also, I spoke with ""Dutch"" this morning because CSFB left me a message yesterday after we filed claiming that the Friday trade was not effective.  I disagree even though a confirm has not been signed.  How do you want to handle this?

Dutch,

This is the same volume I got a quote from you last week -EEX - Bobwest VPP unwind.

I need your offer on the indicated volume.

Please provide the quote as of Friday night's close (not a current quote).  I think last time you said just use $.02 above mid.

Eric

Kay,

 

Thanks for your message - don't worry - according to the leukemia info, jackie will be in and out of the hospital many times over the next two years - most of the time it will be routine trips for chemo (4 to 8 hour visits) and getting rid of infections (up to 1 week visits) - if it ever looks serious, i'll let you know. Thanks for thinking about us and especially my little Jack.

Hi,

I enjoyed working with you during my prior assignment at Enron as the primary person managing the Nymex natural gas positions
and serving as a liaison between your Nymex trading activity and numerous brokers.

Additionally, I am currently seeking a new assignment as an analyst as my rotation date is approaching and am interested
in knowing of any positions available in your group. I do know Brian who formerly worked in your group as an analyst.

I am extremely interested in meeting with you to review my background after trading hours.

Thanks,

How was the early workout?
I called the plumbing guys- it's all warranty work
and they are getting with the Perry Homes people
to schedule to come fix it..I guess I should just have
called Perry directly and then they set up the times..
I'll know next time

Per our statement from EDF Man today, it appears that we have excess on our account of $9,535,870.00.  Upon speaking to Paul at EDF Man, he told me that no money would be transfered.  He said that someone in their office was speaking to Marty Timmins in our office..???  Have either of you heard anything regarding the wire for today?  
 
I thank you for your help in this matter.

Dutch,
I just want to follow up on this email that I sent you.
We are getting very close to losing our database access to the EOL database.  I don't have the exact date at this point.  The word we got from EOL is very soon.

If it's very critical for you to continue to run your excel model, you may want to contact someone at the EOL.

Please let us know either way.

Thanks,
Franky

Subject:	RE: EOL Database

Dutch,

We have created a table in our SQL Server database which is almost similar to the one in the EOL Database. 
This new table is populated at realtime from the Tibco Data Feed.

After evaluating your existing eol_macro.xsl query, we discovered that we can not fully preserve the functionality of your model due to the missing REFERENCE_PERIOD_END_DTM field.  This field is used in your macro for grouping and sorting purposes.  We have requested this field to be added to the Tibco Data Feed but have encountered a road block, EOL is unwilling to add to this field at this time.

The next technology currently being developed by EOL will solve this problem but is not available until November.

As soon as EOL-IT shuts off access to the EOL database, your macro will no longer work.  
We anticipate that this is going to happen in the next month.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Franky

I realize that to decline an invite is no big deal to you
and actually I prefer to go alone tonight anyway
but could you please be more considerate in your approach
and not wait until the last minute to give me your decision
thank you
