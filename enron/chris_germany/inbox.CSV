Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

Robert, when you get a chance, please give me all the service deal numbers for CGLF k#37393.

Marlene, the new termination date for this contract is 5/31/2002.  If I have time, I am going to send CGLF a termination notice for this contract effective 5/31/2002.  Is that something you could do for me?

Let me know.

Subject:	FW: National Fuel Demand

Hey team.  I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it.  Brenda Fletcher was asking me 

Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.

Deal #		Vol	Buy/Sale	Location	End Term	Book
592845		9189	Buy		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England
223854		9189	Sale		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England

415547		9000	Buy		Nful Niagara	10/31/2002	East TP1
415547		6000	Buy		Nful Leidy	10/31/2002	East TP1
1131708	6000	Sale		Nful Leidy	10/31/2008	East TP1

When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this).  Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space.  I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel.  Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).


Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in.  Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3).  As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price.  I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.

Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal.  That's around $1,340,000.  I'm sure AEC is not expecting that.  Does anyone here talk to AEC?

I am forwarding this to you from Chris Germany to handle. I checked the deal in Sitara and the contract that is attached is contract no. 96017703. It looks like there is paper however I am having problems with Live Link. You might need to check with Ellen for the confirmation.

Chris has asked a copy of the contract or confirmation on this deal. If we have both I would probably furnish him with both.

Re: TETCO ASA and Global Settlement Filing Effective 12/1/01

On October 31, 2001 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation 
(TETCO) filed its annual Applicable Shrinkage Adjustment (ASA) 
and its final Order No. 636 Transition Cost filing in Docket No. 
RP02-36-0000.  Included in the filing were revised rates and ASA 
percentages designed to retain in-kind the projected quantities 
of gas required for the operation of TETCO's system, including 
percentages under Rate Schedule X-28 which Transco utilizes to 
render service under its Rate Schedule S-2.  The revised rates 
and fuel percentages have a proposed effective date of December 
1, 2001, and if accepted as proposed would result in the 
following changes in Transco's Rate Schedule S-2 rates and fuel 
percentages: 

Injection Rate - $0.0020 decrease
Withdrawal Rate - $0.0048 decrease
Injection Fuel Percentage - 0.08% decrease

Actually it is not a new truck.  Had 33,000 miles, Ram 2500 3/4 ton, 4 x 4,
360 Magnum Motor.  Infinity stereo, bucket seats, nerf bars, tool box, bed
liner, camper tow package, 5 speed manual.  Oh, it is dueled out through one
catalytic converter with Flow Masters to accent the sound.  Makes me want to
race!!!  I believe the fuel consumption will be tolerable as well.  Now,
Debbie wants it.  I gave $16,900 + tax.  It is very clean and is Sandalwood,
Driftwood or something of that nature in color.  Almost silver.  I have to
pick up old gray over at Jerry's.  Debbie said, it is going to be hard on me
to sale my old dodge truck.  I said Yep, had that truck longer than I have
had most of my women.  I really need to engage brain before articulating!  I
am doing dirt work and hope to plant ST Augustine Grass by Friday before
rain.  One thing is for sure, the economy is not faltering on my account.
Dow Stock is back up over $33.  Hooray, hoorah!
Needs to go to $41 and then I will be happy.  I spoke with Gerald and he
said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad's place.  We need to
change the lock and place posted signs at the gate.  I may want to put some
steers or heifers up there.  I am going up soon and having the tractor
fixed.  Reggie said he will pay us soon.  He also still wants the tractor if
we can hold on to it.  First come, first serve.

When is the wedding?  We're set for 11/01/01.  Be sure to take your sweety
out on the balcony tonight and gaze at the full moon.  It was sure beautiful
coming up last night.  We used to go out and lay in the pasture on a blanket
and watch for the space shuttle.  I had a couple of hickies on my neck the
day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns.  Just
jealous.

My kid is making wonderful grades and has reassured me she will graduate
within the four year period.  She still has some sort of scholarship but I
am not for sure how much it pays.  She is going to be a kinesiologist,
sports injury therapist.  I think she just wants to be able to touch
football players legs.  She will be 20 on 11/03.  I am really proud of her.
Cindy said Jaime has grown up very much.
You should e mail her sometimes.  I am sure she would like to hear from you.
Jgerma5@aol.com.

At any rate, be careful and be safe.  You should have listened to Maw, as
long as you keep your mouth shut and your pants zipped, you will be alright.
Shucks, guess none of us three paid much attention to that.  Oh, Jeff
Sherrar has a new book out. Rise to Rebellion.
There were some pretty cool dudes back around 1774/76.  There will be two
volumes to this saga.  I am half way through the first and you can borrow it
when I am through.  I sure like his style of writing.  His books are always
hard to put down.

After the split Dow Stock there are 120 shares.

Keep Your Powder Dry!

*************************************************************************************************************************************************

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count. 
Please call Shirley Crenshaw at 3-5290 to register.

Pizza and soft drinks will be served.

"Capacity for June 9-11th","HAPPY Friday (Go Devils)..........

No Interruptible storage on our system for the weekend.  The rising temperatures are eating into our excess injectibility.

Interruptible transportation is available.  I realize that the spread between Niagara and Leidy is tight in June but July basis has been attractive.  I am able to set up contracts for next month now.

Have a great weekend.

Bankrupt Utility Executives Likely to Get Another Bonus

    In a move that may become a public relations nightmare, the executives who steered Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy are expected to be granted huge bonuses under a plan to pay them $17.5 million, doubling some of their salaries. The bonus plan has been fiercely criticized by consumer groups, but has been provisionally approved by creditors. Some of the payments outlined in the bonus plan are linked to PG&E filing a Chapter 11 reorganization plan no later than January, a move the utility was already prepared to do. The willingness on the part of the creditors to pay the ransom is presumably tied to their belief that bankruptcy proceedings will be much quicker and smoother if they are not delayed by threatened departures and replacements. It's not a question of whether they are bad managers, but simply one of expediency.  The bonus plan follows a much bigger $50 million round of bonuses handed out to employees just days before the utility sought bankruptcy protection!

Natural Gas Futures Dip Back Down

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX ended the session closed sharply lower in moderate trading yesterday after failing to break resistance at $4.20 amid bearish speculation on todays AGA storage report. The July contract dropped $0.177 to $3.892, and August lost $0.176 to $3.975 per MMBtu. A tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico failed to develop into a stronger system, which also pressured prices lower. And, most traders are expecting a return to a triple digit increase in the latest storage inventory data, and a return of recent lows. The Northeast is expecting a large injection because of the past holiday weekend and little demand. The market extended the slide after breaking through psychological support at $4.00 and then 3.96, the low from Monday's session. After several days of unusually cool weather, much of the eastern half of the nation will have warmer temperatures late this week and early next week. The most intense heat will continue in the southwestern sta!
te!
s, but the hot weather will move into Texas and portions of the central Plains by early next week, further boosting demand. Also, a tropical disturbance located off the Texas coast was going to be investigated by an Air Force Reserve Reconnaissance Aircraft. The disturbance is expected to move north into the upper Texas and Louisiana coastal areas producing torrential rain. But, the failure of the disturbance to intensify to a tropical depression put downward pressure on the futures. Look for fairly quiet trading ahead of the storage report with a bias toward the downside. Look for the market to rally if the storage injection is less than 90 Bcf, and drop if it is greater than 100 Bcf. The next level of support is pegged at $3.82 and then $3.67. Resistance is seen at $4.20 and then $4.25. Natural gas for next day delivery across most of the US was mixed to somewhat higher yesterday, except out west where spot prices continued to rise sharply. Canadian spot prices were genera!
ll!
y lower. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.04 to $3.99 per MMBtu.

California PUC to Miss Edison Rescue Deadline

   The California PUC is expected to miss Fridays deadline to implement parts of a state-sponsored rescue plan for Southern California Edison. Though the regulators are expected to take up parts of the plan at a June 14th meeting, the delay will allow either the state or SCE if they choose, pushing it closer to bankruptcy. The MOU called for the state to buy Edison's share of California's power grid for $2.76 billion, and for SoCal Edison to issue bonds to pay off old power debt.

BPA to Outline Northwest Power Situation

    The BPA plans to announce today its progress in efforts to reduce demand for its electricity, and will outline possible power rate scenarios that will take effect in October. The rates discussed at the 12:30 EDT announcement will be at 250% - 300% premiums. On October 1st, new contracts begin for BPA's fixed rate customers, although rate and load terms have yet to be set. On April 9th, BPA announced that the region's electricity system was headed for wholesale rate increases of 250% or more starting October 1st unless BPA's regional retail utilities and large industrial customers, including aluminum smelters, reduce their energy use. June 22nd is the last day fixed-rate customers have to negotiate a new agreement with BPA for the next 5 years. On June 29th, BPA will submit its final power rates to the FERC that will be in effect for the 6 months beginning in October.

AES and Williams Subjects of Antitrust Investigation

    The Justice Department is investigating whether AES and Williams violated antitrust laws by agreeing to limit expansion of some AES plants. The DOJ launched an investigation last month focusing on a deal between AES Southland and Williams Energy Services. It alleges that the agreement limits the expansion of electric generating capacity at or near certain plants owned by AES Southland. AES has been ordered to answer questions and turn over documents related to the case. Williams markets power produced by two AES Southland generation plants under a 20-year agreement. Williams supplies natural gas and receives the electric output in return for fixed fees from AES. Last month, Williams agreed to pay $8 million to settle accusations that it withheld electricity produced at two AES generating plants in southern California from the ISO.

Northeast Power Operators Plan Trading System

     The New York ISO says it plans to develop a system that will allow energy companies to buy and sell wholesale energy inter-regionally on a single website tied to each company's market scheduling systems. The effort is primarily aimed at enhancing services for energy traders. Over the past few months, the NY ISO, PJM, ISO New England and the IMO have agreed to share energy reserves and have proposed a plan to standardize their power markets. The technology, called a Collaborative Scheduling System, will permit a buyer or seller of wholesale electricity to go to any one market's website and schedule all of their wholesale energy transactions throughout the entire Northeast.

PG&E Not Responsible for Power Bills

    Pacific Gas & Electric has reached an agreement with the California ISO that will ensure it will not be left responsible for billions of dollars of state emergency electricity purchases the current energy crisis. The terms were agreed to in a bankruptcy court hearing that allow the judge to draft an order to settle the issue. Both sides would be satisfied with a ruling that runs similar to a federal order already requiring the ISO to only facilitate power sales to credit-worthy buyers. With Pacific Gas & Electric seeking bankruptcy protection, the California Department of Water Resources has emerged as one of the only credit-worthy buyers now purchasing power for the state. The ISO has continued to send Pacific Gas & Electric invoices for power purchases made on its behalf by the DWR, even though the state plans to issue up to $13.4 billion in bonds to recoup the costs of the power.

Platts Natural Gas Prices

    Average monthly natural gas spot prices for June fell 24.7% in the US to $3.56 per MMBtu, as continued mild weather allowed storage inventories to build, according to data released by Platts. The June decrease brought the nationwide supply-area average below its year-earlier value for the first time since natural gas prices began their unprecedented run-up in the spring of 2000. In June 2000, the average was $4.20 per MMBtu, 15.3% higher than present levels. In Southern California the average monthly spot price for June dropped by 21.8% to $11.71 per MMBtu from $14.97 per MMBtu in May. Spot prices for delivery to Southern California 172.3% higher than in June 2000 when the average was just $4.30 per MMBtu. The average price of natural gas delivered to New York and New Jersey for June 2001 declined 22.5%, to $4.13 per MMBtu from $5.33 in May 2001. This month's average is 12.5% below the June 2000 average of $4.72 per MMBtu.

To: Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and 
Shippers 

Re: System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive 
negative transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of 
receipts) on its system throughout the month.  Effective 
immediately, shippers are advised to avoid any additional 
negative imbalances and return to a balanced position.  Absent 
voluntary compliance, it may become necessary for Transco to 
suspend make-up deliveries for the remainder of the month.

Additionally, effective October 26, 2001 and until further 
notice, Transco will institute more restrictive practices at its 
pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4% tolerance currently 
allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for Shippers 
with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the 
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with 
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will be held to 
the 4% tolerance levels. Transco will not enforce these pool 
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however, 
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits 
identified above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may 
proactively decrease markets to bring them in line with supplies 
at pooling points.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-
3361 or John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.

I am requesting a payment to Dominion Oklahoma (aka Louis Dreyfus) in the amount of $10,334.67.  This payment is for gas that flowed in Feb 2002 to the City Of Tallahassee.  According to Max Doner, ENA billed Tallahassee for the incremental volumes and Tallahassee paid for the gas.

Doug, Drew, I am requesting the payment to be made on Monday, June 17th.  I will get the wire request from settlements, attach the supporting documents, get Ed's signature, and leave it with Susan.  I assume Susan will pass it on to one of you after she approves it.  Is that how the process works these days?

"Change in Tetco Rates for June 1","  

Hello All-

Attached above are the cover letter and proposed tariff sheets filed by Texas Eastern yesterday for a June 1 effective date.  The rate changes reflect under recoveries in their ASA account which tracks their cash-out mechanism and increased cost of system fuel.  The underrecovery in the ASA account has increased from $22,000 to over $22,000,000 over the period September 1--March 31.  Texas Eastern claims that this is largely a result of the gaming of their currently monthly cash-out (which will likely be changed to weekly in their 637 proceeding).  As a result, Texas Eastern is seeking a waiver of the annual filing period in order to begin collecting the underrecovery through a surcharge that would amount to as much as $.0354 from ELA-M3.  Texas Eastern proposes to begin recovery in June so as to extend the recovery period from 12 months (Dec-Nov) to 18 months (Jun-Nov), which will lower the level of the surcharge.

We'll review the filing to see if there are any grounds for protest / comment.  These types of dollars are usually ""rubber-stamped"" by FERC for pass-through but the filing to change the recovery time period may give us some grounds to protest the recovery.

 The full filing can be found at :  http://infopost.link.duke-energy.com/infopost/default.asp?pipe=TE 

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.

Thanks,
Suzanne

Kimat, I just took the volumes to 0 effective 10/1/2001 on deal 815952.  Should we just delete the lines on the deal ticket for dates after 10/1/2001?

Effective 10/1/2001, the primary desk for transport on TGT will be TP1.

Notice ID: 3144

SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Due to long-wall mining activity occurring under Columbia's Line SM-123 in 
Mingo County, WV, the line will be taken out of service.  Columbia anticipates 
this outage to begin in late October 2001 and run through approximately 
mid-November 2001.  However, the start date and duration of the outage is 
contingent upon the actual timing and progress of the long-wall mining 
activity.  Given the level of firm commitments in this area, Columbia believes 
that there will be no available capacity for interruptible transportation.  The 
following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)

   CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)
                     Conoway           (CNR03)
                     Johns Creek       (CNR08)
                     Canada            (CNR09)
                     Canada            (CNR10)
                     Stafford          (CNR11)

                     Briar Mtn.        (CNR13)
                     Huff Creek        (CNR14)

   Conoco:           Grant             (P1)

The same is true with respect to any Appalachian production flowing directly 
into Columbia's Line KA between Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station and 
Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor Station as well as production flowing into 
Columbia's Lines SM-116, KA-15, PM-3 and PM-17.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Oct 24, 12:00 PM
FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued draft orders Wednesday for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, a pipeline and deliverability expansion at Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and a new ANR lateral to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western PA. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Williams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html>). The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Williams Energy Marketing are all customers. 
Petal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"American Heart Walk","Hello everyone,

My husband Ryan is going to be participating in the American Heart Walk on November 3.  He is walking on behalf of our daughter, Sydney, who was born in May of this year with Congenital Heart Disease.  If anyone would like to sponsor us with a cash donation, we would be very appreciative.  I will be accepting donations today and tomorrow.  This is a wonderful organization whose research saves lives like Sydney's every day.  All donations are matched by Enron and are 100% tax deductible.

Please help this worthwhile cause if you can.

Thanks,

Vicki Versen

Subject:	VNG - TENN - Contract #47

Was any capacity released under this contract in November?

There is no deal number in Sitara with a demand fee for this contract for November forward.  Deal # 429424 has IM - Market East as the Agent.
If we need to pay a transport fee for this contract, then a new deal needs to be set up.

Please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks,

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

choice or something of that nature!

Keep your powder dry!

Subject:	American Heart Walk

Hello everyone,

My husband Ryan is going to be participating in the American Heart Walk on November 3.  He is walking on behalf of our daughter, Sydney, who was born in May of this year with Congenital Heart Disease.  If anyone would like to sponsor us with a cash donation, we would be very appreciative.  I will be accepting donations today and tomorrow.  This is a wonderful organization whose research saves lives like Sydney's every day.  All donations are matched by Enron and are 100% tax deductible.

Please help this worthwhile cause if you can.

Thanks,

Vicki Versen

Chris,

No, it doesn't still exist. They kind of faded away when DOMSP and DOMNP
came along. I have an old number for Ken Kapp of 713-752-4018 which may or
may not help you. He headed up that area several years ago when they were
still active.. Let me know if I can give you any more help.

Scott and Chris--

I show you still have the following imbalances on some of your PALs.

K#36621 Enron Park		Balance: 1,783 Dth long (Activity on 10/17
put long).
K#37001 Enron Loan		Balance: 2 Dth Long (No Activity)
K#37875 Enron Park		Balance:1 Dth Long (No Activity)
K#37876 Enron Loan		Balance: -1780 Short (No Activity)

The numbers should equal out, except that you will be 4 long on one contract
and 4 short on another when added up.

Let me know how you want to resolve.

Corey

"Tenn Pipeline - Volumetric Balances","Rita,

Tennessee pipeline has provided us with a summary of volumetric balances per contract. We are currently trying to work with them to clear out these imbalances and/or parked gas that is on their system for ENA and ENA Upstream.

I will provide a copy of the summary for you when you return. Can you please review our data and verify if we have the same numbers and what dollars, if any, we owe for the specific volume amounts that are in question.

Thanks for your help.

"Enron Update","Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

Processing charges are billed by CGAS and CNR (and Gatherco too).  They would be processed and paid by Volume Management.  Some of the extra $0.03 charges are billed by Mark West.

I'm working on the volume split files for Dec-01 Dominion. We can match it with the status/effective date file Robin is fixing.

Call you soon.

I am interested in applying for the above referenced position.  I have worked in orgination and trading postions for nine years and have a B.S. in Civil Engineering.
After reading the job description it sounds like I am qualified for the position.  Can I send you my resume or do I need to apply online?

Effective 5/1/01 through 10/31/01 we have a 10,000 MMBtu/d index put at Dominion South Point to PSEG.  We can do as much as we want in any month, within the 0-10,000 MMBtu/d parameters, but we can do no more than 920,000 MMBtu for the whole term.  We need to keep a running tally of how much we use.

"RE: Deal for Midland Cogen w triggers","


1.  Does anyone have any idea on how to stop deals 340305 and 332163 from creating an invoice each month?
The volume management team can actualize volume to zero.  (Mark/Rita??)

2.  There are deal volumes in Sitara for the East, Central and West desk.  Should these volumes be zeroed out or should we just focus on keeping tagg updated and not worry about Sitara?  Maybe someone is working on the Sitara deal volumes.
If you would like these volumes zeroed out, we can certainly make that happen.... (Scott, do you know if any decisions have been made on clearing deal volumes out of Sitara and/or creating a new book??)

Chris -Can we get these deals fixed (delete the triggers) so they can be reversed (corrected) in Unify?  We have April-02 out on A/R all ready, but May-02 is still in draft status (we have not closed the accrual/accounting month change in Unify for ENA).

The sooner the better.  Please let me know.

I don't think the triggers are correct.

Ed, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed. Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system.  Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002?  One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers.  We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002.  These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara.

Please check into deals 332163 and 340305 for sales invoices to Midland Cogen.  Max Doner thought these deals would not trigger activity anymore per your note to him on 5/13.  I see where these deals were updated by you on that date.  Are the deals legit, or are the triggers generated legit.  Please let me know ASAP.

Looks like you are right about CNR Mar-02. You can fix them on the tab labeled CNRVol (or call me and I'll come do it real quick).

Processing charges are billed by CGAS and CNR (and Gatherco too).  They would be processed and paid by Volume Management.  Some of the extra $0.03 charges are billed by Mark West.

I'm working on the volume split files for Dec-01 Dominion. We can match it with the status/effective date file Robin is fixing.

Call you soon.

Quetion about March 2002, it looks like the volumes used in the Payment file are the gross volumes from the CNR volume file, not the net volumes.  Would you check on that please sir?

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Hello all,

In an effort to make rate information more accessible, I have created Rate Cheatsheets for Transco, ANR and Transwestern.  The chestsheets include rates for basic Firm and Interruptible transportation service as well as fuel percentages, surcharges, cash out provisions and overrun information. 

More pipelines will be added in the near future.  Let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Thanks,

Jeff

"System Imbalance Notice","October 24, 2001

To: Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and
Shippers

Re: System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive
negative transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of
receipts) on its system throughout the month.  Effective
immediately, shippers are advised to avoid any additional
negative imbalances and return to a balanced position.  Absent
voluntary compliance, it may become necessary for Transco to
suspend make-up deliveries for the remainder of the month.

Additionally, effective October 26, 2001 and until further
notice, Transco will institute more restrictive practices at its
pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4% tolerance currently
allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for Shippers
with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will be held to
the 4% tolerance levels. Transco will not enforce these pool
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however,
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits
identified above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may
proactively decrease markets to bring them in line with supplies
at pooling points.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-
3361 or John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.

"Transco Rate Case","Mark-

Sorry for the delay in getting this to you...I've been struggling to find some more concrete information to rest an analysis on, but until we see Transco's supplemental testimony and the Commission Staff's ""top sheets"", it's very hard to predict where the case will come out.  Following, however, are some known variables that will effect the outcome of Transco's proposed increase:

Rate of Return on Equity

Transco filed for a 15.05% equity return (compared with the 12.4% recently affirmed by the FERC in the RP97-71 docket).  
Transco based their filed number on a restructured ""proxy group"", which was revised by their witness to include Kinder Morgan, ElPaso Energy Partners, and Northern Border Partners (these were added to ElPaso, Enron and Williams).
Adding these entities has the effect of raising the high end of the range of DCF returns from 14.56& to 17.52%
The effect of the 260 basis point increase to return on equity amounts to $61million, or approx. 27% of the requested increase.
Protests on this issue were filed chiefly by the New York PSC and PSE&G.  
The NYPSC Protested mainly the change in the structure of the proxy group, citing the fact that the new entities added by Transco's witness are owned in substantial part by existing members of the proxy group.
The NYPSC asked for an expedited hearing on the development of a new proxy group--FERC declined to establish an expedited hearing but did set this issue for the hearing to be conducted before Judge Harfield.
PSE&G's complaint was based primarily on the fact that Transco cannot failed to demonstrate significant financial risk sufficient to justify the higher return rate. 
PSE&G cited Transco's continuance of SFV rate design as a risk mitigation factor that cannot allow Transco to seek a higher return.  (PSE&G and UGI have indicated that they will be seeking a ""Substantial Shift"" from SFV rates in this case.  They sought a 35% shift in the Texas Gas case.

1Line costs

Transco's filing contains approx. $60million representing their allocation of costs for Williams new 1Line system.
Several parties (including NYPSC, KeySpan, PECO) protested the level of costs, questioning the allocation of over 1/2 of the total costs to Transco.
Transco's main risk with respect to these costs is the fact that the FERC accepted and suspended the 1Line tariff sheets until September 1, making it nearly impossible for Transco to move the system into production prior to the end of the RP01-245 base period.  If Transco cannot demonstrate that the 1Line system is ""used and useful"" prior to the end of the base period, they will technically be unable to recover these costs in this docket.
However, nothing precludes the costs being included in any settlement of the docket.  Essentially, Transco will eventually recover these costs (whether at the $60m level or somewhere near that), but if they cannot get the system up and running prior to the end of the base period, they'd have to make a separate limited Section 4 filing to recover them.

Roll-in
	Mobile Bay
Transco included a roll-in of the $120m Mobile Bay project in this case, based on a previously granted predetermination in favor of roll-in from FERC
The roll-in was protested by several LDC customers, who claimed that the $40m cost over run associated with the project represents enough of a change in circumstances to negate any presumption in favor of roll-in.
SunBelt, Pocono & Cherokee
Transco filed for prospective roll-in of these projects.  The suspension order set out the appropriate Policy Statement to be applied to the projects, applying the 1999 Policy Statement which eliminates any presumption in favor of roll-in and places the burden of the costs squarely on the incremental shippers.  Since roll-in is generally not a ""settleable"" issue, determination of this issue will be dependent on the outcome of the hearing.

The main issue with respect to predicting the rate level for the 2001-02 season is that the FERC Staff has indicated that settlement discussions should not begin until all of the testimony rounds are completed and the Staff files it's top sheets...meaning that the motion rates could go into effect on September 1 before a single settlement session is held.  Transco has indicated that they'd like to speed up the process so they can move rates into effect in September that reflect settlement progress.  

It's difficult to predict the net effect of disposition of these issues--but it's safe to assume that the FERC will act to bring the return number down to a level consistent with the January order, which would knock out 25-27% of the requested increase.  I'll continue to update you as soon as any new information comes in or when I can get a better sense for what rate we'll be looking at for September.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Suzanne

                                OCTOBER 08, 2001

Notice ID: 3163
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED


NOTE:  The following is being provided by Columbia as notice to all of its

identified portions of the system due to construction activities, routine
maintenance, modifications, tests or repairs undertaken to protect the
integrity and performance capability of its storage and transmission
facilities.  The information provided below is subject to change for numerous
reasons, including but not limited to, third-party controlled events and
decisions, weather, work schedules, equipment availability, force majeure
events, etc.  Thus, while Columbia is willing to provide this notice and update
it periodically as necessary, Columbia is unable to represent and warrant that
the specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the
specified dates.

SUBJECT:   2002 TENTATIVE OUTAGE SCHEDULE

In February 2002, Columbia's Line BM-22 in Martin Co., KY will be out of
service due to Highway relocation for three (3) days resulting in a reduction
of approximately 23,000 Dth/d of production flowing through Kermit Compressor.
This includes the following lines: P-94, V-55 and BM-18.

In the spring of 2002, contingent upon the mining activity, Columbia's Line KA
will be out of service for three (3) days due to a coal mining relocation tie
in.  Approximately 100,000 Dth/d of Appalachian production west of the May Fork
valve on Line KA will be shut in.

In the spring of 2002, Columbia's Boldman Compressor located in Pike Co., KY,
will have one unit down for approximately two (2) months for annual maintenance
which results in a 15,000 Dth/d flow reduction.  Affected is Equitable's Hi-Hat
(F3) pipeline, CNR's Boldman (CNR02) pipeline, and Appalachian production
located on Columbia's Lines PM-3 and PM-17.

In May-June 2002, Columbia's Line's BM-18, Line VM-141 and Line V-55 will be
out of service for five (5) days due to a relocation for WV Rt. 52 in Mingo
Co., WV.  The affect, if any, on production is being evaluated.

In July 2002, Line 1711 will be out of service for three (3) days due to a
relocation of the Monongahela River crossing tie in.  The affect, if any, on
production is being evaluated.

The following outages affect Equitable's Beaver Creek (H1) pipeline, and
Appalachian production from Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station to Columbia's
Huff Creek Compressor Station on Line KA, including Line KA-15.

In March 2002, Columbia anticipates an outage of three (3) days on Columbia's
Line SM-116 as a result of coal mining activity.  In addition to the above
listed production, Conoco's Grant (P1) pipeline and Appalachian production
located on Line SM-116 will be affected.

In June 2002, Columbia's Grant Compressor located in Mingo Co., WV will have
one unit out of service for six (6) days which will result in a 50,000 Dth/d
flow reduction.

In August 2002, Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor located in Wyoming Co., WV
will be out of service for one (1) week due to annual maintenance.

In the fall of 2002, Columbia's Line KA will be out of service for three (3)
days due to relocation for a highway expansion project on Rt. 119.   The
relocation is between Johns Creek and Canada, which will result in 100,000
Dth/d of production shut in west of the May Fork valve setting.

Sorry I don't understand the invoices.  I can help with contract pricing for the supply agreements for the plant.  Maybe Rick Hill can help.  He is very knowledgable on this plant.   

Call me at 37177 and I can discuss the supply agreements.

"Dominion Producers","I would like to get the following information from you.  I think we probably will need to get the information for all the Appalachian producers.  I also realize that it may take some time for you to get the EES information together.  Over 70% of the Dominion volumes are for ENA.

1.  Pre petition amounts due by production month for EES and ENA by pipeline.

2.  Detail all deals that have pricing other than index for the total volume.  If a deal has tiered pricing, then I need to know how much gas flowed for that deal.
	Ex:  Triad where the first 5,000 is at $4.48 and anything over that is at index.  I would need to know the total volume by month on this deal.

3.  Pre petition and post petition transportation expenses.  Rita has put this information together for ENA.  I will start it for EES and then get you or Kathryn to help me.  It 
    may already be completed.

"RE: House Papers","Hey Squat Low,

Debbie and I went for a Booze Cruise last Saturday Night up the Bernard.  My
Buddy has a 95 Mastercraft which is immaculate.  Man, that is a nice boat.
His son does the bare foot thing and ski boarding.  Man, I told Jerry there
are a million more homes on the river than I remember.  I don't remember the
banks being that high either.  Hey, Debbie's parents are selling their home
on the Bernard.  It is down close to the mouth.  The are approximately two
hundred yards up and across the river from Perry's windmills.  The house is
about 1400 square feet upstairs, two be, open living, dining, kitchen, one
bath.  Garage and small efficiency apartment downstairs with bath room.
There is river frontage with canal frontage down the south side of lot.  I
think it is listed for $140/152 k.  Hopefully it will sell pronto.  How much
is the insurance and taxes all together, please itemize!  Time to head out
to God's Country.  My second light bill was $58.  I have not moved the
washer and dryer into the house as of yet.  I still have to buy a gas dryer.
We keep the thermostat on 76 until bedtime.  I turn it down to 75 so it will
be sort of snuggly!   Hmmmhuuu!  See you in the funnies.

Keep your powder dry!!!

Be Safe!

Guess what?  The house is unsured through July 21st or 24th or something
like that.  I went digging through the papers last night and found it.
Guess who the Goober was that paid it last year???? me.

What I don't have are papers on the Silver Leaf resort thingy.  I mean I
don't have a stitch.  That's ok - I mailed them a letter yesterday.  I'm
going to try to get a gazillion bucks for it and leave you guys high and
dry!   Whoooo hooo - Brazil (because of the ladies) here I

Movies I want to see - Swordfish (John Travolta), The Mummy II, and a
new Jet Li (kung fu dude) movie.

I'm still looking for a bay boat fella's - about 17-19 ft long with a
70-115hp motor.  I'm willing to spend up to $6,000.00.

Subject:	FERC Rejects FTW Rates for Transco -- Again

FYI.



NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  published : June 5, 2001 FERC Rejects FTW Rates for Transco -- Again  Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. last week struck out again in its eight-year effort to obtain firm-to-the-wellhead (FTW) transportation rates similar to those enjoyed by its competitors.  Responding to a remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the Commission after conducting a ""detailed review"" upheld its earlier rejection of Transco's bid to levy two-part FTW rates on distribution customers served by the pipeline's production-area mainline [RP92-137-050, RP93-136]. It concluded that the FTW rate structure would force distributors to pay for service that's not included in their contracts with Transco. Therefore, Transco's existing IT-feeder transportation rates for service on its supply laterals will remain in force.  The ""fundamental issue"" in this ""long and somewhat tortuous"" case is: who should pay the fixed costs of Transco's supply laterals -- 1) the producers and marketers who contract for service on the supply laterals and currently pay all of the fixed costs; or 2) Transco's firm transportation customers (distributors) who converted from bundled sales to transportation on the pipeline's mainline? The producers and marketers, who transport gas on Transco's supply laterals, favor a switch to a two-part FTW rate structure because it would lighten their fixed-cost burden. Transco advocates the rate shift because it believes this would encourage more producers to attach their supplies to its system. But the pipeline's distributor customers are opposed to being charged FTW rates on supply laterals, which they don't use.  FERC agreed with Transco's distributor customers -- who it calls FT-conversion customers -- in its remand decision. After conducting a lengthy examination, ""we conclude that the FT- conversion customers' firm contracts [distributors] with Transco do not include service on the supply laterals. Rather, the producers and marketers contract and pay for the IT-feeder service [on the laterals],"" last week's order noted. ""Therefore, the 'Memphis' clauses of the FT-conversion shippers' contracts cannot authorize Transco to require the FT-conversion customers to pay two-part rates for service on the supply lateral not included in their contracts. We, therefore, reaffirm our rejection of Transco's proposal to unilaterally impose FTW service on the FT-conversion shippers.""

"Dominion Producer - The Central Pacific Group","Attached are copies of the letters sent to Enron by The Central Pacific Group.  This is one of the small Appalachian producers supplying Enron on Dominion and other pipes.

I'm wondering if we can use one of these letters as a valid termination of the gas purchase contract and what would the effective date of that termination be?

Let me know or just give me a call.

Also, I'm trying to estimate the number of hours required to work on the Dominion producers.  I'll like to chat with you about that as well.

Thanks.

On Nov 13th, I sold 2700 dth to Black Hills in Tenn Z6 for the 13th.  I bought the gas from Hodge on CNG.  I need to know where the gas is if it didn't get delivered to Tenn.  The deal ticket shows that I changed added the deal at 8:50 am.  The volumes must have been in Sitara because Sitara shows Joann changing the volume from 14085 to 11348 on the 14th?  Then it shows me changing the volume back on the 14th.

Lia, would you see if we even nominated the intraday on the 13th to Black Hills?

thanks

From Inside FERC (Oct. 8th)--pls let me know if you want more detail or would like to see the FERC filing.  Will keep you posted as the project progresses through FERC.

============================================================================================================
SOUTHERN NATURAL FILES $245 MILLION PROPOSAL TO BOOST CAPACITY
To serve local distributors, industrial users and power generators, Southern Natural Gas Co. filed with FERC last week to build $245 million worth of compression, pipeline looping and other facilities to transport a total of 359,891 Mcf/day. The project would be constructed in two phases.

The expansion would start moving 320,714 Mcf/day by June 1, 2003, said the Oct. 1 application (CP02-1 et. al.). In the project's second phase, Southern Natural would install additional facilities to move 39,177 Mcf/day by May 1, 2004. Phase one includes 114.5 miles of looping in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, which would be built in 11 segments that range in length from 3.41 miles to 16.74 miles. Pipe diameters would range from 24 inches to 36 inches. Phase two includes 8.8 miles of 30-inch-diameter looping in Georgia that would be
constructed in two segments of 4.8 miles and 4.0 miles.

Southern Natural proposed installing a total of 76,930 horsepower of compression, of which 11,280 hp would replace existing compression facilities that have deteriorated or otherwise become obsolete. Phase one includes ten compression units ranging in size from 3,550 hp to 15,000 hp. Under phase two, one 4,730 hp unit would be installed. Furthermore, Southern Natural proposed abandoning six compressors that generate a total of 9,930 hp.

All 359,891 Mcf/day of the capacity has been subscribed, the application said. During an open season held between Dec. 15 and Jan. 26, firm service agreements were reached with Southern Co. Services Inc., 97,950 Mcf/day, Calpine Energy Services LP, 95,000 Mcf/day, SCANA Resources Inc., 93,046 Mcf/day, Effingham County Power LLC, 58,766 Mcf/day, the City of Austell, Ga., 6,366 Mcf/day, Morgan Stanley, 5,400 Mcf/day, Proctor & Gamble, 1,763, and Kimberly-Clark, 1,600 Mcf/day.

Southern Natural asked FERC to allow it to roll in the cost of the expansion in its next rate proceeding ""based on the considerable benefit to the overall rates of existing customers."" Revenues generated from the new contracts are expected to exceed project costs by approximately $154 million, thus the expansion would result in ""a significant benefit"" to current shippers, Southern Natural said. In addition to the financial benefits, existing shippers will enjoy operational benefits as well, said the pipeline. ""The combination of additional compression and new loop pipeline represents a significant enhancement to system reliability for all shippers delivering gas"" in Southern Natural's market area, the
application said. Furthermore, Southern Natural promised that service to existing shippers would not be degraded as a result of the project.

Re: TETCO Phase II/PCB Filing 12/01/01

On October 31, 2001 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation 
(TETCO) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP88-67 to 
reflect an estimate of TETCO's Year 12 PCB related costs.  
Included in the filing were revised rates under TETCO's Rate 
Schedule X-28 which Transco utilizes to render service under its 
Rate Schedule S-2.  The revised rates have a proposed effective 
date of December 1, 2001, and if accepted as proposed would 
result in the following changes in Transco's Rate Schedule S-2 
rates: 

Demand Rate 			- $0.0100 increase
Demand Charge Adjustment - $0.0008 increase

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Re: Chris Germany's PC","Kim,

Please order Chris a power strip. I was not able to power on his PC because he did not have a free outlet.

Please call the Resolution Center (3-1411) to request IDF 6F4A-B be activated. I would have done this myself, but the Network Team is now requiring a Co. and RC #.

One more thing, Chris is requesting Monitor Arms. If you do order them for him, he will need two sets of Vertical Arms. These Arms can be ordered via e-mail from Reggie Wilson.

Chris,

As soon as the power strip comes in and the port is activated I can come by and complete the install.


If you have any questions please call me.

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="""" BridgeEntityName=""EOLBridge"" Message=""Missing StartDate or EndDate"" Status=""F"" BridgeDate=""20011025170945CDT""}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the ""Bid Week"" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

"Equitrans-Other","Rita,

Ruth and Chris have been working on gathering information on the Appalachian producers. Chris has been working with Wade Price on obtaining actualized volumes.

I know that I handed over the invoice files for Equitrans and Norse to you sometime last week or maybe Monday. I believe that I did not mention to you when we might need a response. Have you had a chance to verify any of the information or locate any of the missing documents?

Ruth plans to go in front of the BTRC on Thursday. If we are in fact missing invoices and/or imbalance statements for Equitrans, Norse, Somerset and EasternStates-can you please let me know. We need to contact somebody in their shops and request this information as soon as possible.

Thanks again
Maria

"Appalachian Producers Update","Everybody got alot accomplished today on our firedrill.  Yeah Team!  Here's a quick update:

Maria, located the missing ""DRI Operating"" agreements and correspondence.  See the fax I sent to your computer.  The bad news, it is a 1 year, evergreen agreement with 60 days notice by either party prior to the end of the contract year (i.e. 60 days notice prior to October 31, 2002) to terminate.  Looks like paying them for post petition gas and reject the contract may be the best answer for the estate.  She also uncovered another listing of global contract numbers that may be the key to finding the other missing agreements in LiveLink.

Chris, has been reviewing Wade's TCO data and comparing it to pipeline gathering invoices.  I can't answer your question about whether we are making money yet, but we are getting really close to the answer.  He is getting all the data together for the sales pitch now, so that everything will go smoothly next week.  He is also attacking all the other companies that relate to the producers.

Wade & Robin & Chris are working on the Dominion producers to try to see if they can approximate the high level summary retroactive reallocation volume adjustments that Chris has prepared.  I will forward you Wade's email from Dominion that says that any additional detail is tied up in bankruptcy court.  When they get done, we will be able to approximate what the $ impact is in pushing the producers back to 12/3/02.

Your paralegal & Maria really made alot of progress on finding the contracts.  I think we are up to a 100% success ratio going forward.  They still need to go back and try to find the missing ones.  We sent you a ""big gift"" of contracts to your D.C. office for Monday delivery.  

NY Ed begged me to make sure that the DRI letter gets out on Friday.  I told him that he was going to have to argue 120 new cases in front of the court.  Hee Hee

Our Ed is taking vacation on Friday, June 28th.  We will need to make sure everything gets done so that the letter can be signed on Thursday.

I did not get anything done on the other things we discussed yesterday.

Have a great weekend,
Ruth

I hope you are all doing well. We will begin Giving Tree 2001 later this
month. Giving Tree is when we allow listeners to submit names of people who
are in need. Then we announce those needs on the air. Listeners that can
meet those needs call in and we match them up together. Last year over 300
families were helped. We are in need of volunteers to help us with this
project. We need data entry volunteers and phone volunteers. Volunteers are
needed to volunteer 3 hours a week for the duration of Giving Tree. You can
volunteer more than once a week if you would like to. Please email or call
me if you are able to be a Giving Tree Volunteer, or if you have any
questions about being a Giving Tree Volunteer.
Thanks,

bankruptcy.

And I do appreciate the job offer, its just hard to do with a family.  But

I don't think the triggers are correct.

Ed, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed. Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system.  Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002?  One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers.  We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002.  These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara.

Actually I am.  The little woman and the little bundle of joy both sleep in 
the other room.  Makes it easy for me.  My woman is trying to breastfeed.  I 
can't tell you how stressfull that has been.  There needs to be a class for 
guys on how to best support their ""Woman"" after birth.

Ahhh, my little bundle of joy is cute though.  And her mom lives in town and 
spends a lot of time over at out place which works out great.  We can go out 
for dinner pretty easy.  A lot of people don't seem to have that.  Judy said 
she would baby sit but it's not worth the trip to the edge of the earth in 
Katy.

"NNG Deals","I work with Louis Dicarlo in Ed McMicahels group.  

Louis gave me some Northern Natural Gas Company (NNG) deals to research and he suggested that I talk to you if I have any questions.

According to Louis, when NNG did a deal with ENA, the deal would be booked under the counter party name RISKMANTRA.  It appears that deal number NK7775.1 is a swap between NNG and ENA.  I spoke to Morgan Gottsponer at NNG last week and he said he was hedging some of the NNG storage positions.  I've pulled the confirmation for this deal out of the zip file attachment so you can see it.  Unless you object, I'm going to ask risk management to change the counter party to RISKMANTRA in tagg.  

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.  I have some other items that deal with NNG and Enron Compression Services that I may ask you questions about but I'm still doing my research.

Thanks.

NK7775.1
This Confirm was sent to the counterparty but it is not showing that we received an executed copy back


EE9092.1 (Sitara# 10258, no confirms on file, in TAGG & in Sitara & DCAF, states that this is a rebooking of E23290.1)
EE9092.3 (TAGG states that this is a rebooking of E23290.4, as part of E23290.1; no confirms on file)


E23290.1 (states ""Retrofit - Oracle  #52730.IB, 15419.02"") 1/8/98

This LOOKS (at least as far as I can tell) like the volumes are a result of the Fuel Load need to support X HP hours for the compressor, this is echoed by a memo related to E23290 (looks like someone did an inquiry into this in 10/1995. I did a very quick scan of these ""agreements"" & it appears as all this looks to be gas for the ""Hubbard Station"" compressor fuel requirements (there is an Exhibit C that calcs out HP-hours into fuel requirements). Other than the SWAP confirms - - - - and this ""agreement"" I could not find anything else other than deal tkts. 

The ""Agreement"" progression (for the Compression Services Agreement) goes like this:
3/1/95 Compression Services Agreement (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - Amended & Restated 11-1-97 (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - terminated & replaced by 6-29-00 Compression Services Agreement (Fuel Calc in Exhibit B).
The Fuel needs are found in the exhibits. 

So, id according to the notes in TAGG & if all of these roll back to E23290 - - - - - here is your paperwork

Subject:	LIP pool



Mr. Cooper,

First, I would like to thank you for all that you have done so far while here at Enron.  Although it has been difficult to continually hear one bad news story after another, it has been refreshing to finally learn the truth and be given the opportunity to make judgments and decisions based upon reality rather than some pipe dream that was being offered.  I truly feel that with your leadership, Enron is heading in the right direction and is slowly making progress in building back credibility.  

Second, as an employee in the LIP pool, I do however, have a couple of questions.  It has now been over three weeks since we received an update from Robert Jones regarding reaching the first $500,000,000 milestone.  In that update it was mentioned that there were some administrative issues that needed to be addressed with regards to the first distribution.  Are we any closer to resolving those issues and do we have an estimated time for that first distribution?  Second, do we have any idea today of how much money has overall been brought in to the estate that is to be used in determining the funding of the LIP pool?

Thank you so much for your time.

Kathy Kelly

P.S. We are greatly appreciative and happy about the reinstatement of the 401K matching.  Thanks again!

   Scott and Chris--

   I show you still have the following imbalances on some of your PALs.

   K#36621 Enron Park          Balance: 1,783 Dth long (Activity on 10/17
   put long).
   K#37001 Enron Loan          Balance: 2 Dth Long (No Activity)
   K#37875 Enron Park          Balance:1 Dth Long (No Activity)
   K#37876 Enron Loan          Balance: -1780 Short (No Activity)

   The numbers should equal out, except that you will be 4 long on one
   contract
   and 4 short on another when added up.

   Let me know how you want to resolve.

   Corey

Subject:	FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Oct 24, 12:00 PM
FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued draft orders Wednesday for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, a pipeline and deliverability expansion at Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and a new ANR lateral to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western PA. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Williams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html>). The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Williams Energy Marketing are all customers. 
Petal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.

Subject:	Iroq/Tenn on Nov 13th

On Nov 13th, I sold 2700 dth to Black Hills in Tenn Z6 for the 13th.  I bought the gas from Hodge on CNG.  I need to know where the gas is if it didn't get delivered to Tenn.  The deal ticket shows that I changed added the deal at 8:50 am.  The volumes must have been in Sitara because Sitara shows Joann changing the volume from 14085 to 11348 on the 14th?  Then it shows me changing the volume back on the 14th.

Lia, would you see if we even nominated the intraday on the 13th to Black Hills?

thanks

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000

Subject: Maritimes Moves Toward Expansion; U.S. Shippers Request 1.3 Bcf/d



NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : October 5, 2001



Maritimes Moves Toward Expansion; U.S. Shippers Request 1.3 Bcf/d 


Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline (Maritimes) said it received nominations for 1.7 Bcf/d of new transportation capacity on the Canadian portion of its pipeline system and 1.3 Bcf/d on the U.S. portion in an open season for its proposed $380 million Phase IV expansion project. Local distribution companies, gas-fired electric generators and third-party marketers were among those submitting substantial requests for transportation services, indicating a sizable market for natural gas reserves from eastern Canada, Maritimes said. 

That sizable market has prompted rival El Paso Corp. to plan an entirely new offshore subsea pipeline that would bypass Maritimes and run from Sable Island to New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania (see Daily GPI, Oct. 3). El Paso said earlier this week the $1.6 billion Blue Atlantic Transmission System would be 750 miles long and carry up to 1 Bcf/d of gas to U.S. markets starting in the first quarter of 2005. 

With pipeline already in place and an open season completed, Maritimes has a firm lead in this race to add capacity. Its Phase IV project would begin service about the same time. Canadian markets have requested deliveries along the mainline and laterals to Point Tupper, Halifax and Saint John. The U.S. nominations requested deliveries of substantial volumes into Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.'s proposed HubLine interconnection in Beverly, MA. The majority of the nominations seek services beginning in the 2004 to 2006 time frame. 

""The Maritimes system was designed and constructed to accommodate the anticipated development of new natural gas fields,"" said Philip Knoll, president of Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline LP. ""Given our ability to quickly and cost-effectively expand the system primarily through compression, we can be ready to deliver new supplies as early as 2004."" The company also expects to add some looping line in Canada for the project. 

Earlier this year, Maritimes and PanCanadian Petroleum signed agreements to transport up to 400 MMcf/d of gas from PanCanadian's Deep Panuke project, offshore Nova Scotia. To transport the PanCanadian volumes, Maritimes will invest C$590 million to expand its capacity to 1 Bcf/d, nearly doubling the existing system capacity. 

Maritimes will now work with the responding parties to determine the need for additional pipeline and compression facilities for the expansion. It expects to file applications with government agencies in both the United States and Canada later this year.

"I thought we spoke the same language?!","Hey guys!  It's been a long time, I hope everyone is doing well especially since I know it's the end of bid week and it's Friday.  Just thought you might enjoy some of the things I've learned since I've been here about the English language.   Hopefully they'll give you chuckle.  

There are differences between British English and American English that I've noticed so far:

Pants are ""trousers.""  Don't make the mistake that I did:   I wrote, ""Black Pants, Brown Pants, Khaki Pants"" on my dry cleaning inventory to turn into the dry cleaners and got reminded that I was turning in ""trousers"" not pants with a smirk.  ""Pants"" are what they call underwear here.  Also, I almost fell over in my chair laughing one day when a girl in my group said ""PANTS!"" and hit her hand on the desk when her computer crashed.  Apparentely, it's the equivalent of saying ""CRAP!""

I went to the grocery store around the block and I was looking to buy some orange juice.  On the outside of some of the containers it said ""with extra bits"" and some said ""no bits.""  I was puzzled until my boyfriend explained that it was ""with pulp"" or ""without pulp.""  

When I go to restaurants I have to remember that fries are ""chips"" on the menu (even at McDonalds), and chips are called ""crisps.""  If you want to get a baked potato it's called a ""jacket potato.""    And if you want mashed potatoes, just say ""mash.""  One of the favorite dishes at the pubs (not bars) here is ""bangers and mash"" which translates to sausages links and mashed potatoes.  

Here are a few more of the oddities:

You don't stand in line here, you ""stand in queue.""
Trash cans are ""bins.""  It's amusing to hear someone say, ""I don't want it- just bin it.""
Country boy or redneck types are called ""wide boys"" or ""barrow boys.""
When you spell things out loud, Z is pronounced ""zed"" and H is pronounced ""haitch.""
Cross walks are ""zebra crossings""  since they are signified by white stripes on the road.  (Pronounced ZEB-bra, not ZEE-bra)
Panty hose are called ""tights"" regardless of their thickness.
Good  is pronounced ""goote.""
Yards no matter how big or small are all called gardens regardless of the fact that they're not growing any vegetables in them.

Well, I guess that's about it for the English lesson for today.  I hope you are all doing great and I'll try to do better about sending updates.

Cheers!  ( ""Thanks"")
Angie

"RE: Deals","NK7775.1
This Confirm was sent to the counterparty but it is not showing that we received an executed copy back


EE9092.1 (Sitara# 10258, no confirms on file, in TAGG & in Sitara & DCAF, states that this is a rebooking of E23290.1)
EE9092.3 (TAGG states that this is a rebooking of E23290.4, as part of E23290.1; no confirms on file)


E23290.1 (states ""Retrofit - Oracle  #52730.IB, 15419.02"") 1/8/98

This LOOKS (at least as far as I can tell) like the volumes are a result of the Fuel Load need to support X HP hours for the compressor, this is echoed by a memo related to E23290 (looks like someone did an inquiry into this in 10/1995. I did a very quick scan of these ""agreements"" & it appears as all this looks to be gas for the ""Hubbard Station"" compressor fuel requirements (there is an Exhibit C that calcs out HP-hours into fuel requirements). Other than the SWAP confirms - - - - and this ""agreement"" I could not find anything else other than deal tkts. 

The ""Agreement"" progression (for the Compression Services Agreement) goes like this:
3/1/95 Compression Services Agreement (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - Amended & Restated 11-1-97 (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - terminated & replaced by 6-29-00 Compression Services Agreement (Fuel Calc in Exhibit B).
The Fuel needs are found in the exhibits. 

So, id according to the notes in TAGG & if all of these roll back to E23290 - - - - - here is your paperwork

OK, we are going to have a happy hour Thursday October 25th at Little Woodrow's downtown 5pm.  Since Mr. Barker has decided to leave the nest we need to go drink a few (or in Bob's case, several) in his honor.  I don't want this to turn into a sad scene, with everybody crying and begging Jim not to go............  let's just enjoy the nice weather on the deck and nobody should feel bad letting Jim pick up the tab  (he is going to be making Dynegy money now).



On a side note, I talked with the manager of Little Woodrow's and he mentioned something about noise ordinance and not being allowed to play accordians anymore????



Please pass this on to anybody else that I left off the distribution.

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

Subject:	Payment to Dominion (Louis Dreyfus)

I am requesting a payment to Dominion Oklahoma (aka Louis Dreyfus) in the amount of $10,334.67.  This payment is for gas that flowed in Feb 2002 to the City Of Tallahassee.  According to Max Doner, ENA billed Tallahassee for the incremental volumes and Tallahassee paid for the gas.

Doug, Drew, I am requesting the payment to be made on Monday, June 17th.  I will get the wire request from settlements, attach the supporting documents, get Ed's signature, and leave it with Susan.  I assume Susan will pass it on to one of you after she approves it.  Is that how the process works these days?

Hey team.  I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it.  Brenda Fletcher was asking me 

Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.

Deal #		Vol	Buy/Sale	Location	End Term	Book
592845		9189	Buy		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England
223854		9189	Sale		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England

415547		9000	Buy		Nful Niagara	10/31/2002	East TP1
415547		6000	Buy		Nful Leidy	10/31/2002	East TP1
1131708	6000	Sale		Nful Leidy	10/31/2008	East TP1

When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this).  Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space.  I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel.  Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).


Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in.  Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3).  As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price.  I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.

Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal.  That's around $1,340,000.  I'm sure AEC is not expecting that.  Does anyone here talk to AEC?

Stacey,

I am forwarding this to you from Chris Germany to handle. I checked the deal in Sitara and the contract that is attached is contract no. 96017703. It looks like there is paper however I am having problems with Live Link. You might need to check with Ellen for the confirmation.

Chris has asked a copy of the contract or confirmation on this deal. If we have both I would probably furnish him with both.

Thanks,

Subject:	New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals

This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

Hey Victor,

I am still having trouble reconciling Dec 2000 with New Power.  The information they have from their Altra system doesn't seem to tie to what we have in Unify.  My contact there, Cris Miceli, seems to think that this gas was flowed on our contracts back then. Therefore , they have no pipe stmts to reconcile to.  I was wondering if you would take a look at the deals they show to see what's missing.  It looks like they have about $4M  in deals that we purchased from them that we don't show in our system.  If you'll call me I give you more details.  I'd like to resolve this matter ASAP. Your help would be greatly appreciated.  I am going to request pipe stmts from Sherry Anastas to support our numbers, but I need your help to see if these deals that they show look like good deals.


Thanks
Darla

OK, we are going to have a happy hour Thursday October 25th at Little Woodrow's downtown 5pm.  Since Mr. Barker has decided to leave the nest we need to go drink a few (or in Bob's case, several) in his honor.  I don't want this to turn into a sad scene, with everybody crying and begging Jim not to go............  let's just enjoy the nice weather on the deck and nobody should feel bad letting Jim pick up the tab  (he is going to be making Dynegy money now).



On a side note, I talked with the manager of Little Woodrow's and he mentioned something about noise ordinance and not being allowed to play accordians anymore????



Please pass this on to anybody else that I left off the distribution.

"(01-366) Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas","

NYMEX announced this afternoon that it will begin trading EFS in natural gas
tomorrow.  Please
read the following memo.


Notice # 01-366
October 31, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division members
All NYMEX Division cleating members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas



The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading
Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange.

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

"Hi there!","Just wanted to see how things were going.  I heard that Vicki had her baby recently!  Is there a way I can contact her while she's on maternity leave? (or is she checking her work email at home?)  

When I talked to you (long time ago) you said you were going to be writing me a novel email.  What happened?  Probably go lost in the mail, huh?  Someone said that Dick Jenkins had moved to another group, is that true?  I guess there have been a lot of changes since I left.  

Anyways- I hope all is well and I hope to hear from you soon! -Angie

PS-  I saw Sean Connery this morning on the way to work.  He lives in a flat that's just down the street from Enron House.  Brent told me that his co-worker lives next door to him.  Pretty cool, huh?!

Re:  East Lateral Line 300 - Line Lowering Project
Notice ID: 3839
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED                          

Columbia Gulf Transmission (CGT) will be performing a line lowering project on 
a portion of its East Lateral Line 300 beginning on June 24, 2002.  This 
project is expected to take seven days to complete.

The only location to be impacted by this project is 4119 - AEP/Equitable 
Storage.  This location is impacted because it is solely connected to Line 300. 
 While this work is being performed, CGT will be unable to accept nominations 
for delivery to or receipt from this location.

A revised notice will be posted once the work has been completed and CGT is 
able to resume accepting nominations for this location.

Any questions regarding invoicing should be addressed to the assigned pipeline coordinator in volume management. It is preferable to obtain invoicing data through Rita's group than to have her group and our team ask the pipelines for the same information.

November 27, 2001

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate

anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,
Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition, and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

May 23, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission (TE) is expecting mild temperatures this
weekend, along with decreases in demand that is inherent in a long
holiday weekend. As such, TE will have limited ability to absorb due-
shipper gas into the system.  Effective gas day Saturday, May 26, 2001,
TE is requesting that all shippers ensure that physical receipts do not
exceed physical deliveries. No due-pipeline makeup gas may be scheduled,
and OBA parties should ensure that physical takes match scheduled
nominations. Due-shipper makeup gas may be scheduled through your
Operations Account Manager.  These restrictions are expected to be in
effect through the holiday weekend.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

I moved to CT after I met a guy. He is from the area, but we met in CA.
So, now I live on the other coast, and I am a recruiter in the industry.
I guess I just could not stay away from it.  We recruit for energy

I am happy that you are enjoying fatherhood. How are things at Enron?

"Netting Agreement Materials","
All,

At todays Legal Staff Meeting Sara asked that forward to all members of the EWS/EES Legal Department the Indices or Tables of Contents for the Master Netting Agreements & Payment Netting Agreements, which are housed in notebooks in my office.  Therefore, attached are the following:

1.  MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS FOR ENRON'S DOMESTIC AFFILIATES
2.   NETTING AGREEMENTS FOR ENRON'S DOMESTIC AFFILIATES (Liquids Group)
3.   MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS FOR ENRON CAPITAL & TRADE RESOURCES LIMITED (LONDON OFFICE)

It is my understanding that Enron Power Marketing, Inc. entered into Netting Agreements for payment with various counterparties; however, I do not possess copies of those agreements. 


                                     

The attachments may be a good indictor of what agreements are out there with respect to netting, however, if you need a hard copy of a particular agreement or agreements, just let me know.

"El Paso's Offshore Pipe From Nova Scotia To NY On Track","
NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Oct 2, 9:35 AM
El Paso's Offshore Pipe From Nova Scotia To NY On Track 
El Paso Corp. said Tuesday that because of increased drilling activity near Sable Island, it is on track to develop a $1.6 billion pipeline to transport natural gas supplies off the coast of Nova Scotia to markets in Canada and the northeastern part of the United States. The proposed Blue Atlantic Transmission System, anticipated to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2005, would be 750 miles long, and its 36-inch pipe would carry up to 1 Bcf/d along a subsea route from the southern coast of Nova Scotia to landing points in New York and New Jersey. 
Noting that El Paso was pleased with the initial feasibility study, E. Jay Holm, CEO of El Paso Eastern Pipeline Group, said the company was ""confident"" it could develop an effective plan. 
Meanwhile, Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, the only existing system from offshore Nova Scotia to New England, has embarked on its own major expansion program designed to increase capacity on its system to 2 Bcf from 500 MMcf/d by 2010. The Scotian Shelf currently has proven reserves of more than 6 Tcf, but experts believe it could contain 10 times that amount. 
El Paso clearly has its eyes set on some of those volumes, but it will have battle with Maritimes, which already has commitments from the Sable Offshore Energy Project and PanCanadian Petroleum. 
""The subsea configuration offers several advantages over a land-based alternative,"" said Holm, ""including minimal environmental impact, significant reduction in community disturbances, and anticipated transportation routes substantially less than $1 a dekatherm for firm deliveries to the New York and New Jersey markets, as well as reduced rates for deliveries to the province of Nova Scotia."" 
Holm said that the ""anticipated rates are significantly less than that of any known current or proposed alternative project to provide firm transportation to these regions."" 
Blue Atlantic would offer economic benefits to Nova Scotia by creating the first access to natural gas in the province's southwestern region and would address the ""continuing increasing demand"" for natural gas along the U.S. East Coast, said El Paso. Natural gas demand along the East Coast is expected to increase an additional 685 MMcf/d by 2005, and will grow to an incremental 2 Bcf/d by the end of the decade. 
El Paso plans to open an office in Halifax and has already retained Halifax-based Jacques Whitford Environment Ltd. as well as U.S.-based ENSR Corp. to begin the environmental work. Also, El Paso is evaluating bids on providing overall project management services to assist in siting and design of the pipe and related facilities. 
Soon, El Paso plans to enter into negotiations with potential shippers and conduct an open season to determine capacity demands before the end of this year. It also is seeking input from various regulatory and government organizations, and is working with local communities involved and special interest groups to ensure issues are addressed about the project. 
""This is an ambitious project and our goal is to identify various stakeholders and involve them during all phases of the development process,"" said Holm. 
When the route has been selected, Blue Atlantic will proceed with obtaining the necessary approvals from both Canadian and U.S. regulatory officials, and El Paso said it expects filings will begin by the end of 2002.

"Notes from DTI Customer Meeting","DTI have reached a 637 settlement with it's customers, they have filed with FERC for approval, the first pipeline to reach a settlement. The settlement includes the netting and trading of imbalances, intraday recalls on released capacity, and other GISB mandates that took years to implement but in reality have no application to the industry.
Liquidity has increased on the system, TTT volumes have increased from 3 Bcf/d to 5 Bcf/d over the last year with a 5:1 ration of physical to traded volumes. 
The interconnect with Empire @ Lysander currently flowing 30-60,000dt/d has a maximum capability of 100,000dt/d.  Empire is now allowing secondary deliveries to Lysander therefore volumes have increased at the location.  Note:  Empire recently bought out by Union from ANR.
DTI have an new pipeline project called Green brier.  A new company will be started that will consist of DTI as part owners and operators and other equity interests.  The new pipeline will flow 600,000 dt/d from Cornwell (interconnect with Tennessee and DTI) and run down through VA, into Granville County, NC.
DTI are offering winter only (30cents) and summer only (13cents) service, the project is designed to compete with Transco's Momentum expansion into Zn4.  
DTI have remarketed all the 55 Bcf of GSS that was turned back over the past year and also reconstructed for 90% of the 2.2 Bcf/d of transport.
Another project they are looking to release to the market is an expansion of deliveries to Leidy in conjunction with Marketlink.
DTI have a current transportation offering, Lebanon to Leidy capacity 29,100dt/d, for one year starting 11/1/01.  DTI are looking and will probably get max rates (approximately 30 cents).
DTI will be increasing the transportation fuel rates from 2.28% to 2.78% as per a TCRA settlement recently agreed to by it's customers.  The net effect of this will be a small reduction in the delivered quantity at the delivery locations and a small amount of stranded receipt point capacity on peak days.  This news has not been released to the market, I'm not sure when this will take effect.

"NOTICE OF OPEN SEASON","
                      COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION
                        NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                                OCTOBER 16, 2001

Notice ID: 3184

                      COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION
                              NOTICE OF OPEN SEASON
                                 Midwest Project

                                October 16, 2001



OVERVIEW

Columbia is conducting an open season in conjunction with CMS Panhandle
Companies (""CMS Panhandle"") that would path natural gas supplies from the
MidContinent production and Chicago Hub areas into Ohio.  Columbia's system is
connected to CMS Panhandle via multiple points in western Ohio.  Columbia
intends to offer this as a ""seamless"" service, whereby Columbia would manage
the nomination and billing service for this linked path between CMS Panhandle
and Columbia.  Due to the multiple transportation paths available into
Columbia's system via the CMS Panhandle system, Columbia is requesting that
interested parties submit their requests for capacity and service in accordance
with the terms set forth below.  In the event the preferred receipt path is
beyond the service that can be provided by either CMS Panhandle or Columbia,
Columbia may look to extend the supply path, as necessary, by including other
transportation providers.


LENGTH OF OPEN SEASON

The open season period will commence on Friday, October 12, 2001, and close at
4:30 p.m. E.T. on Friday, December 14, 2001. During the open season, interested
parties desiring service should submit a request form in accordance with the
minimum requirements set forth in this notice.


SERVICE DESCRIPTION

Subject to the terms of this open season and depending on the interest
expressed through completed request forms, Columbia will evaluate the
possibility of using either existing or new capacity for service under its Firm
Transportation Service (""FTS"") Rate Schedule from its west receipt points into
Ohio, located at Crossroads, Cecil, Maumee, and Lebanon. The open season
targets Market Areas 1 through 9 and 15 in Ohio and Northern Kentucky,
respectively. Columbia would also consider requests for summer service
(April-October), where practical.

Columbia also will evaluate non-binding proposals from existing customers to
turn back firm capacity under existing service agreements that may reduce the
amount of capacity for which facilities would need to be constructed. However,
any such proposal(s) would have to be compatible with the specific terms of any
project that Columbia may ultimately propose.


CONTRACT TERM/SERVICE COMMENCEMENT

The suggested minimum contract term that Columbia will consider is ten (10)
years. The minimum term will depend on the need, or not, for new facilities to
be constructed. Parties submitting a request form should indicate a preferred
service commencement date, with the earliest commencement date being December
31, 2001 (if existing capacity on the Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and, if
necessary, other transportation providers, can be used to accommodate the
requested service).


RATES

Rates will be derived in accordance with Columbia's and CMS Panhandle's FERC
Gas Tariff, based upon an evaluation of requests for service and capital
expenditures necessary to meet such requests.


PARTICIPATION IN THE OPEN SEASON

To participate in Columbia's open season, interested parties desiring service
should submit a request, which includes the following items, by 4:30 p.m. E.T.
on Friday, December 14, 2001:

1. One completed request form (attached), with specific attention to the
   primary term of service, service commencement date, total capacity
  requested, and the desired receipt and delivery point(s);

2. One completed Credit Application Form (attached), to be submitted only by
   interested parties that do not currently receive service from Columbia.



REQUEST FORM ASSESSMENT/FINALIZING SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS

Upon the close of the open season, Columbia will assess the requests for
service. Columbia will evaluate the system and capital requirements necessary
to provide requested service and develop rates and terms and conditions of
service based on the required system enhancements. If, in Columbia's sole
discretion, there is enough interest to justify going forward, Columbia will
notify parties that submitted request forms as to their award of any existing
or expansion capacity. In the event requests for capacity exceed the amount of
expansion capacity that Columbia can economically construct and make available,
available expansion capacity will be allocated on a non-discriminatory basis.

All parties awarded capacity will be required to enter into binding precedent
agreements and service agreements with Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and, if
necessary, other transportation providers to complete the path. Such agreements
must be executed and returned to Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and other
transportation service providers, as deemed necessary, within a designated
period of time; otherwise, an award of capacity will be subject to rejection.
All binding precedent agreements and service agreements entered into as a
result of the open season must reflect an arm's-length transaction between the
requesting party and Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and other transportation service
providers, as deemed necessary. Following the return of executed agreements,
Columbia may reallocate any remaining available capacity (if any), but will not
be obligated to do so. During the open season, affiliates of Columbia shall be
required to request capacity on the same basis as non-affiliates; that is, an
affiliate's request shall be evaluated using the same criteria used to evaluate
non-affiliates' requests. To effectuate a seamless service for nomination and
billing purposes, Shippers will name Columbia as agent for Shipper under any
necessary upstream transportation agreements on CMS Panhandle.




RESERVATIONS

These procedures and the attached forms are provided solely to enable
interested parties to submit a request for an award of capacity. Neither this
open season notice, the attachments herein, nor information provided in
response to questions or requests about these procedures shall constitute an
enforceable agreement. Columbia reserves the right to not make any capacity
available, to conduct additional open seasons, to determine the size, scope,
and cost of the project, to not consider requests that do not provide a
sufficient level of detail to aid in the development of a proposed project, and
to reject or accept materials it receives after the close of the open season.

1. Only in America......can a pizza get to your house faster than an  ambulance.  
  
2. Only in America......are there handicap parking places in front of a  skating rink.  
  
3. Only in America......do drugstores make the sick walk all the way to the back of 
the store to get their prescriptions while healthy people can buy  cigarettes at the front.  
  
4. Only in America......do people order double cheeseburgers, large fries,  and a diet coke.  
  
5. Only in America......do banks leave both doors open and then chain the Opens to the counters.  
 
6. Only in America......do we leave cars worth thousands of dollars in the  driveway and put our useless junk in the garage.  
  
7. Only in America......do we use answering machines to screen calls and  then have call waiting so we won't miss a call from someone we didn't want  
to  talk to in the first place.  
  
8. Only in America......do we buy hot dogs in packages of ten and buns in  packages of eight.  
  
9. Only in America......do we use the word 'politics' to describe the  process so well: 'Poli' in Latin meaning 'many' and 'tics' meaning  
'bloodsucking creatures'.  
  
10. Only in America......do they have drive-up ATM machines with Braille  lettering.  
  
EVER WONDER  
  
Why the sun lightens our hair, but darkens our skin?  
  
Why women can't put on mascara with their mouth closed?  
  
Why don't you ever see the headline ""Psychic Wins Lottery""?  
  
Why is ""abbreviated"" such a long word?  
  
Why is it that doctors call what they do ""practice""?  
  
Why is it that to stop Windows 98, you have to click on ""Start""?  
  
Why is lemon juice made with artificial flavor, and dishwashing liquid made  
with real lemons?  
  
Why is the man who invests all your money called a broker?  
  
Why is the time of day with the slowest traffic called rush hour?  
  
Why isn't there mouse-flavored cat food?  
  
When dog food is new and improved tasting, who tests it?  
  
Why didn't Noah swat those two mosquitoes?  
  
Why do they sterilize the needle for lethal injections?  
  
You know that indestructible black box that is used on airplanes? Why don't  
they make the whole plane out of that stuff?  
  
Why don't sheep shrink when it rains?  
  
Why are they called apartments when they are all stuck together?  
  
If con is the opposite of pro, is Congress the opposite of progress?  
  
If flying is so safe, why do they call the airport the terminal?  
  
  
In case you needed further proof that the human race is doomed through  
stupidity, here are some actual label instructions on consumer goods.  
  
On a Sears hairdryer: Do not use while sleeping. (and that's the only time  I have to work on my hair).  
  
On a bag of Fritos: ..You could be a winner! No purchase necessary.Details  inside. (the shoplifter special)?  
  
On a bar of Dial soap: ""Directions: Use like regular soap."" (and that would  be how???....)  
  
On some Swanson frozen dinners: ""Serving suggestion: Defrost."" (but, it's  ""just"" a suggestion).  
  
On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom): ""Do not turn upside down.""  (well...duh, a bit late, huh)!  
  
On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding:""Product will be hot after heating.""  (...and you thought????...)  
  
On packaging for a Rowenta iron: ""Do not iron clothes on body."" (but  wouldn't  this save me more time)?  
  
On Boot's Children Cough Medicine:""Do not drive a car or operate machinery  after taking this medication."" (We could do a lot to reduce the rate of  
construction accidents if we could just get those 5-year-olds with  head-colds off those forklifts.)  
  
On Nytol Sleep Aid: ""Warning: May cause drowsiness."" (and...I'm taking  this because???....)  
  
On most brands of Christmas lights: ""For indoor or outdoor use only."" (as  opposed to...what)?  
  
On a Japanese food processor: ""Not to be used for the other use."" (now,  somebody out there, help me on this. I'm a bit curious.)  
  
On Sunsbury's peanuts: ""Warning: contains nuts."" (talk about a news flash)  
  
On an American Airlines packet of nuts: ""Instructions: Open packet, eat  nuts."" (Step 3: maybe, uh...fly Delta?)  
  
On a child's superman costume: ""Wearing of this garment does not enable you  to fly."" (I don't blame the company. I blame the parents for this one.)  
  
On a Swedish chainsaw:""Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or  genitals."" (..was there a lot of this happening somewhere?)

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

Subject:	Elba Island LNG Terminal

SNG LNG has made the necessary filing to place its FERC Gas Tariff into effect on the proposed in-service date of the Elba Island facilities, 12/1/01.   The filing (which is 311 pages) includes revised initial rates for terminaling service.  Most of the tariff was approved in the certificate proceeding.  Substantive changes are explained in Exhibit Z1, which is in Set 7 below.

These are links to the tariff pages.  The links will open in an imaging program.  Use Ctrl-Page Up and Ctrl-Page Down to move between pages.  If you want to print anything, use the printer icon on the tool bar above the page and select ""fit to page"" under the Imaging Options drop down menu.

                              PL- RESTRICTION

The work schedule for the pigging of the PL-1 system that was originally
scheduled for Monday, June 10, 2002, has been changed to Wednesday June 12,
2002.  This notice replaces the previous notice posted on Tuesday June 4th.
The implementation of this restriction on Wednesday means that there will
be no interruptible transportation capacity or non-PL1 transportation
capacity available along the PL-1 system.  This restriction will also
require that all deliveries at that time on the PL-1 system be made to
their primary delivery point.  All interruptible and secondary deliveries
along the PL-1 system will be reduced to zero effective for the gas day of
June 12, 2002, at 10:00 ECT (9:00 CCT).  Please give me a call if you have
any questions.

"RE: Bad news","Maybe she will grow out of it!  Sorry I have not been in touch lately.  It
has been sort of hecktic.  Life should begin to fall back into a pattern
within the next week or so.  I want to see a picture.  How does it feel to
be a Daddy?  How is Ingrid?  Hope you are all doing well.  You too Uncle

I have some really bad news.  My little girl, when she makes a frown face,
she looks just like her Uncle Jerry.  I think that's a very bad sign.

She weighs 7 lbs 4 ozs as of today.
