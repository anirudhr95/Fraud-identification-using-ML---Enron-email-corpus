"Re: Columbia Gas of Ohio on CGAS for Jan 00","Since we now feel certain ENA bought this gas on Jan 21st, please path the 
supply deal from COH (deal 153863) to one of those large CES deal tickets.

I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES.

Joanne, to the best of your recollection, this gas did go to CES, correct?

Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and 
replace with this purchase.

Stephanie,
Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please. 
Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he

Thanks all.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...


Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount 
(+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn. 
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES 
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro. 
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend. 
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage 
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what 
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling 
generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any 
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the 
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES 
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES 
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to 
cause unnecessary pain.

believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity.  
I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO 
Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on 
this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport 
expense.


According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these 
charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small.  
Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.

  The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES.  

It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice.

Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 
equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we 
should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal

credit either today or tomorrow.

A friendly reminder.

You were going to give us a list to let us know which transport capacity 
tickets would have to be set up on which business units

Also, you were interested in the ability to create multiple transport 
capacity tickets when you get a new contract.  In the short term,
could the generation of the additional tickets be created on a nightly 
basis?

they will invoke this until after they close the month.

Subject: CKY 6-12 January 2000 - cut 29th 767 dth

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from 
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.   However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.   They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.     When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.   I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.   I 
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.   I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.   I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.    She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.   She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).   I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.   However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.   I told her the price would have calculated last
week.

To make a long story short,  we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).   Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.   
Brian,
expect a call from Chris this morning.

Chris, 

I created two CES purchase tickets to offset the sales in TRCO Z6 that we are 
not obligated to deliver.  THe ticket numbers are:  345235 and 345230.  I am 
not sure about the pricing on these deals, you might want to take a look at 
them.  If you change something, that is fine, just so that the total volume 
is 494 per day.

Thanks,
Vicki

Remember me????  I was wondering if you have an excel file where you keep

I have my old one for

I was planning to create one of my own, but I figured why 'reinvent the

Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I 
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.  
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of 
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So 
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria

Subject: CES Daily March Requirements for 3/31, 4/1 thru 4/3


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   3/31 thru 4/3
.    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date contains 
the
volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.    The AGL volumes are not current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Angel,

Steve Gillespie is managing the day to day operations of the VNG asset mgt. 
deal for our logistics group.  Please include him with your queries.  It is 
my understanding that we are agents for all of their contracts and we pay all 
their transport costs.  In turn, we invoice them and they re-imburse us for 
that transport. 

Chris Germany and Scott Goodell in the Transportation Trading Group  are 
responsible for setting these contracts in UNIFY.  All of these contracts in 
question are storage or transportation tied to storage. Chris/Scott please 
set up the 5 valid contracts below in UNIFY as soon as possible....Contract 
37634 is terminated effective 8/31/1999.

If you have any questions please let us know.

Hi Joann and Alvin,

As you know, effective October 1, ENA became agent for Virginia Natural Gas.  
Here in Volume Management, as I try to load beginning balances and actualize 
volumes (so that I can pay VNG's transportation charges) for 10/2000, it 
appears that the following contracts for VNG/Cgas are not in Unify.

Contract Number  Type    
38079    FSS...Master Contract
35889    x-133 LNG Storage
60536    SST
37634    ISS
53004    FSS
60537    FSS

I would appreciate any help you can give me in getting these contracts in 
Unify as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or need additional 
information, please let me know.

Thanks,
Angel

Willard Kinzer, via his wholly owned LDC Belfry Gas, has 142/day of firm 
transport available on 8/1/2000 for one year, which delivers into TCO.  He 
has released and sold this in the past, as he has his own supply that he uses 
to feed his Belfry Gas market.  (Kinzer is the largest independent producer 
in Kentucky, with about 18,000/day).

His agent, Milton Beattie, would like to know if we want to bid on this small 
piece of firm transport.  He  can be reached at 1-606-679-8812.

Call me or him if interested, and either way, please let me know.

My sources tell me this means NIMO will continue to assign CES CNG capacity 
unless CES can prove they have primary firm to NIMO.  What I'm not sure of is 
will NIMO start assigning CES the upstream Tetco capacity.

Scott, who at CES worked with NIMO on the capacity elections?

Hi Molly,

I don't know if this will effect Enron or not - I don't even know if Columbia
Energy had any firm capacity off of CNG released through NIMO, but just in
case, I though you might like to know about this.

Sorry I am not much of a help here.

SENT VIA FAX, E-MAIL & WEBSITE

NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION:


In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk
will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas
rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment.

If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk
last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara
Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity 
to
you.  However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an
Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG
capacity to you.   The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March,
2000.  Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of 
April.

If you have any questions, please call Dennis Bartlett at 315-460-4042 or me 
at
315-460-4041.  Thank you.

I was running down a hill during my hanggliding class, lost my balance, 
stepped in a hole and dislocated my ankle.  Jerry was taking the class with 
me.  He was laughing really hard until he saw my foot..  If I was sitting in 
a chair holding my leg straight out and facing North, the bottom of my foot 
was facing North East.

I got to ride in an ambulance to the hospital.  I didn't hear this but the 
Dr. told them to take me to ""a very quiet room"".   He popped my foot back in 
place and sent me to x-ray.  I don't have any broken bones but the ligaments 
are probably all torn up.  I go to an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow.  Right 
now, I have an ace bandage wrapped around a fiberglass support.

I think you should buy one of those 4 door short bed Nissan Pickup Trucks.

What are you looking for in a truck?

Are you still willing to provide assistance for establishing New Power to do 
business on the interstate pipelines?  I would welcome the help if the offer 
is still there.  Talk with the appropriate individuals internally and give me 
a call at your convenience. Since ENA is doing all of the nominating upstream 
at the moment, there is not a tremendous sense of urgency.  However, I would 
like to move ahead on this quickly anyway.  

I would see TCO, Transco, Sonat and TETCO as first tier requirement.  CNG, 
NGPL, ANR and Panhandle are probably on the second tier.  

Thanks Chris.

 TMR out of tax deferrals so revenue  was 'only ' $.24 per share / $1.07 for 
year.
This does not include the 25 % of shares they took off market - that will be 
factored
 into first qtr '01.  No reduction  in production for year - and looking for 
increase
in gas production for '01.
   Still looks good for long term...we'll see what it does the rest of this

Yesterday I was getting ready to fly out of Fletcher's at Hobby airport when 
a man asked if I was with Enron (he saw my United Way shirt most of us were 
wearing yesterday).  He said that he too was an Enron employee but had missed 
the United Way kick-off event.  He told me he was one of our corporate pilots 
and we spoke for several minutes since I had someone waiting at Houston 
Southwest airport to pick me up.  

I asked if I might arrange with him to get a tour of our corporate hanger and 
airplanes and he said he would be glad to arrange such an event.  I told him 
that several of us pilots at Enron might be interested.  He gave me his card 
and said that he had a trip for Tuesday but to just call him when we were 
ready and he would arrange to make it happen.  Soooo... If you are interested 
or know others who might be, let me know some times and dates and we will 
make this happen.

I am pleased to announce that Terry Franklin will be joining the 
Transportation Rates team in a newly created position-the Appalachian 
Coordinator role.  Terry brings years of transportation, wellhead, and Enron 
experience to the position, and we are excited to have her join the team.

In her new position, Terry will be responsible for the following:

? Understand the Appalachian contracts/agreements
? Understand the gas flow methods and desired commercial results
? Facilitate set-up of transport/gathering contracts
? Facilitate set-up of facilities/meters
? Create purchase deals in SITARA
? Maintain transport rates coordination role for CGAS, CNG, CNR, etc.
? Review calc sheets
? Maintain purchase pricing
? Maintain intra-month volumetric estimates on CNR/Gather co

Terry will make every effort to trouble shoot and problem solve for both the 
commercial and operations teams.  In doing so, she will be looking to partner 
with the members of the Trading, Origination, Client Services, Volume 
Management, and Logistics teams to improve our processes in this very 
important area.   

Terry will be replaced on the Operational Analysis team, but we may choose to 
realign individual responsibilities to creatively manage the  current 
workload.  Terry will begin to transition over the next several days, but we 
must be very careful to maintain the current Volume Mgmt. OA process during 
this transition time.

Please join me in congratulating Terry in her new role!

We only took 80% of what we could, so we can increase by Market Zone delivery,

Subject: VNG Deals

I entered volume and pricing on the following 2 deals in Sitara;

Deal 418015 CNG citygate with Tenn Prod plus transport pricing.

Deal 418065 CGAS citygate with TRCO and CGLF production pricing and Trco, 
CGLF, and CGAS transport pricing (this will take a while to do).

Do we want to turn the auto-confirms OFF?  I think every time I create a VNG 
deal, a confirm is faxed to them.

AND if anyone has a better was of doing the deals ( should we show these as 
production area sales), please let me know.  The easiest way I can come up 
with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most 
of the pricing done in a worksheet.

We have a FTGSS contract with a MDQ of 40,148 dts.  The primary receipt
point on this contract is storage.  BUT, we can flow some of this gas from
secondary points like Oakford or the Pools.  How much gas can be sourced

You guys may know this already.  This contract only has 1% fuel when you take

We can learn  more about this contract later.

I received a notice in the mail in connection with Columbia Energy Services 
Corporation's sale of its ""Mass Markets"" business to The New Power Company.  
The purpose of the notice was to inform us that effective July 31, 2000 
Columbia would be assigning its interest in the January 30, 1998 ISDA Master 
Agreement that it has with ENA to New Power as well as all transactions under 
it.  Please call me if you have any questions about this.  I expect that we 
will receive shortly a formal consent agreement.

"Re: Daily volumes for 10/26 and 10/27","Maybe we should add another section to Mr. Scott's worksheet for ""Third 
Party""  buy's and sells (like the Aquilla deal #452810) and the deal we did 
on the 7th where ENA bought the gas back from New Power.  Not a big deal for 
October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again 
for the winter months.  I could see you guys buying incremental third party 
gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints.

Example:  You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your 
transport to get it to a citygate.  ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel 
and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.  We should let you know what 
the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on 
the worksheet.

So if we had this tab for October, it would just have 2 deals on it so far.

Comments?

Subject: Re: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the 
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the 
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John 
Singer).  Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the 
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming 
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the 
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, 
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the 
Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours 
and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then 
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to 
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to 
Enron.  

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it 
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or 
not.  Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on 
vacation.

Subject: storage clarification & issues


Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

Natural Gas Futures End Higher

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX closed higher yesterday as traders
sought to cover their short positions due to a feeling that the market was
oversold following the steep decline of the last several days. The June
contract climbed
$0.04 to $4.279 per MMBtu. June rose $0.039 to $4.353 per MMBtu. The market
was basically just marking time until the AGA releases the latest storage
injection figures this afternoon. The AGA is expected to announce an
addition to storage of about 100 Bcf. A somewhat lower injection could spark
a rally because the market has already discounted a triple digit build.
However, an injection of over 115 Bcf could send the market to $4.00 in a
hurry. A year ago, stocks for the same week rose 58 Bcf, and the five-year
average injection is 61 Bcf. Since the AGA began reporting storage data, the
highest ever recorded was 78 Bcf in 1998. If current weather models hold up,
the Midwest and Texas will escape much of the summer's hottest temperatures,
and right now, temperatures are mild across most of the nation. Look for
technical support at the $4.20 level, and resistance is expected at $4.40.
Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada generally slipped
$0.10  $0.15 per MMBtu yesterday, except in the west where most spot prices
rose due to hot weather. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub
dropped $0.12 to $4.21 per MMBtu.

Enron's Lay Calls for Open Access to Transmission Grid

    Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, says that generators should have easier
access to the power grid. Lay spoke after receiving the US Energy
Association's 2001 US Energy Award, saying that today we don't have open
access to the transmission grid, and we could get more power into the West
if we had open access. He says the FERC should open up the power grid
throughout the nation so generators no longer have to pay a series of
separate fees to move electricity from one region to another. He also says
FERC has the authority to open up the power grid in the same way that
natural gas pipeline transmissions work. It's clear we've under-invested in
energy infrastructure in the last 10 to 15 years, and it's going to take a
few years to correct that.

Kinder Morgan and Calpine Offer 2 Open Seasons
for Sonoran Pipeline

    Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Calpine have announced that two open
seasons have begun and will continue through June 1st on the recently
announced Sonoran Pipeline.  A binding open season is being held on Phase
One of Sonoran - which would run from the San Juan Basin in New Mexico to
the California border - to give shippers the opportunity to commit to firm
capacity on the pipeline.  A non-binding open season is being held
simultaneously on Phase Two of the project - which would extend the pipeline
from the California border to the San Francisco Bay area - to give potential
shippers the opportunity to express their interest in obtaining firm
capacity to California delivery points.  Sonoran has received a binding
commitment from Calpine Energy Services for 400,000 Dth per day on Phase One
and a non-binding commitment for 500,000 Dth per day for Phase Two. The
proposed pipeline will be a 1,030-mile, high-pressure interstate natural gas
pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in
California and is projected to be in-service date by the summer of 2003.

Power Suppliers to Meet with California Governor

    Executives from energy suppliers are meeting with Californias governor
today, and several are willing to discuss concessions that include price
limits on power sold within the state. Last week the governor said he would
seek to force the suppliers to accept reduced payment for billions of
dollars owed by the states utilities. In the face of a state investigation
into alleged market manipulation, some generators are willing to discuss
limits on prices for some electricity sold to the state. Williams says it is
prepared to support temporary price controls that would extend through the
summer of 2002. Williams is also willing to discuss a range of possible
alternatives for repayment of past debts owed to it. Reliant will reiterate
an earlier offer to sell some electricity to the state at $20 per MWh if the
buyer will pay for the natural gas to generate the power. Duke Energy has
proposed accepting less than full payment for power sold to the state in
return for an end to state and federal investigations into the prices they
charged. Duke, Enron, AES, Dynegy, Mirant, El Paso Energy, Reliant, and
Williams will all send executives to Sacramento to the meeting.

BULLS CAUTIOUS
In spite of slip sliding natural gas prices, analysts are still cautiously
bullish. There seems to be little incentive to abandon the bullish cause
with the prospects of hot summer weather looming.""This is a weak market, but
I think that below $4.60 you have to anticipate the return of industrial
demand. It's really a wild card as to whether that demand will take the edge
off the current large injections. Over the past month, the market has gone
through a major change. Production has increased, storage  is higher, and
the injection last week at 102 BCF was the largest since June of 1998,' says
George Ellis, broker analyst with BNP Paribas, New York. ""I was skeptical of
 the whole concept of demand erosion, but it's obviously real and when you
combine that with an increase in production, the supply demand balance
becomes clear. There is potentially more room to the downside, but the wild
card is weather and if that kicks in, prices could move sharply higher. If
prices fell to $4.38 then that would be a reason to put on another 25%
hedge. As long as we're holding these prices I think there's a good chance
prices will rally higher. I'm cautiously bullish. I would not be an
aggressive seller,"" he said.

Blackouts Hit California Again

    California residents suffered through a second day of rolling blackouts
yesterday as temperatures soared, driving demand ahead of supply. The
California ordered that as of 3:10 PM the state's utilities must cut 400 MW.
Blackouts had been forecast by the ISO since early in the morning with the
heat coming at a time when many power plants are still off-line for
maintenance. The Los Angeles Department and Power, was as usual was excluded
from the blackouts. The LADWP is not under the ISO's control and has more
than enough generation to meet its demand. The ISO said demand was running
about 1,000 MW above Monday's levels. Earlier Tuesday, the ISO had projected
blackouts could be ordered before noon, but the return to service of two
500-kilovolt lines operated by BC Hydro meant more power was able to flow
south. About 700 MW produced by small suppliers, known as Qualifying
Facilities, are currently offline because they have not been paid. The hot
temperatures are likely to continue today, with the threat of more
blackouts.

The reason you don't see the contracts on the SG assignment screen or the CP 
name on the SG maintenance screen is because the contracts originally rep'd 
over to Unify with Amreican Refining And Exploration as the provider. Global 
Contracts can help you with touching and re-releasing the contracts. Then try 
it again and call me if you have questions.  Trang x36996

following?

Deal # 233091 for Bay State is charging a demand charge every month.  
Accourding to Bay State Enron should not be charging demand charges.  Could 
you let me know if this correct.  Should Enron be charging demand charges?  
Maureen Smith is down as the trader on the deal.  However, I am not sure if

Hi Judy,

I spoke with Chris Germany yesterday and he said that you were going to take 
care of fixing the Oglethorpe deal.  An unhappy Doug Jones from Oglethorpe 
called me yesterday.  He is wanting to get the corrected invoice ASAP so he 
can have the wire to us before year end.  If he doesn't get the invoice 
today, he will not pay us until after the first of the year.  

Please let me know when to expect the changes to come across so I can forcast 
the cash receipt in our system for treasury and also let Doug know when the 
invoice will be faxed over to him.


Thanks to everyone involved for all of your help.  Merry Christmas!

Darla

  RE: Organizational Announcement
  Date: July 14, 2000

  I am pleased to announce the appointment of Paul F. Egner,
III to Director, Customer Services & Scheduling for the Transco pipeline
system. In his new position, Paul will oversee Transco's Northern and
Southern Market Area, Transportation Marketing, Scheduling, Electronic
Development & Commerce, Market Area Operations Accounting, Production Area
Operations Accounting and Imbalance Control.

  This new opportunity comes in recognition of the tremendous
job Paul has done while serving as Director, Gas Management & Control for
Transco, a position he has held since 1997. Prior to that, Paul held various
management positions of increasing responsibility in Gas Control, Customer
Service and Transportation Marketing. Egner joined Transco's engineer
training program in 1984, completing assignments in the Transmission
Department's Corpus Christi division office and in Offshore Pipeline Design.

  His experience in these various areas within Transco make
him an ideal candidate for this position.

  Please join me in congratulating Paul on this well-deserved
appointment.

Anyone who's been single and over the age of 18 can relate to this.

When I was younger I hated going to weddings ...it seemed that all of my

Subject: CES Storage

Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.  
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.

Thanks

Stumpy and his wife Martha went to the state fair every year. Every year
Stumpy would say, ""Martha, I'd like to ride in that there airplane."" And
every year Martha would say, ""I know Stumpy, but that airplane ride costs
ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars.""

One year Stumpy and Martha went to the fair and Stumpy said, ""Martha, I'm
71 years old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get
another chance."" Martha replied, ""Stumpy that there airplane ride costs ten
dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars.""

The pilot overheard them and said, ""Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take
you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not
say one word, I won't charge you, but if you say one word it's ten
dollars.""

Stumpy and Martha agreed and up they go. The pilot does all kinds of twists
and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word is heard. He does all his tricks
over again, but still not a word.

They land and the pilot turns to Stumpy, ""By golly, I did everything I
could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn't."" Stumpy replied,
""Well, I was gonna say something when Martha fell out, but ten dollars is
ten dollars.""

doesn't matter to me which facility we use provided NFUL meter 010902 is set 
up in Sitara.

Richard, issues to consider before Faye makes any changes,
 *  NFUL is an EDI pipeline, how will the changes impact Angie's EDI file?
 *  Will we need to rebook our term purchase - (this should be fairly simple)?
 *   Will Unify need to be repathed since the beginning of time?
 *  Can this change take effect 1/1/2001?

Kevin, I have included Chris Germany and Richard Pinion because they 
requested updates to facility #820006.  There is a note on this facility from 
Chris requesting this facility to be reactivated (10/28/99).  He would have 
to approve inactivation.  Richard requested a name change (4/25/00).

Chris is this still a valid point?

See Screen 3 - Facility #513423 appears to have been created in error.  The 
Norm and Trade flags are set to 'no'.

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Faye

Screen 1 - Note requesting reactivation.

Screen 2 - Shows interconnect with different pipes.

Screen 3 - This facility appears to be created in error, both the Norm and 
Trade flags are set to 'No'.

820006 is set up in Global as an interconnect between NFUL and TCPL at 
Niagara Falls.  That is incorrect and this facility should  be changed or 
inactivated ASAP  before any more deals get booked against it.  I believe 
there is an interconnect between NFUL and TGP at Niagara.
Didn't we have this same problem in the spring regarding Facility#513423.

"Re: Hey Buddy - Transco question for you","We should have included the ACA, GRI, and Great Plains in our sales price to 
Midcoast.  You should still use the $.0792 in your calculation.  Just a note, 
we could have shipped this gas to a zone 4 market, resulting in a much higher 
transport cost, OR we could have sold the gas at the wellhead, giving us a $0 
transport cost.  Most of the time you will use the IT feeder cost ($.0792 in 
this case) regardless of what we do with the gas.

By the way, Transco's rates changed just a bit effective 2/1/2001.  The IT 
feeder for Zone 3 goes from $.0792 to $.0769 effective 2/1/2001, fuel remains 
unchanged at .45%.

Subject: Hey Buddy - Transco question for you

First, let me start by saying I miss seeing your happy face every day!! Now, 
that being said, I have a question!!!

Juniper Energy is one of the producers we are marketing consultants for.  I 
have the pleasure of preparing their invoices for them every months on the 
EI57 meter that is nominated on Transco, Zn3WH (ticket 547342).

The agreed upon purchase price from Enron is Transco Sta 65 less transport 
and fuel.  In the past months, we have nominated this gas on one of our IT 
contracts and the transport fee reflects the max IT rate of .0792 plus .45% 
fuel.  That is what I subtract as a fee from the Gas Daily price to reflect 
what Enron owes Juniper for purchasing the gas...

In January, from the 13th - 16th, we nominated 2009/day from EI57 and 
transported it on IT contract .2774 for delivery to Midcoast Marketing, Inc. 
(ticket 568318) @ Z3-Ethel Midla meter 6083.
This path incurred a higher fee than the other two paths that were nominated 
either to our pool or to Mamou.  

The Ethel Midla delivery fees included:
ACA .0022
EP3 .0013 
GP .0097 (great plains surcharge ??)
GRI .0070
VC .0448 
ZN3 .0331
total .0981

The pool and Mamou delivery fees only included:
EP3 .0013
VC .0448
ZN3 .0331
total .0792

My question is....are any of the Ethel Midla fees passed on to the delivery 
counterparty, Midcoast Marketing, Inc. ? 
Or, is Juniper responsible for paying for the extra fees?

Thanks for your help 

Trish

JANUARY  10, 2001    12:30 PM CCT

TO:  ALL TENNESSEE CUSTOMERS

RE:  HIGH BTU LEVEL ON THE LAROSA LATERAL

Tennessee is encountering high BTU levels on the Larosa Lateral.  These high
BTU
levels have been the subject of customer complaints that the delivered gas
is interfering with the proper operation of various lines, regulators,
meters and appliances located on the Larosa Lateral.  Beginning, with the
January 11 Gas Day, Tennessee requests point operators of receipt meters
located on the Larosa Lateral to tender to Tennessee gas that meets the gas
quality specifications found in the General Terms and Conditions of the
Tennessee Gas Tariff.

The following is a list of receipt meters located on the Larosa Lateral:
010069  Mustang Island 1Dehyd
010184  Redfish Bay Dehyd
010803  Stedman Island Dehyd
010990  Ingleside Dehyd
011476  Mustang Island 776
012021  Red Fish Bay Transport
012566  Mustang Island

Absent resolution of the problems, beginning with the January 11 Gas Day,
Tennessee will not accept nominations from meters on the Larosa Lateral
tendering out of specification gas and will issue an Operational Flow Order
Balancing Alert to the point operator.

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Representative or
Volume Analyst.

Subject:  New Report

FYI
Based on a request by Dennis Bond, a new report has been added that allows
external customers to see the group, name, and description for all reports 
that
they can run.  The report is called RPT_GROUPS_EX (group Reports), and can be
run by internal users as well.  Only reports that are available to all 
external
customers are included, so company specific reports will not be displayed.
Currently the report is 10 pages, and does not include a data file 
(description
can be up to 200 characters, and doesn't fit well into a spreadsheet).  Dennis
wanted to be able to give new customers something to help them get started 
with
the various billing report options.  Since showing all reports didn't require
that many pages, thought it might be helpful to include everything.  Good 
idea!

Chris - We now have a volume problem involving  Phillips Production supply 
and  Power Gas Marketing supply and the Clinton sales.   How do we 
reconcile?  Phillips and Power Gas Marketing are supplying statements to back 
their numbers, and per John Singer, we are trying to use them.  This new 
change in volumes will result in supply drafts for the differences.

We really need a solution and a resolution.  Please reply.

Donnie, for July, adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from 
Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT.  I 
may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables 
are netting to 0.

For August, September, October, and November, make the Clinton volumes match 
the Phillips and Power Gas Marketing Supply and DO send an invoice adjustment 
to Clinton.

Paul, let me know if you have questions.  For July, the imbalance is actually 
in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.  For August forward, I 
believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes 
since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.  Let me know if you want to 
make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want these 
deals to go away.  Oh yeah, and make Clinton a lot of money!

Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I 
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.  
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of 
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So 
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria

In Jan'01, you put ANR gas we bought under 3rd party, but in Dec it seems to 
be only under citygate deals. Is that correct? I know I neglected to adjust 
my FOM volume when those 3rd party vols change. Lets talk about 3rd party

Subject: CES Storage

I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like 
to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several 
pipelines.  Who should I talk to?

On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and 
sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection 
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal 
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what 
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how 
to do it.

Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?

Subject: Allied Deals

In reconciling with CES I have come across deal numbers 144284, 229286, and 
232373 that have CES as the counterparty but in the terms they show the deal 
is actually with Allied.  CES has paid everything we invoiced them, including 
these three deals, but they have admitted that they are unfamiliar to them.  
I have not said anything to CES yet.  Do we need to change the counterparty 
or what action should we take?

Thank You,

Molly

Why Exercise???

1) My grandmother started walking five miles a day
 when she was 60.
 She's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she
 is.

 2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so
 that I could hear
 heavy breathing again.

 3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 400
 bucks. Haven't
 lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up.

 4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain
 figures out what
 I'm doing.

 5) I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch
 our toes, he
 would have put them further up our body.

 6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken
 by people who
 annoy me.

 7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach
 covers them.

 8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you
 die healthier.

 9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing,
 start with a small
 country.

 10) I don't jog. It makes the ice jump right out of
 my glass.

"New Power deals","I extended deal 559947 (Pool sale) thru the 31st, a volume of 27935 per day.

I changed storage deal 456379 from 196985 to 46985 on the 31st ONLY!!

Joann,  for Jan, we are selling New Power 31,679 out of the pool and 25893 
from other sources (AO6, Broad Run, Delmont, and Monclova - this includes the 
AO6 they are buying from us).  Which means we should only have 3844 out of 
the pool.


Actually the citygate and storage should be as follows

Vol Comment
3844 Out of the pool
25893 Other receipt supply
xxxx Storage - and this should match whats on the storage ticket.

Subject: CES Storage

Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.  
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.

Thanks

the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I
will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes.
As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off
Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and 
as
I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm 
basis
with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage
injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the
price for all of the  April storage injections.

Subject: CGAS deal 213360

There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the 
demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 
900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 
310,000  for Dec
310,000 for Jan
280,000 for Feb

Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of 
this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge.  
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for 
the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?

Thanks

Subject: CGAS deal 213360

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I 
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.

Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I 
believe its in the deal correctly.

Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a ""Put to COH at IF"" or 
something real intelligent like that.

This deal goes thru 2/28/01.

was set up to discuss the operational control notices, and associated

request to be able to rank w/in a business party from a pool on the disag nom 
which they seem to think they'll be able to accomplish.  

I'll send out a summary of the Tetco and Transco meetings this afternoon.

Subject: Citygate Production

T&F Operating has sent ENA a ""breach of contract"" letter and is requesting to 
terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000.

Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.

CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999.  
T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away 
effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn 
Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and 
according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.

T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive 
any and all ""cover"" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to 
April 1, 2000.

John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this 
need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he 
should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that question.

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term 
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible.  For your information, 
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and 
prices in it.  I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10% 
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to 
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided 
to us by CES.  

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he 
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of 
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway, 
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in 
by your group (I think you're the right one).  Again, those deals should be 
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.  In addition, I 
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, 
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to 
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things 
are matching up.  I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please 
advise.

Subject: CES Supply Management Agreement

New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market 
customers.  In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our 
relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.  Below 
are the observations  that I have.  I would like to get you feedback on 
these.  If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.

1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.  As such, we will 
only interpret the language of the agreement related to ""existing markets"" as 
applying to only those twelve markets.  For other markets that we conduct 
business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load 
management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the 
agreement.  In essence, we see the supply management agreement being 
bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer.

2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for 
capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.  This would 
include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.  In 
addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.  It would also 
include the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990, 
64939, 65418, 62164.  There are some capacity agreements on TCO for 
CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and 
mass markets.  It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the 
demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase 
commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .  All 
un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I 
agreements.

3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity 
that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 2001.  I 
want to keep this capacity separate and under our control.  I will need your 
viewpoint on this.  If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity 
under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our 
ability to market any excess capacity in open market.  Bottom-line, I want to 
avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for 
un-utilized capacity. 

4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause.  
My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar 
nature and service level. (supply management)  To the degree that New Power 
chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only 
transactions would not be subject to this clause.    

I know you will need to review the contract.  We have some time to discuss 
these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next 
Friday, if at all possible.  I can be reached at ext 39475.  Thanks for your 
help.

It's Circle Bible Study Time Again!.......and I sure hope you will be there.

Join us tomorrow night for another exciting episode of ""As the Relationships
Turn"".
This week we will investigate one of the keys to building strong
relationships.....learning to serve.

Join us for live jazz!, coffee, table fellowship, Bible study, and more!

Bring some friends with you.

""So Jesus called them to Him and said, 'As you know, the kings and great men
of the earth lord it over the people; but among you it is different.
WHOEVER WANTS TO BE GREAT AMONG YOU MUST BE YOUR SERVANT and whoever wants
to be greatest of all must be the slave of all.  For even I, the Messiah, am
not here to be served, but to help others, and to give My life as a ransom
for many.'""  Mark 10:42-45.

""The greatest among you will be your servant.  For whoever exalts himself
will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.""  Matthew
23:11-12

""Now came an argument among them as to which of them would be greatest (in
the coming Kingdom)!  But Jesus knew their  thoughts, so He stood a
little child beside Him and said to them, 'Anyone who takes care of a little
child like this is caring for  Me!  And whoever cares for Me is caring for
God who sent Me.  Your care for others is the measure of your greatness.'""
Luke 9:46-48 (TLB)

See you Saturday night!

1,210,121 into storage for the month of May.  For now, our target injection 
volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121.  When we overinject, like we did 
for the first four days, we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for 
the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be 
1,210,121.

I will try to monitor the deal volume.

Bay State did paid for the gas in full.  We were invoicing them the demand 
charge on top of the gas cost. They just did not pay the demand. So they do 
not owe us any of the gas cost.   
Should there be demand charge entery on the purchase side?

Hello Chris,
Remember the demand charge that was entered in the sales side that you killed 
about a week ago?(deal # 233091)  Well, the demand charges need to be in the 
purchase side not the sales side.  Per Bay State, Enron should be paying the 
demand charges.  Are they correct???  Bay State is also charging interest for 
late payment.  Please let me know if you need any more information.
Production month Amount
April   $14,850.00
May   $15,345.00
June   $14,850.00
July   $15,345.00
August   $15,345.00

Deal # 233091 for Bay State is charging a demand charge every month.  
Accourding to Bay State Enron should not be charging demand charges.  Could

Subject: DTI (CNG) Storage Offering.

I met with Jeff Kiester of DTI yesterday regarding the storage offering they 
have on the market.  They have 3 Bcf storage capacity and 30,000dt/d of 
FT-GSS up for bid by 2/12/01. However there will be up to an additional 10 
Bcf of storage capcity available before 4/1/01 depending on additional 
turnback.  All of this capacity is utility turnback mainly, East Ohio, 
National Fuel and RG&E.
Potential uses for DTI storage:
1.  Desk use - If we buy the storage without the transportation we would 
inject and withdraw at SP.  If we do submit a bid, I would recommend that we 
try to incorporate free intramonth injection capability, effectivly giving us 
a no-notice type service that we could use to take physical positions in the 
cash market.  The current park/loan rate is $0.07 /dt/d, it seems we utilize 
this 2-3 times a month.
2.  VNG - AGL could want to look into adding storage to the VNG portfolio,  
the drawback is that the PL1 line has no excess deliverability, VNG's need is 
more a peak day issue.
3.  Partner with EES - Paul Tate from EES also sat in on our meeting, he 
expressed an interest in looking into potential partnering oppourtunities 
with the East desk regarding markets on TCO and DTI.  This storage offering 
for example could be something we partner on.  I plan to meet with Paul at 
the beggining of next week to discuss further (Dick I will check with you on 
your availability).

Jeff also indicated there will be more transportation capacity turned back in 
the near future.  There will be a posting for 75,000 dt/d of Lebanon - Leidy 
capacity coming out in the next few weeks.  

Market view on capacity release:
With the utilities turning back transportation, the economics of the capacity 
release market will change.  The utilities have historically released 
transportation in the summer months for $0.05 or less (as low as $0.01) in 
order to recover something from their asset.  DTI will now be the marketer of 
the turned back capacity.  Historically the pipeline has been very reluctant 
to sell capacity below max rate in the winter and less than 50% ($0.12 at 
current rates) in the summer.   Jeff indicated that his view is that capacity 
values will increase slighly this summer and significantly next summer due to 
the new power gen load coming online 2002.  As part of DTI's last rate case 
settlement FT-GSS holders can no longer release transportation in the summer, 
that went into effect last summer-00.  Although the capacity release market 
was a little tighter last summer it did not significantly drive up capacity 
release prices in the summer-00.  My view is that two of the three power gen 
loads will be interuptible and therfore will not sigificantly increase the 
overall load factor of the system.  The bottom line is that DTI is competing 
with capacity release and I feel there will be enough capacity release 
available on the market this summer to force DTI to sell it's capacity below 
50% of max rate.  However capacity release prices may increase next year as 
more utilities turnback capacity and the new power generation may be in the 
capacity release market.

Market View on Basis on CNG for Summer 01 & Summer 02:
With the increased load and potentially low storage inventory level going 
into this summer, basis could be strong vs historical prices. However, with 
the inception of M&NEP delivering 400,000dt/d into the Northeast last year 
CNG basis (summer strip) was less than $0.20 in Jan-00 and Feb-00,  even 
though the April 1 storage inventory level was the lowest since 1996.  In 
1996 CNG Apr-Oct strip traded as high as high as $0.31 in Feb-96 and dropped 
as low as $0.21 by May-96.  DTI summer load is averages 2.5 - 3.0 Bcf, I 
don't think the 100,000dt/d load of the new power gen load will be 
significant this summer considering the additional supply coming in from 
Dracut.   However with American National Power Inc (34,000Dth/d) and El Paso 
Gas Services Co (139,000dt/d) both coming online in 2001, that have 
contracted for around half of the Dracut supply, this may cause sumer basis 
prices to increase from current levels (Apr-01-Oct-01 strip $0.33) this 
summer and depending on storage inventories 4/1/02,  Apr-Oct-02 basis may be 
also get stronger.

Dick, I don't have this deal in my records as a sale to CES.  When you get 
back, let's look at your deal sheet and see if there are any notes.

deal. I will keep you posted. Thanks, Rob

Chris, Deal # 153683, Please take a look at this and see if you can confirm 
that this was Buy/Sell or incremental. CES or EES? I have a supply but no

Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and 
replace with this purchase.

Stephanie,
Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please. 
Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he 
needs to get this pathed in the system.

Thanks all.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...


Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

Subject: Re: Allied Signal Buyback - 90,000 - UPDATE  

This is the true amount that Enron is buying back from Allied.

mainline to leach to allied = 12809/12426/12163
tco pool to allied  = 2898/2837

Total delivery cut  = 12163+2837 = 15,000
Total at pool  = 12426+2898 = 15,324

By golly.... the 15,000 grossed up is 15,324. Chris, thinking you want the 
15,324 on the ticket for the 5 days. John ... do you agree too?!?!  The deal 
ticket is 225366.

In case anyone cares.... did the SIT withdrawal nom's to Allied Plant on the 
FTS idle capacity. Effective 3/24 to 3/29. This will better help match the 
burns for Allied.

39095/84 was = 0  now = 12163

John, per voicemail. Reduced deliveries to Allied Plant by 90,000 or

39095/124  was = 12809/12426/12163 now = 0  (super nom from mainline pool to 
Allied plant)
37862/14  was = 0    now = 12809/12426 (mainline to leach)
37147/2478 was = 0   now = 12426/12426 (leach to TCO)
62672/12  was = 3405/3333  now = 507/496 (TCO agg to Allied plant)

Total reduced to Allied Plant:

39095/14  12163 reduction
62672/12  2837  reduction

Total  15,000 reduction

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR (deal 136749) at ANR IF 
+.01.  and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS (deal 149838) at CGAS IF +.005.

The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara.  I just added the purchase deal on 
CGAS, it was not in Sitara.  Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover 
the ANR variable cost plus $.02.

"Re: CNG/Peoples Natural Gas","Donnie, for July, adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from 
Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT.  I 
may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables

For August, September, October, and November, make the Clinton volumes match

Paul, let me know if you have questions.  For July, the imbalance is actually 
in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.  For August forward, I 
believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes 
since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.  Let me know if you want to 
make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want these

Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I 
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.  
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of 
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So 
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria

Hey Jennifer and Dale,
I checked with Scott Neal and Dick Jenkins and they're on board with having 
all 4 trading locations available for our customers starting April on EOL (if 
possible with you guys of course).  The 2 existing locations are CNG SABINE 
NORTH POINT & CNG SABINE SOUTH POINT and the two new proposed locations will 
be CNG TRANSMISSION TTT SOUTH POOL & CNG TRANSMISSION TTT NORTH POOL.   There 
may be some confusion among our EOL customers with the similar names to these 
points so we have to be careful how we differentiate the names of the 4 
points.    The Enron trader responsible for the 2 new CNG Transmission 
locations will be Scott Hendrickson.  The business systems director at CNG  
Transmission who requested this of me is Iris King.  Her phone number is 
304-623-8213 and her e-mail is iris_g._king@cngt.cng.com.  She is also 
onboard with having the locations available to trade on EOL as soon as 
possible.

If I can provide any more info.to you, please let me know.   THANKS AGAIN IN 
ADVANCE!!!!!!

Hey Jennifer,  How are you?

We had a meeting with CNG Transmission today.  They have rolled out a new 
pooling service for their customers called CNG Transmission North pool and 
CNG Transmission South pool.  It's different than CNG South Point and CNG 
North Point.  These last two pertain to CNG Sabine Hub Services.  As they 
have presented these new services to their customers, all of their customers 
are inquiring as to whether or not EOL will be trading these two new 
locations in the future.  These new services on CNG Transmission have the 
benefit over CNG Sabine Hub Services pools of being free for the time being 
(until October at least)....How do we go about adding these two new trading 
locations on EOL.  Volumes can be transferred from CNG Sabine Hub Services 
points over to CNG Transmission pools at no cost and we are actually starting 
to set up our supplies and markets in this manner to save on pooling costs 
for April.   I have a contact that you can talk to at CNG Transmission if you 
would like.. Please let me know and thanks in advance!!!!

Paul is out of the office today but I found the customer name in my notes - 
it was right below all my notes on CanFibre.  The customer is Latrove Steel.  
I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works.  Does anyone object 
to that?  I will wait until this afternoon before I call.

Heidi
Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If 
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we 
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples  

Questions that I have:
1)  I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool.  It 
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the 
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these 
types of noms.)  This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas 
behind the gate and we don't need more production.  If the customer can't 
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will 
only make my pool longer.

2)  If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest 
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3)  Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount 
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?  

4)  If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be 
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with 
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples  

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction 
from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until 
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the 
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There 
are 7 Phillips meters  in CES's pool beginning July 2000.  Heidi Boyd @ CES 
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool 
until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in 
their pool beginning July 2000.

2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.  


Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the 
system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force 
Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd 
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
  Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will 
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

"Egan parking deal","For Dec, we were taking 4679 day from the Egan parking into TGT.  Effective 
12/16/2000, we moved the remaining balance to Jan 2001.  I made the following 
adjustments to deal 473190, 
 took daily withdrawal volumes to 0 effective 12/16 - 12/31
 extended the deal to Jan 2001
 changed 1/1/2001 to 2444
 changed 1/2/2001 - 1/31/2001 to 2414

This might be a little confusing because we also have withdrawals of about 
1500 day in Jan.

Also, Egan is showing a different balance than what I have.

I show we should have a total balance of 132,247 (4679 x (31-13)  plus  48025 
)  at the end of gas day 12/13/2000.  Egan is showing a balance of 134,302.  
This just means that we parked more gas than I thought or we cut back on some 
of our withdrawals on the 1st through the 13th.  No big deal, I just want to 
make sure we don't leave any gas in parking.

Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and 
replace with this purchase.

Stephanie,
Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please. 
Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he 
needs to get this pathed in the system.

Thanks all.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...


Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

"Re: PNG Local Production July 00","Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day 
from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.  

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 
for the month.  

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will 
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has 
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat 
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure 
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not 
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's 
brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas. 

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.  
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly 
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

Subject: PNG Local Production July 00


Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES

Subject: PSNC PROBLEM ON MARCH 1ST

Hi.  Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st.  I had requested 145 dth per day on
Doug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler.  For some reason Chris
Germany told PSNC to release capacity for 190 dth and not 145 dth.  PSNC 
called
me and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled.  I instructed PSNC to
contact Chris.  Per PSNC and my transco scheduler, I was to schedule 190 dth 
on
the first and then drop nom down to 145 effective the second.  I did this.
This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March
1st, that only 145 dth could be confirmed.  I called my transco scheduler and
she told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled.
(impossible as capacity was released to Enron).  All I wanted was 145 dth per
day for March.  Can someone please call Chris at Enron to confirm what should
and did get scheduled?  Thank you.

Chris, I just figured out why you did not see the e-mail, I did not send it 
to you!!!!
Sorry, here it is.
Guys,
A friend recommended Capacity Center, a service that e-mails information on 
capacity release, daily activity reports and system notices from pipelines on 
a daily basis.  There is a filtering mechanism for each service by pipeline, 
time frame and the critical nature of  the notices.  The cost is based on the 
number of users and reports, for example if we signed up 3 users for 6 months 
the cost would be approximately $3,000.  If you would like to check it out  I 
have negotiated a free trial for 2 weeks (until 11/5/00).  Click here 
http://www.capacitycenter.com/  the login name is sboyle@enron.com and 
password is jackd.  Let me know if you would like an overview or see any 
reports I can forward them to you via my e-mail.  Or you can call 
Carol Christopher

Thanks,
Sean

Subject: New and Exciting National Fuel Deal


We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons.

"CNG Appalachian production","Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have 
these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need 
to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;

   ""Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011"".

If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they 
send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM 
gathering and transmission contracts.  Unless someone objects I would like to 
get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and 
transmission contracts moved over.

Chris,

I just  got off the phone with Rich Contos, he wants me to find out if Enron
concurs with the storage volumes sold.  I think Ernie Simien or Doug Kinney 
had
sent some volumes and associated dollar amounts to you to look at.

Let me know if Enron is in concurrance.

Phone is 713-267-4646 and you can see the e-mail address.

Thanks,

The Donald

Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative 
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression 
into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a 
limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make 
this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a 
period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and 
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for 
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE 
compressor station.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405.   
Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental 
capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental 
capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the 
limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.  
Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it 
receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.  
Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing 
time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure 
that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other 
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression 
in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights 
to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more 
requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for 
which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed 
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should 
be included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after 
June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  
Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close 
after Noon on June 23, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value 
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on 
this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

"EnronOptions - Your Stock Option Program","---------------------- Forwarded by Chris Germany/HOU/ECT on 07/07/2000 01:42 
PM ---------------------------
 Office of the Chairman
From: Office of the Chairman@ENRON on 06/29/2000 11:46 AM
To: ESOP All Enron N. A.
cc:  
Subject: EnronOptions - Your Stock Option Program

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the 
first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recognize 
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron,s business goals, and we are 
pleased that many of you have shared in the company,s financial success 
through Enron stock options. 

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as the 
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided value 
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this 
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of 
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the 
program.   

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package 
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron,s continued 
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and 
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decided 
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for 
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option Program).  It is 
expected that EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, 
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligible 
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to 
final approval by Enron,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to 
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and 
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base 
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on 
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some 
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant 
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option 
Program, among other good reasons( that,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions ) 
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your questions, 
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host 
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular 
basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact your 
Human Resources representative. 

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron,s Board of Directors, granting 
of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal 
regulatory requirements.  It is expected that EnronOptions ) Your Stock 
Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enron 
companies, employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor 
or business issues.  As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the 
marketplaces we serve.  Given that need to change, we will continue to refine 
the eligibility for EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option Program and will 
communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being 
determined on December 29, 2000.

31st.

Scott--
Here is your problem in getting these booked.  You can do what you want, but 
I still think we should book it.  The flexibility in takes is only 10% so 
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't 
book anything.  Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell 
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to.  In addition, per our 
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely 
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or 
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year.  This 
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term.  And finally, what if 
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in 
there.

Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you 
want.

FYI,

I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are 
not reflected in the books.  Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to 
book since there is flexibility in the takes.  Also, he said he has a strong 
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it.  Dick 
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now.  So Chris 
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.

473178  Exchange sell for the November Injections
473190  Exchange buy for the December withdrawals.

Susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into Texas Gas.  

Tricia, deal 473190 has the daily withdrawal volumes.  Please set up the Egan

We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas 
and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I 
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.

Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR 
Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone 
know the deal tickets by the end of the day.

"CES billing for February","Hi gang.  You guys may or may not be interested in this.  The files 
""febsaleinv1.xls"" and ""febsaleinv2.xls"" are excel formats of ENA's invoice to 
CES for the month of Feb.  The ""2000ces02.xls"" file is where Goodell and I 
keep track of the CES transport demand charges and all the transport 
pricing.  There is also a tab in this file called CGAS.  I use the data in 
this tab to calculate the sale to CES on CGAS.  It is a completly manual 
process.

I believe it would be benificial for all of you to at least understand the 
pricing (excellent performance review stuff).  I do want to go over the data 
in the CGAS tab just to make sure I'm looking at the data correctly.

Thanks.

Jeff, I believe the manual billing items are in the ""febsaleinv2.xls"" file.  
I will be out for the rest of the afternoon.  I will try to touch base with

Brian, all of the support for the billing is in the ""2000ces02.xls"" worksheet.

Additional information on the Transco MarketLink shippers:

Shipper   Phase  Volume  Term  Delivery Pt  Rate

Aquila   I     25,000 Dthd 10 years Manhattan  $0.35
Consolidated Edison I     30,000  10  Manhattan  $0.35
ConEdison Energy I     10,000  10  Manhattan  $0.35
St. Lawrence Cement I       1,000  10  Camden, NJ  $0.30
Williams Energy I  100,000  10  Manhattan/PSEG $0.35
Virginia Power  II  100,000  10  Trenton-Woodbury $0.30
PPL Energy Plus II     30,000  10  Princeton Junction $0.18

 Phase 1 begins 11/1/01.  Phase II begins 11/1/02.  The rates shown are for 
the demand and are the rates that Transco had been marketing for the 
project.  Each shipper is responsible for fuel and the electric power 
commodity charge and ACA.  There will be no GRI or Great Plains commodity 
surcharges.  The Manhattan and PSEG delivery points are Transco Zone 6 NY 
points.  The Camden, Trenton-Woodbury and Princeton Junction points are 
non-NY.
 Williams reduced their precedent agreement volume from 210,000 Dthd to the 
100,000 Dthd.  Williams' rights to PSEG points are north of the Linden 
allocation point.  Virginia Power is buying a project from Statoil on the 
Trenton-Woodbury line.  Virginia Power's commitment to MarketLink replaces 
one of Statoil's two precedent agreements.  Statoil has also sold another 
project that was underlying their second precedent agreement.  The new and 
unnamed project owner has requested and been granted an extension to the 
90,000 Dthd precedent agreement for a later phase of MarketLink.  Sunset 
Energy Fleet has requested and been granted an extension for their 95,600 
Dthd precedent agreeement.  LFG, a landfill gas developer, has also been 
granted an extension of their 5,000 Dthd precedent agreement to enable LFG to 
finalize a sale with a new owner or to locate an alternative landfill site.  
PPL Energy Plus has the right to deliver into a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL Interstate Energy Company pipeline system in Lower Mt. Bethel 
Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania or a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL's Eden plant in East Drumore Township, Lancaster County, 
Pennsylvania on a primary basis.  They also have the right to extend their 
agreement at the $0.18 rate for an additional two five year terms.  Dynegy 
(30,000 Dthd) and Engage (210,000 Dthd) terminated their respective precedent 
agreements.  Due to these terminations and reductions,  Transco only has 
announced precedent agreements of 190,600 Dthd for later phases.  If these 
precedent agreements become contracts, MarketLink would have 486,600 Dthd of 
shipper volume.  Transco has stated that all 700,000 Dthd of MarketLink would 
be built by 11/01/04.

  Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue 
  and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. 
  Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, 
  Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. 
  You move like the bass which excite me in May. 
  You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. 
  Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. 
  Ye're as fragrant as ""snuff"" right out of the can. 
  You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; 
  I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. 
  On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, 
  well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. 
  Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, 
  What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. 
  Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, 
  To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. 
  Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. 
  Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. 
  Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, 
  You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. 
  When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, 
  My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. 
  Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. 
  Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'. 

  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, 
  We two go together like a skunk goes with stank. 

  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; 
  They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way. 

  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, 
  From the cooler at Kroger. ""That's impressive,"" I say. 

  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. 
  ""Diamonds is ferever,"" they explains, suave and couth. 

  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. 
  Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you. 

  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, 
  More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor!

                                                      May 9, 2000 9:40 a.m.

 Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into 
our
gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited 
number 
of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity 
somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: 
For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering 
and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig, 
Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" 
affected 
are 3219, 3223 and 3224 for the Schultz area and 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217, 
3218, 
3220, 3221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208, 3209, 3210, 3211, 3212 and 
3213
for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there 
does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor 
stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression 
agreements
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the 
existing
compressors.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the 
applications 
it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominion 
recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time 
frames.
We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the 
application 
process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once 
granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within 
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity
will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for
incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will 
award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the 
incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be

                                                Posted May 9, 2000 9:07 a.m.



 Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and 
through innovative projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with 
that process to bring you more value for your local production and to 
improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a
process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.  
We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, 
and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to 
the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  
For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, 
the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept
applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas 
feeding the Barbour County High Pressure System.  The Dominion ""bubble""
affected is 4205.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does
exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor 
stations.
The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements 
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the 
pipeline system.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the 
applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not 
unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed 
gas entering the system.  Please submit your written application to 
Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  
The application must indicate the amount of ""incremental"" gas for the 
specific compression agreement.  Dominion recognizes that the installation 
of compression requires differing time frames.  We will balance that 
consideration with our need to insure that the application process is 
not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, 
the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within 
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed 
capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression 
rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, 
Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression. 
Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under 
the compression agreement.  Your name, company name and address, 
state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address,
if available, should be included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
                                Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 12, 
2000
to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  Please realize that
this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 12, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this 
opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 
623-8709
or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding 
this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

Subject: CGLF

Deal # 454471 and Deal # 418249 are both set up for contract 69357. Deal # 
418249 matches the invoice so I think Deal # 454471 needs to be killed.  

The rate and volumes on Deal # 454471 match the invoice for contract 69759 
but Deal # 460384 is set for this contract.

Bottom line - we have an extra deal (454471) in the system according to how 
we were invoiced.

If you agree, please have Elizabeth kill the deal .

thanks,
Brenda

Paul,

An Amendment to Appendix ""C"" will need to completed by both the pool that the
meters are being transferred from and the pool that the meters are being
transferred to.  I have discussed this issue with Heidi Boyd at Columbia 
Energy
and I believe she will complete this form on their behalf in order to delete 
the
meters.  You will also need to complete this form in order to add the meters 
to
Clinton's LGA pool once the Pooling Agreement has been completed and the pool
becomes effective.  I will fax the form to Heidi this morning.  It must also 
be
signed by the producer.  Please confirm your fax number (614-760-2794) and I
will be happy to fax the form to you as well.

Hi Carol,

Can you help me with the below information?  I am looking to turn over our
local production.  After August we won't be in business anymore and this local
production that is in our name is really Enron North America's local
production.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local agg
pool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can 
turn
this production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to give
them formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identification
numbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).

I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get this
cleared up and seem to have no luck.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi Karen,

Please nominate a volume of 24,800 dth's for the month of July 00 for CES'
local production.

Please let me know if you need something more from me.  I understand that
Clinton Energy is setting up a pool and will soon be able to take over our
local production.  I will be sending in a letter soon relinquishing the local
production, is there a meter number or identification number that I will need
to mention in the letter?

Thanks,

to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several 
pipelines.  Who should I talk to?

On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and 
sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection 
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal 
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what 
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how 
to do it.

Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?

I spoke with Rich yesterday.  He said it would be OK to net the storage true 
up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.  I mailed the invoice via 
interoffice to Jeff.

There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably 
be billed to New Power.  All of the deals in question are on the Central desk.

How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?  Rich said it was his 
understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal.

"Hey are you still breathing?","From the Birmingham Sunday Mercury (7th Jan 2001)
  Worker dead at desk for 5 days

  Bosses of a publishing  firm are trying to work out why no one
  noticed that one of their employees had been sitting dead at
  his desk for FIVE DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling
  okay.  George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a
  proof-reader at a New York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack
  in the open-plan office he shared with 23 other workers.  He
  quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody noticed until
  Saturday morning when an office cleaner  asked why he was
  still working during the weekend.  His boss Elliot Wachiaski
  said ""George was always the first guy in each morning and the
  last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that he was in
  the same position all that time and didn't say anything.  He was
  always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself.  ""A post
  mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five
  days after suffering a coronary.  Ironically, George was
  proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.

  You may want to give your co-workers a nudge or kick
  occasionally.

"Re: Meeting","The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.  Experience has taught me that 
someone much more important may bump us.

This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.  What we bill CES for 
storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.  April is 
a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the 
same time.  CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.  The 
deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the 
withdrawals.

Which brings up the following issues;
 *   How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES 
at the storage facility.
  Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for 
storage.  How did that work?  Mark, I'm counting on you for this one.

 * How do we track the storage balance in Unify?

 * How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will 
bill on the net injections/withdrawals

I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting.

Thanks

"EOG for July, Peoples","ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio 
(10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take 
this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would 
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from 
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks 
like this pool can be terminated.

Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi 
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was 
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may 
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in 
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer 
any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this 
after the 4th.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type.  Our Unify 
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting 
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like 
we did Southern Natural.  And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in 
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type 
manner.  We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production 
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the 
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't 
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the 
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream 
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify.  The pipe told me this is 
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area.  If it is 
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter 
the data twice today.  If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's 
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

==============================================================================
=======================
Email excerpt between Diane (in magenta) and Chris Zachary in IT Dptmt at 
National Fuel Gas Supply Corp (in blue) ===>

>> 3) Please confirm that your model type is always ""P"" pathed from noms all 
the
>> way down to invoices.

    Our model type is always ""P"" for pathed.

I saw that mortgage rates rose today.  Did you really lose that much

You are a good gradson.  I got a quilt out of Dad's closet and took to Ma
Monday night.  I was only there for 15 min and I bet she asked me 5 times
if I had a girlfriend.  By the 5th time I think I was telling her I was
married with 6 kids.  She only metioned you taking her for a ride 20 times.

I seemed to have gotten in on the wrong side of NYMX today.  I got short
around a $5.24 and the offer is now $5.395.  Let's see - I've only lost
$185,000.00 today.  Oh well, its just money I guess.  Its funny how unhappy

Subject: Local Production for June

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

and East in the same month?  If so, this would mean 2 different Global Nos.
and that would create a problem downstream.  Please advise.

Subject: Capacity Deal tickets

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up 
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, 
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.  
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes 
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same 
contract under both desk.

Subject: FW: Transco Files Motion For Modification of Settlement




Just wanted to make sure all of you saw this notice that we posted on the 
bulletin board last week.? This may mean significant $$$ for some of you.? In 
brief, we are filing a request to make an early partial refund.? The refund 
is related to the rate of return settlement in our last rate filing.? 
According to the rate case proceedings, the refund is not due until a final 
non-appealable order is issued, but we are requesting permission to do a 
partial refund sooner (around Oct 31).? As the bulletin states, if your 
company wishes to wait to receive its full refund after the final, 
non-appealable order, please notify me or another Transco rep.

Happy Halloween.?? ii

Subject:??????? Transco Files Motion For Modification of Settlement 

September 22, 2000 

To:? Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and 
Shippers 

Re: Transco Files a Motion for Modification of Settlement to 
??? Permit Interim Partial Refunds 
??? Docket Nos. RP97-71-000 and RP97-312-000 

In response to certain customers' requests, Transco submits a 
Motion for Modification of Settlement to Permit Interim Partial 
Refunds in the above-captioned proceedings. By this motion, 
Transco requests that the Commission modify Article V of the 
January 20, 1998 Stipulation and Agreement to permit Transco to 
make an interim partial refund of amount to Non-Contesting 
Parties, if any, related to the Capital Structure/Rate of Return 
Issues on or about October 31, 2000. The refund is being made to 
parties in advance of the date that such refunds are due as set 
forth in the Stipulation and Agreement, in part to help mitigate 
the effects of current high natural gas prices on their 
customers. For further detailed information of the Motion filed 
at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, please refer to 
Transco's filing today in the above mentioned dockets. 

Specifically, Transco proposes to make interim partial refunds on 
or about October 31,2000 to Non-Contesting Parties related to the 
Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues. Transco will refund to 
those customers with interest from the date of payment to the 
date of refund, the amount, if any, collected from May 1, 1997 
through February 29,2000 in excess of the amount that would have 
been collected under the Settlement Rates as adjusted by the 
Commission's findings in its March 17, 2000 order in Docket No. 
RP97-71-000 on the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues, 
subject to the ""refund floor"". These interim partial refunds will 
be made on a lump sum basis, and will not be accompanied by any 
supporting documentation. However, supporting documentation for 
the principal and the interest calculation will be available upon 
request. 

If a Non-Contesting Party does not wish to receive an interim 
partial refund, and wishes instead to await issuance of a final 
Commission order no longer subject to rehearing on the Capital 
Structure/Rate of Return issues prior to receiving any refunds 
related to those issues, Transco requests that such Non- 
Contesting Party notify its customer service representative, on 
or before October 25, 2000, of its election not to participate in 
the interim partial refunds.

"TCO Storage","Use the ""Daily Activity"" worksheet in this file.  The CES storage balance as 
of 7/31/2000 is 4,053,932 dth (see balance in cell L146).  The actual sale to 
CES for the storage injections is deal 268094 - this deal shows the daily and 
monthly activity.

If I remember correctly, the only confusion we had on the TCO storage was the 
beginning balance.  There was 170,981 dth in storage on March 31st.  To 
correct for this, we adjusted the injections for April so that the balance on 
April 30th was 13%.

Let me know if you have questions.

Subject: CES Retail capacity

Per our discussion on Monday, we need to give CES-Retail a bid for the two 
TCO transportation contracts that were dedicated to c&i customers that they 
will no longer need once they sell their c&i business effective 6/1/00.  As 
you recall, one contract is to COH for 20,000/d through 10/31/00 (#65402); 
the other is to BG&E  for 19,000/d through 4/01(#65403).  This is the 
information that Jeff Porter and Charlie gave to me--you need to confirm that 
this information is accurate.

I am going to call Charlie back tomorrow morning (Friday, 5/12) and suggest 
that he talk to one of you two directly for a bid on the agreements.  I think 
this will be more efficient (and put the pressure on you to price it 
up!!).    If there is any problem with this, please let me know.

Notice to all Appalachian Pool Operators:           Received 3/29/00  2:00 pm
Reclassification Notice                            Posted 3/29/00  2:00 pm

On February 10, 1999, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549, granting CNG 
Transmission's (CNGT's) request for reclassification of various transmission 
lines to gathering lines.  As part of that Docket, several transmission lines 
were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to 
further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.   
On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting 
reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines.  
The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, 
H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, 
CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective 
April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff 
sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff 
sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel 
retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have 
questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at 
(304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.

April 3, 2000                                                Received 4/3/00

11:10 am

Dear Pool Operator:

 CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings 
Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance 
starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires 
that the ""wet gas"" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.  
The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no 
unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations 
are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions 
concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed 
to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.

 Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets 
other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. 
on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations 
to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight 
and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per 
CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT 
considering 
the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your 
pool.

 As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult 
to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your 
pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's 
local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators 
notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify 
producers individually.

 We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted 
to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us 
to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled 
shut       down will not be until 2002.

 If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to 
contact me at (304) 623-8698. 

      Sincerely,



      Nancy M. Aucremanne
      Manager, Producer Services
      And Business Agreements

visiting me next weekend... girls night out. The following weekend Cindy is
visiting me. The weekend after that I'll be in Houston for TCO shipper
meeting. It has been two weeks since I've seen him. We have a great time
when we are together, it just hasn't been very often latetly.

I'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach.  I'm sure she
will agree after I tell her what to see.  I guess women can be sensitive.

Ingrid's fine - and you?  How's your man?

My last response didn't make sense... now that I re-read it. I meant to see
I like a cat personality better.

I'm sorry about the cushy remark... I'm guessing you have worked out a
lot... since I last saw you. It's probably rock hard now.

So how is ingrid??

I planted 50 plus flowers this weekend in my flower boxes. They look so
pretty. I hope I don't kill them. I'm going to find me some kittens in the
next few weeks. I'm lonely without Miss Muffy. Cindy Vachuska is coming to
visit me in two weekends. I'm taking May 4th off.. we are going to do some
museums, day to the eastern shore, and baltimore's inner harbor.

Bidweek is such a joy!!! We are suppose to be back online with y'all... so
they say.

"CGAS Storage","The CGAS exchange deals I set up for CGAS storage end Oct 31st.  I'm thinking 
of changing the process effective 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  ENA billed CES (now

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on 
vacation.

I believe we need 2 pricing zones, Mainline Pool and Offshore.  The new Sea

following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone;

I think the best thing to do would be to create a separate zone for all of 
those ISRP meters.  The traders typically take deals from ISRP to the Pool 
and incur transport.  Therefore having two zone would more accurately 
represent what is actually happening.

I am in London helping Brent Price with some audit work that he is doing.

Subject: Re: Sea Robin Well Head Curve

Well, whenever we map specific meters on a zone to curves that are different 
than what the entire zone is mapped to, we create an alternative facility 
mapping for each specific meter that you want mapped differently.  Currently, 
there are 137 active meters on the Sea Robin Pool zone with a prefix of 
ISRP.  That would mean I would have to create 137 alternative facility 
mappings.  Another alternative would be to have all of those meters moved to 
their own zone and then just create one mapping for that whole zone.  
However, this will also take a great deal of time, since Global Facilities 
would have to change the zone on every single facility record.  Plus, we 
would have to see what type of activity is on all of these meters and we 
would have to update the zone on all of these deals after Global Facilities 
made it's change.  So, let me know what your thoughts are.  What are you 
doing in London???

Imelda,

I am in London right now, and dont' have access to a phone.  The only part of 
Sea robin that should be moved are the meters with a prefix of ISRP.  I'm 
sorry if that wasn't clear.  Please let me know if that will be a problem to 
fix.

David, Sea Robin Pool is a zone on the Sea Robin Pipeline (SEAR).  The Sea 
Robin Pool zone includes many different meters some of which do have a prefix 
of ISRP.  However, there are also other meters in that zone that have the 
following prefixes: LSRP, FSRP and PSRP.  I mapped the entire zone to the new 
curves you sent us.  Given your message it seems like things might not be 
peachy after all if you only wanted the ISRP meters mapped that way.  Please 
call me as soon as you get a chance.

I am not sure if Searobin ISRP is a meter level location or Zone level, but 
as long as only Sea Robin Pool ISRP locations are mapped to the new curve, 
then everything will be peachy.

Angel,

Steve Gillespie is managing the day to day operations of the VNG asset mgt. 
deal for our logistics group.  Please include him with your queries.  It is 
my understanding that we are agents for all of their contracts and we pay all 
their transport costs.  In turn, we invoice them and they re-imburse us for 
that transport. 

Chris Germany and Scott Goodell in the Transportation Trading Group  are 
responsible for setting these contracts in UNIFY.  All of these contracts in 
question are storage or transportation tied to storage. Chris/Scott please 
set up the 5 valid contracts below in UNIFY as soon as possible....Contract 
37634 is terminated effective 8/31/1999.

If you have any questions please let us know.
Victor

Subject: Virginia Natural Gas...Columbia Gas

Hi Joann and Alvin,

As you know, effective October 1, ENA became agent for Virginia Natural Gas.  
Here in Volume Management, as I try to load beginning balances and actualize 
volumes (so that I can pay VNG's transportation charges) for 10/2000, it 
appears that the following contracts for VNG/Cgas are not in Unify.

Contract Number  Type    
38079    FSS...Master Contract
35889    x-133 LNG Storage
60536    SST
37634    ISS
53004    FSS
60537    FSS

I would appreciate any help you can give me in getting these contracts in 
Unify as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or need additional 
information, please let me know.

Thanks,
Angel

try my sheet again, it is adjusted to pool and the 1st is still good. Since 
COH is the only TCO market with any swing, I am sticking with those to 
calculate. We look 5,000 off on 2 & 3. 
I have 41,858(FOM)+15,000 (NP Buy)-53,798(TCO usage)=(3,060) sell to NPC.
These were TCO totals but my COH numbers on 2 & 3 match, adjusted for F% to 
pool.

"Transco capacity issue","With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more 
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we 
are buying.  Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the 
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.  I would 
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the 
delivery points.

I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the 
month.  Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt 
and delivery point on the contract.  But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it 
and I am unable to verify the information myself.  It could have a big impact 
on what we flow in Z6.

Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?  Let 
me know if you need specific capacity examples.

Subject: Re: Questions  

Responses:
1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.

2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would 
like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes 
through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas 
on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we 
are buying back gas at GD - $.01.

3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill 
CES directly for this?  

4.  See attached worksheets.

5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The 
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing 
using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.  
Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she 
will recreate Jan - Mar.

6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about 
the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about 
total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take 
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and 
you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as 
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a 
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something 
specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take 
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has 
discussed this with Melissa.

<mflewellyn@columbiaenergygroup.com> 
Subject: Questions


Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.

1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
the
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
plus
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.

2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes 
for
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required 
to
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
with
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.

3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since 
the
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous ""buy/sell""  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.

4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please 
provide
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
basis
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)

5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?

6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?


There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they
arise.

Thanks.

The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES

Elizabeth...  Can you tell us if the terms of the Formosa Plastics/Sport 
Pipeline deals have changed?  The terms USED to be Formosa got the first 
15,000/day (deal 229875), Sport deal #244626 got the next 5,000/day and Sport 
deal #244627 took the swing.  There have been new deals set up in Sitara for 
November production that don't mirror that.  Formosa deal #463959 starts on 
day 4 (what happened to days 1-3?) and gets the first 15,000/day.  Sport deal 
# 456694 covers days 1-3 but the prices are tiered to include what looks like 
Formosa's volume.  Sport deal #463958 covers the rest of the month but the 
prices don't mirror the first 3 day's prices.  Do you see a problem here??!!

Help!!

"Re: Columbia Gas of Ohio on CGAS for Jan 00","Brian, we have  a deal we can't identify.  Do you show anything in your 
records about purchasing 3,575 dt's on Jan 20th or 21st?  It looks like a 1 
day deal and we bought the gas delivered from CGAS of Ohio.  The delivery 
point in our system is 23N but that may be wrong.  The price would be 
somewhere around $16.00.

Chris,

Do you know if all this gas was simply turned around and sold to CES?  And do 
you know if we have made any progress on getting these deals into the system?

Attached is the backup fro the Jan, Feb and Mar for Belden & Blake's NYSEG 
invoices.  I created these spreadsheets from the information given me by 
Heidi Boyd, who was the person nominating this gas for CES.  Belden & Blake 
invoiced ENA base on these spreadsheets.
 The NYSEG gas is a back to back purchase/sale to CES.  There should be a 
deal for the sale in the system for the sale.  Check with Chris Germany.
There are three price scenarios for the gas.  Should there be a spereate  
deal for each price? 
John

Subject: St. Mary's VPP - Texas Gas Operational Flow Order [OFO]


St. Mary's gas flows on Texas Gas [TGT].  

On January 26th, TGT issued a Critical Notice, that in essence states that 
they will not accept a nom to flow gas if it doesn't meet certain pipeline 
spec criteria - they will not accept gas over 1050 Btu content.  St. Mary's 
gas is around 1085 Btu.  Thus, this gas will have to be processed at the 
downstream Eunice Plant, or it will be shut in, starting either Monday the 
26th, or March 1st - this is uncertain right now.  I am working with Charlie 
Otto [Fred's group] and Jay Hartman/Brad Strong to put a processing contract 
together.  Charlie has/or is working on a processing contract with Hunt 
[operator] and this contract will be pretty much the same as Hunt's 
processing contract.  Since gas HAS TO be processed in order to flow, there 
is not much negotiating that will be done.

Since the price of gas is high [and producers do not want to process] , in 
the last couple months, there have been several pipelines to issue OFO's re 
Btu content.  This is the first time that I know of that this has ever been 
such an issue.

Terms of the processing contract:  $0.10 fee, shrink/PVR will be about 12%, 
producer keeps 100% of the NGL's.  Per Charlie, he thinks that this 12% 
shrink/100% liquids equates to a $0.05 or $0.06 loss.  Thus, the cost of 
processing is expected to be around $0.15 to $0.16.  The processing contract 
will be month to month and used only when it is mandatory under the OFO.

St. Mary's will be responsible for all fees, and shrink.  As an example, if 
100 is flowing at the wellhead, and 60 is VPP.  then, there will be 60 as 
VPP, 12 as PVR/PTR [shrink], and 28 as excess gas.  

St. Mary's would like the processing contract in ENA's name, since ENA should 
have title to the gas as it goes thru Eunice, and would just reimburse ENA 
for the 10 cent fee, or any other actual applicable fees.  Teresa - can you 
put something together re this reimbursement.  Charlie sees no problem in 
putting this in ENA's name, if someone sees an issue with this, please let me 
know ASAP.

George, Melissa, Lia - we will need to start nom'ing PVR/PTR.

Chris Germany - do we need a PTR contract on TGT?

Teresa - per the Production & Delivery Agrmt, it states that St. Mary's 
cannot process their gas.  We will need a waiver to this section 4, for the 
time period that processing is mandatory.  

Lia, George, John - the OFO notice came out on January 26, and I heard about 
this via Charlie today, is there some way in the future we can be notified 
more quickly about possible issues re the flow of any of our VPP gas?

Charlie will get his first draft of the contract on Friday and will work with 
myself and Jay/Brad to get this put together on Friday, in case this OFO does 
go into effect on Monday.

Anyone with any questions or concerns, please contact me immediately.

TMR earnings report tomorrow...

I've been watching this sector -  ie small cap oil&gas.
Most companies have risen prior to earnings, but then have a pretty good 
sell-off
after announcing record earnings.

Examples: 
 CHK earnings report on 2/20 stock price=$10.80, by 2/24 stock price = $9.10.
 GW earnings report on 2/12 price = $6.70, by 3/1 price $5.05.
 OEI earnings 1/25 price $18.05, then 1/30 $16.75 but today $19.00
 DNR earnings 2/23 price + $11.00 by 3/1 $9.70
 CRK earnings 2/14 price = $13.80 by 2/20 $10.20
 
So...buy the rumor, sell the fact ????
I still want to hold TMR long term, but maybe take a little profit tomorrow 
?????????

Subject: 1st annual House Party

Well, now that I am somewhat settled into my new home (I'm still trying to 
hunt down a giant slip-n-slide for the backyard), it's time to throw a 
party.  This Saturday, April 15th at 7:30 pm, I will have my first official 
party to put the first beer stains on the new home.  Let's keep this pretty 
simple and painless, everybody just needs to bring a little something to 
drink and I will provide the rest.  I will have directions sitting on my desk 
to figure out how to get to Pearland, for all you inside the loop people 
don't be afraid, it's not that difficult and long of a drive.  

If you have any questions let me know and please pass this on to anybody I 
may have left off the list.


Hope to see you all Saturday,

Matt


Directions:

Take 288 S to the Pearland exit (CR 518) and take a left off the exit (going 
east).  You will stay on 518 for 1.2 miles.  After you come upon your third 
stop light you will make a right, this will be CR 90 ( there will be a strip 
mall on your right with a Domino's Pizza on the corner).  Travel on 90 for 
1.8 miles until you dead end.  This will take you to CR 101, which you will 
take a left on.  Stay on CR 101 for 0.4 miles until you see Kennedy Rd and 
take a left.  My house is the first house on your left-hand side once you 
turn onto Kennedy.  3606 Kennedy Drive   281-692-9255

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.  
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes

Demand charges are showing up now.  We still have a problem with the 9th 
(4500 @ $5.445), this should not be on the invoice.  My Transco scheduler has

part works.

discuss what needs to come across in the proprietary file.  Transco was 
making some changes on their side for the BUG stuff that we may not be taking

Subject: TRANSCO PROPRIETARY FILE

Dave,

As we discussed over the telephone, we will have a problem with the CES 
contracts as well
as the one we have with Brooklyn Union.  Our proprietary file contacts the 
business party id, rather
than the DUNS number.  Currently, all of our activities default to Enron's 
business party id.  These
are the valid business parties we use:

ENA    5304
Brooklyn Union   21995 
Columbia Energy Services 5092
Columbia Energy Marketing 7772

As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various 
producers, we will
need to include their business parties as well.  For now, this is all we 
need.  In the meantime,
should I code the activities CES has already nominated that I will insert 
into Unify as do not
send??

Also, another continuing problem is the 899 default ranking.  We spend a 
great deal of time 
overriding this rank to 850 as a default and use 899 as the swing activity to 
be cut as we need
it.  Is there a way to default to 850 so we only have to change the one swing 
activity to 899??

Thanks for you help.

Beverly

Hi Chris, 

I just called you a while ago and they said you'd call me back.? I may not be

I called to thank you for the goody package I received this afternoon.? 
Hector likes his golf shirt and my pen and pencil are very nice.? I've 
already tested them both.

I'm going to be visiting the New York customers this week and I'll probably 
take my new pen and pencil with me, if I can figure out a way to cover up the 
Enron part.

Hope you are well.? Let's talk soon so we can act like tomatoes and catchup.?

Hey gang.  Attached is the maualy invoice for Oglethorpe.  I have fixed the

invoice.  Can we adjust the expected volumes in Sitara to match the manual 
invoice?  If yes, how do you balance Unify since these are deal volumes and 
not actual flow volumes.

AND Sherri, how this be entered from the accounting side in Unify, since 
scheduling vs actual flow vs billing are all different?

Chris--I discovered that the previous final March file that I sent you
contained a duplicate listing for NJN.  I have corrected it in this version.

Subject: Re: CES/Aristech deal  

This deal is starting to get confusing.... so here is the whole deal 
effective 3/21 to 3/31.

  gulf / leach/coh 22-3

38011/46 8979/8711/8527
51875/25 3657/3548/3473
60599/7  3159/3065/3000
63895/6  3686/3576/3500
63895/8  0/1917/1876  This piece from TCO pool.

No contracts are currently overrun.

Cindy/Kathy/Jesse - we are pulling 19481 from your p20 pool on contract 
63895, which max's out the contract. Any additional Aristech coh 22-3 sale 
will  have to be from TCO pool.

Kara - we are delivering to coh 22-3 as follows:
38011 = 8527
51875 = 3473
60599 = 3000
63895 = 5376

John - I have 550,154 being pulled from p20 for the month. I hope that ties 
to your number. I cannot pull any additional gas from p20, because this would 
overrun your FTS1 contract. The 1 dkt SIT can be made up from Enron's TCO 
pool. Please verify that this is okay. I'll schedule it for 3/23 gas day.

Thank you everyone for your patience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: CES/Aristech deal

I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas (deal 221731) effective 21st-31st.  
Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.  I changed 
the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool 
(deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt.

 2727 - 751 = 1976 at mainline.  
1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool.

Price = $2.77
 .1045  variable cost mainline to Leach
 .0250  demand charge 
 ---------
 2.8995 CGAS price.



Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN

Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience 
at Enron and what we can do to help make it better.  That's why we want to 
check your pulse.  In fact, we've changed the name of last year's ""Excellence 
Through Communication"" employee survey to The Pulse.  We believe The Pulse 
more accurately captures the purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis will help 
us correct problem areas so we can continue to make Enron a great place to 
work.

Is available:  Monday, October 16 ) Friday, Oct. 27
Is located at: survey.enron.com

There are a few things we want you to remember about The Pulse:

1. Your survey responses will be confidential.  You can complete your survey 
at your desktop or at special computer kiosks that are set up in some of our 
larger offices.  Several group computer terminals also will be available in 
smaller field offices.  We want to provide you with the most comfortable 
environment possible, as your participation is of vital importance to us.
2. We will respond actively to your comments.  We are going to do our best to 
cure some of the current problems that exist and put into action preventative 
processes that will help identify smaller problems before they become major 
ones.  We may ask for your help in resolving some of the issues that are 
collected in the survey ) your active role will help us identify the best 
solutions.
In last year's survey, you identified several problem areas regarding 
internal communications and we've already acted on many of your 
recommendations.  These are a few of the things we've accomplished or are 
working on in direct response to your input:
1. Require all executives (VP and above) to attend the Executive Impact & 
Influence course, which is a 360-degree program designed to improve 
leadership and communication skills.  By year-end, more than 90 percent will 
have attended this course, with the remaining 10 percent to be trained in the 
first quarter of 2001.
2. Offer all employees online communication courses.  These courses will be 
available in the first quarter of 2001.
3. Improve our online communication tools, beginning in the fourth quarter, 
2000:
   w Simplify and standardize Enron directories
   w Educate all employees about the availability and usage of IT tools.
   w Promote intelligent/responsible use of email.
4. Introduce Participation & Dissent (P&D) sessions to provide a vehicle for 
solving problems, addressing issues and developing new opportunities.  This 
application will launch in the first quarter of 2001 in the ThinkBank on 
eThink.

So take a few minutes to check your pulse and tell us what you think and how 
you feel about your job and about Enron.

Subject: Re: Allegany contract on CGAS  

A Service Verification is a statement created in the Settlements module of 
Unify.  The Volume Management group uses this statement to approve a payment 
to a pipeline for a transportation related expense.  The Service Verification 
shows an amount calculated on quantities for a contract in Path Manager, 
times a rate from  either the Unify Tables or a rate on the Sitara deal 
ticket.  I could put a zero rate on the Sitara deal ticket to zero the 
unnecessary expense out but this doesn't resolve the issue.  Since we are 
noming agent only, we don't want something coming across the system for 
calculation of a payment.  Is there a different way to handle these types of 
contracts when they are being entered in Path Manager?  I've heard of 
something like a point nom as way to handle.  Are we doing that on this 
contract?

I was running down a hill during my hanggliding class, lost my balance, 
stepped in a hole and dislocated my ankle.  Jerry was taking the class with 
me.  He was laughing really hard until he saw my foot..  If I was sitting in 
a chair holding my leg straight out and facing North, the bottom of my foot 
was facing North East.

I got to ride in an ambulance to the hospital.  I didn't hear this but the 
Dr. told them to take me to ""a very quiet room"".   He popped my foot back in 
place and sent me to x-ray.  I don't have any broken bones but the ligaments 
are probably all torn up.  I go to an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow.  Right 
now, I have an ace bandage wrapped around a fiberglass support.

I think you should buy one of those 4 door short bed Nissan Pickup Trucks.

What are you looking for in a truck?

Since we have meters (Phillips Production meters) in the pool, if PNG will 
allow, it may be best to transfer the pool to ENA's name.  If the CES pool 
has to be closed, Phillips Production will have to sign documents to move 
meters from pool to pool.  I'm not sure what the lead time is to move meters.


If you are going to nom 430 Dth/Day, Heidi needs to nom Phillips Production @ 
9,058 Mcf/Month (9,058 * 1.03 = 9,330 dth) plus Power Gas 4,000 Dth/month.

Is Clinton going to take the PNG throug the end of the contracts?  Power Gas 
expires 10/31, Phillips expires 11/30.

Subject: EOG for July, Peoples

ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio 
(10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take 
this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would 
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from 
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks 
like this pool can be terminated.

Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi 
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was 
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may 
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in 
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer 
any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this 
after the 4th.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If 
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we 
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples  

Questions that I have:
1)  I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool.  It 
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the 
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these 
types of noms.)  This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas 
behind the gate and we don't need more production.  If the customer can't 
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will 
only make my pool longer.

2)  If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest 
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3)  Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount 
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?  

4)  If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be 
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with 
PNG.

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction 
from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until 
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the 
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There 
are 7 Phillips meters  in CES's pool beginning July 2000.  Heidi Boyd @ CES 
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool 
until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in 
their pool beginning July 2000.

2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.  


Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the 
system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force 
Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd 
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
  Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will 
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

going up there this coming weekend.  You should have bought a boat during
the boat show.  I have a friend who is always fishing and I will ask him
about a boat.  Do you want a ski boat or a fishing boat?  Freshwater or
Saltwater.  I do know the best motors are made by Yamaha.  A friend of mine
at Demi Jon had a Gulf Coast which is basically a chopped down Boston
Whaler.  I think the boat was around 21/23 '.  The sides were approximately
6/8"" tall with a center console and a very large ice chest mounted directly
behind that which served as a seat.  It also had what I call a jack plate on
the motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom.  He
could run in about 8"" of h2o.  If I remember correctly it was a V 6 150
horse Yamaha.  That baby would fly.  They are bay boats but Aubrey took his
out in the Gulf frequently.  You should call Duane Davis.  I bet he can find
you exactly what you want.

Chris--There is a recurring set of monthly transactions on ENA's invoices that
I don't recognize.  Perhaps you can help me understand what they are.   In 
each
case, CES is invoiced for purchasing approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Dth/month at
TCO pool at an IF TCO Appl index price.   The Sitara # for this transaction is
SA-226553.  Then, this same monthly volume is re-purchased by ENA at a fixed
price.  The Sitara # for the ""buy-back"" is SA-227738.

Do these transactions have something to do with the physical gas that we have
purchased from ENA for our retail customer retention activities?

Thanks.

estimating a good retail volume to book.

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term 
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible.  For your information, 
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and 
prices in it.  I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10% 
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to 
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided 
to us by CES.  

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he 
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of 
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway, 
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in 
by your group (I think you're the right one).  Again, those deals should be 
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.  In addition, I 
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, 
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to 
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things 
are matching up.  I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please 
advise.

Chris, lets meet next Tuesday at 2:00 p.m. (Conference Room EB-3745) to 
discuss the status of the January 2000 invoice billing (sales & purchase). 
There is still a substantial amount that is not showing up  in Unify. 
Customer is paying Enron $28 million on Monday and we only have $11 million 
in the system that is showing up. We sent Columbia a manual invoice for 
$16,972,671.72 and a system generated invoice of $11,477,340.49 on Friday 
February 18th.

Send me an e-mail back to confirm.

Thanks, Jeff

have the deal priced at $2.14.  Could you please check with the trader and

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade 
behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go 
away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 
2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
 Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

Attached is the latest file on capacity.  I have updated the C&I list for
releases from O&R on Columbia Gulf and TCO, from BUG on TETCO and from LILCO 
on
Transco.  I have updated the Choice list for releases from Atlanta on CNG,
Sonat, South Georgia and Transco.   On the Wholesale list, I have reflected 
the
releases that we have made on Columbia Gulf, TCO and TETCO from capacity
associated with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and for the release from
South Jersey on Transco.  All of these changes are highlighted in blue.  The
following releases have not yet taken place for 1/2000, but should happen on
Monday or Tuesday:

C&I

CNG - Release from Hope for sale to Bayer
CNG - NiMo customers
TCO - Release from Eagle Point for sale to COH customers
TETCO - Dayton Power & Light customers
Texas Gas - Dayton Power & Light customers
Transco - PSNC customers
Trunkline - Dayton Power & Light customers


Choice

East Tennessee - Atlanta customers
Midwestern - NIPSCO customers
NGPL - NIPSCO customers
Tennessee - Atlanta customers

If you have any questions, please call Scott Goodell or myself.

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 markets until Monday, 12/27.  We will need a
range from 2800 dth to 3600 dth per day.   This large swing is normal for 
these
types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Subject: Equitabel Gas Company Exchange on Tetco

CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas 
Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is 
giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new 
best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the 
January transaction is complete.

Here are my questions/comments;

1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 
146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange.  
I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC.  
If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the 
new deal.  Please let me know ASAP.

2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to 
see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment 
was due.

3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it 
above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?

4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES 
deals.  He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America.  Who 
should he talk to about that??


Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.

Thanks

we will know that on Thursday.   The number on the attached spreadsheet is our

The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen 
contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party 
gives 90 day written notice to end the contract.  

I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one of 
you is it?

I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.  Susan, you can toss this.

Subject: CES Daily for Aug'00 Requirements for 8/1/00 and after


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 8/1and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Chesapeake Energy stock being sorely undervalued 
2001-02-25
By Melissa Davis
Business Writer

Ask the experts. Chesapeake Energy is more than a $9 stock. 
Forget that Chesapeake is up more than 200 percent from a year ago -- and up 
more than 1,000 percent from its lowest days, not long ago, when it traded 
for less than $1. Chesapeake still appears sorely undervalued. 
Last week, Chesapeake announced record fourth-quarter earnings that were 
1,736 percent higher than earnings for the same quarter in 1999. The company 
also reported a 2000 net income of $3.52 a share -- which means you can buy 
Chesapeake for a price that is less than three times the company's earnings. 
""No stock trades for three times earnings,"" said Mickey Thompson, executive 
vice president of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. ""The 
independent producers are all undervalued right now. Chesapeake is just the 
most undervalued."" 
Chesapeake is the 10th-largest independent producer of natural gas in the 
country. And natural gas, because of low supply and high demand, is one of 
the hottest commodities on the market. It's a huge money maker. 
So Chesapeake is in the right business at the right time -- and it's into it 
heavily. Natural gas accounts for almost 90 percent of all the business that 
Chesapeake does. 
This has already caught the attention of some prominent investment experts. 
Chuck Clough has picked Chesapeake as one of his favorite companies in his 
current favorite sector -- natural gas. And Clough isn't just anybody. Until 
a year ago, he was chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch. Shortly 
after he left, he established a hedge fund that returned 17 percent, after 
fees and costs, during an 11-month time period when the rest of the market 
slid -- and the Nasdaq tumbled 44 percent. 
Clough's young hedge fund now boasts $150 million in assets. 
He's not too worried about falling natural gas prices. He's invested 32 
percent of his portfolio in energy stocks and most of that in natural gas. 
He's convinced that companies like Chesapeake will begin trading for much 
more than two or three times their earnings -- and soon. 
Stephen Smith, a Houston analyst for Dain Rauscher Wessels, considers 
Chesapeake to be a top performer among the energy companies he covers. He is 
convinced the stock is undervalued and that -- even after gaining 326 percent 
last year -- Chesapeake will have another banner year in 2001. 
""Natural gas prices don't have to stay at $7, $8, $9 or $10 for them to have 
a good year,"" Smith said. ""The prices could drop to $4 or $5, and that would 
still be a wonderful doubling of what they used to be. If we can continue to 
see $4 gas prices, then I think that energy stocks -- and particularly 
Chesapeake -- will start to respond a bit more."" 
Thompson, who moves within local energy circles, is very optimistic. 
""The natural gas prices we lived with for most of the '90s will never come 
back,"" he said. ""I can see a scenario with $4 and $5 gas prices for a long, 
long time.""

ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14.  
The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a 
purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put 
in some of the buy/sale activity.

My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright 
one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days 
we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at 
Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add 
another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy

If you nom from Onshore straigt to Leach, you pay Comm (meaning without ACA
or GRI) and ACA, the ship Leach to TCO Citygate and pay Comm + ACA + GRI.
If you go from Leach to your TCO pool, you pay the same CGLF stuff and no
charge on TCO at all.

Next question, you have SST and you go from the pool to STOI, you pay the
SST Comm + ACA + GRI into storage.  When you use SST to go from STOW to the
Citygate, you only pay Comm, no ACA or GRI (i think).


Backs doing ok.  Going on vacation on the 9th and I can't wait.  And yes it
has been a stressfull bid week.  But you r probably making tons of dough.

I need a correct answer to my question... I know you will not lead me a
stray.

If I buy onshore, take it through mainline, take it through leach, and take
it to a delivered gate on TCO. Do I just pay GRI  once at TCO delivered
point. If I drop it off in TCO pool, then I pay the GRI there?? I can't
seem
to get a straight answer from my accountants and TCO. It looks like our
model is adding the GRI at each leg... opps.

Thank you sweetie!!!!

How's your bidweek... mine sucks!!!

Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us 
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

The invoiced rate on this contract is for  interruptible gathering but the 
information on the deal reflects a Firm contract. How do you suggest handling 
so the contract type, rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the 
pipeline?

Also, there are 10 contracts that we were invoiced for processing charges 
that are not on the Service List in Path Manager for Feb.
Are you working on getting contracts and deals added?

Can you help me with the below information?  I am looking to turn over our
local production.  After August we won't be in business anymore and this local
production that is in our name is really Enron North America's local
production.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local agg
pool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can 
turn
this production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to give
them formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identification
numbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).

I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get this
cleared up and seem to have no luck.

Thanks again for your help.

Please let me know if you need something more from me.  I understand that
Clinton Energy is setting up a pool and will soon be able to take over our

Re:     System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive negative
transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of receipts) on its
system over the past several days.  As of December 21, 2000, Shippers
are advised to avoid any additional negative imbalances as soon as
possible.

Additionally, until further notice, Transco will institute more
restrictive practices at its pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4%
tolerance currently allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for
Shippers with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will continue to be held
to the 4% tolerance levels.  Transco will not enforce these pool
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however,
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits identified
above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may proactively decrease
markets to bring them in line with supplies at pooling points.

Absent voluntary compliance with this notice, Transco may be required to
use any remedies available, up to and including reliance upon Section 52
of the General Terms and Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff, to
ensure it retains the appropriate level of operational flexibility.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-3361 or
John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.

"Jan sale to FirstEnergy @ Carroll Co Meter","CES is buying 2500 dth/day from Equitable in Tenn Z4.  CES is selling 2500 
dth/day to FirstEnergy in Tenn Z4.  Looks like a match to me.  I told Fred 
with Equitable the information John Singer gave to Phil below.  For future 
reference Fred's number is 412-395-3295.  A backup contact at Equitable is 
Steve Rafferty, 412-395-3268.

Per John, FirstEnergy bought the meter (??) from Beldon & Blake effective 
12/1/99.  On CNG, we are showing a purchase (deal 141688) and a sale (deal 
141952) for 2500 dth/day with Beldon & Blake.  I don't see a sale anywhere to 
FirstEnergy.  

Also, I still see an Equitable supply (deal 135956) on CNG for 3226 dth/day.  
I believe this is a duplicate of deal 138741 in Tetco M2.

This has to do with that TENN zone 4 deal that you e-mailed me about this
morning. Like I mentioned earlier, we never scheduled this gas, it was handled
on a back to back basis.

Phil,
FirstEnergy called to change the contract number for the sale I made to them
(originally to Belden & Blake) to be delivered to the Carroll Co Meter.  The
new contract number is 32082.
If you receive this email before you page me, that's what the page is about.
Call or email me with any questions.

Chris,
Most companies send us their fixed-price bidweek data in this format. It's 
more
accurate since we just have to transfer the data instead of retyping 
everything
into our master database. It also saves time on days like today when we have 
to
turn everything over in a day. Anyone with questions can give me a call --

AND, I want to hold back $79,000 of revenue on deal #401601.

The customer price is $5.7025 which is based on the following

Sales Price  $5.4850
Transport to Stoi $.1526  (I included $.0147 too much by accident)
Storge Injection  $.0249
Capacity Demand $.0400

Total Price  $5.7025

We will overinject in October by about 362,000 dth to max out storage by Oct 
31.  Since we will not estimate the transport expense until Oct, I want to 
hold back roughly 362,000 dth x $.2175 = $79,000.00  (close enough).

is $.0155 (no GRI) and fuel is around $.09 at $4.00.

The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from 
one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of 
nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title 
transfer fee.  TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user 
customer.  Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool 
DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler  they would not be charged the title transfer 
fee.   However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU  
(marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee.

We cannot let you balance your mdq across the month but we can offer a low
IT discount rate on top of the firm.  (this equates back to the effective
rate you were looking for.  You can change the amount of firm higher if you
like and then the ratio of IT at the cheap rate will also incease.  Your
cheap IT rate can be up to a volume of 50% of your firm.   After that it
would be max rate it.

I will be out this afternoon and Thursday but will call you from the road.

Subject: Re: Storage Questions



Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  Cove Point LNG is a peaking facility.  There are three 10-day peaking
contracts for 50,000 Dthd each or a total of 150,000 Dthd of peaking 
capability
by delivery from the Cove Point pipeline into the east side of TCO's system.
The gas can also go directly into Washington Gas Light or into PEPCO's Chalk
Point electric generation facility.  The variable transport cost on Cove Point
LNG is less than $0.005/Dth.  This gas was hedged by CES as baseload 
withdrawal
during the January 1999, but can be withdrawn any time before the end of the
contracts which is 2/29/2000.

2.  The TCO storage is the CES retail storage.  Enron's contract with CES
retail contains the withdrawal schedule for this storage.  I would work with 
Ed
McMichael's group who should be getting this schedule from CES Retail.

Subject: Storage Questions



I have 2 storage questions for now.

1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking 
facility.
The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or
were you going to use this as peaking gas?


2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current 
storage
balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??






thanks

Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have 
these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need 
to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;

   ""Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011"".

If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they 
send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM

get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and 
transmission contracts moved over.

changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss 
this with CALP (and she may have already)
     However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.

This contract is on the ECT April spreadsheet under CES Wholesale.  What is 
the relationship between ENA and Commonwealth Atlantic?
(Who pays transport invoice?  Any reimbursements?)

1) What is the status of CNG Producing Company  - Deal #77755?  The contract  
was called Trag 110, 
and I see that in the service list on CNG Transmission, but it needs to be 
pathed starting 07/99 through current.
Also, the rates are showing up as:
Transportation       $.19910     but should be $.06
ACA                           $.00220     Should not be paying ACA
Compression          $.00000    Should be $.22

2)   What is the status of CNG Field Services - Deal #125711 (Marco Pipeline) 
- Coronado Pipeline  Enterprises?

I have more, but do you think that we could get these 2  taken care of 
today?  Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .

1.  We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for 
production months older than 12/1999.  This allows us to focus our efforts on 
current month.  Per Bryce, applaud here! 

2.  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected 
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.

3.  Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected 
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.

4.  Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator.  Changes should be made 
effective 12/1999 production forward.  

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions.  If 
necessary, please forward to your teams.
Thanks,
Carrie

Subject: Rates Corrections

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates 
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999.  (Applause 
here!)  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled via a manual line item.  

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date, 
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type.  For example, if you are 
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity.  Same 
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be 
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting.  Any 
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close.  The Rates team will 
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31.  This should allow you time to 
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we 
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within 
Unify/Sitara.  Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by 
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and 
reversed by the end of the same accounting month.  For items that have been 
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be 
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management 
coordinator.  They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production 
forward.  

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by 
the end of 2/2000 accounting...  Once the numbers booked in Unify are final, 
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

								CapacityCenter.com research results show that the pipeline capacity release 
marketplace is responding positively to the price cap removal provisions of 
Order 637. 
								
								A look at the past few months reveals an increase of almost 500% in the 
number of over-max-rate deals since the months just after the ruling went 
into effect. Traders and contract owners alike are taking advantage of new 
opportunities.
								
								The research shows an overall increase in the size, duration and pricing of 
the release deals, indicating that many sellers prefer to be paid directly 
for their contracts rather than incur the risk involved in the purchase, 
transport and delivery of gas in order to generate margin.
								
								Capacity release trading is starting to mirror the more competitive 
marketplace, which is what the FERC hoped for in countering the ""bundled 
deal"" gray market.

Subject: Tennessee's CanEast Project and Transco's MarketLink Expansion

Tennessee is finalizing their CanEast project which will scoop the 
Independence Pipeline effort and allow Tennessee to deliver 280,000 Dthd into 
Leidy beginning in 11/1/01 at the same time the first phase of Transco's 
MarketLink begins.  The first phase of MarketLink has a capacity of 166,000 
Dthd and the second phase is scheduled to begin 11/1/02 with an additional 
130,000 Dthd.  Tennessee was the successful bidder on a recent open season 
that National Fuel had for 19,100 Dthd of space between Niagara and Leidy.  
Tennessee has executed a 10 year lease for the space.  They will use this 
capacity and a 10 year lease arrangement that they are finalizing with 
Dominion Transmission for Ellisburg to Leidy capacity to form the basis of 
their CanEast Project.  The Dominion lease will allow Tennessee to use 
unsubscribed Zone L to Zone 4 capacity and deliver approximately 260,000 Dthd 
from the Gulf Coast to Leidy.  (Dynegy negotiated an index-based, revenue 
sharing contract with Tennessee for delivery into Dominion using this 
capacity for the 11/1/00 - 10/31/01 period).  Tennessee is currently 
negotiating with shippers to subscribe to the CanEast capacity.  They are 
willing to negotiate contracts less than ten years and have negotiated terms 
that synch up with the second phase of MarketLink.  This should allow 
available capacity from the Gulf Coast or Niagara to Leidy or secondary 
delivery points such as Dominion (since Phase I of MarketLink is set) for one 
year contracts.

As a reminder, firm shippers with binding contracts on MarketLink are:


Phase I (11/1/01 start)   Volume  Delivery Point  Comment

Aquila Energy Marketing    25,000 Dthd Manhattan(Con Ed) Option to change to
          11/1/02 start date
Consolidated Edison     30,000  Manhattan(Con Ed)
ConEdison Energy     10,000  Manhattan(Con Ed)
St. Lawrence Cement       1,000  Camden
Williams Energy Marketing  100,000  Manhattan(Con Ed)

Total Phase I    166,000 Dthd

Phase II (11/1/02)

Virginia Power Energy Marketing 100,000 Dthd Trenton-Woodbury Non-New York
PPL Energy Plus     30,000  Princeton Junction Non-New York

Total Phase II    130,000 Dthd

Transco has until the end of April 2001 to file additional binding executed 
contracts with the FERC for an additional 404,000 Dthd of Leidy to New York 
capacity or the MarketLink Expansion as approved by FERC will be limited to 
the 296,000 Dthd of the first two phases.

Why doesn't Enron promote from within.... same old story. It just took a
long time before EOL had the markets out there.

I leave Tuesday evening. There is a dinner Monday night... you should get
an
invite... since Goodell has to do the family thing... as always.

What happen to Dick??

Scott is your main man - I guess.  I don't know if he is going to keep
doing it or if he's going to hire an analyst.  I think Susan will be doing
Texas Eastern.  Mr. Goodell will be going to the CGAS/TCO meeting on
Tuesday.  I may be going Tues afternoon.

When do you leave Houston?

Vickey told me yesterday was her last day. I see Scott Neal is on Tenn Z0.

There are no quotes out there... just for Enron's info.

I'll be in town this weekend.. going to TCO/Gulf meeting Monday and
Tuesday.
Hope to see you.

Hope your back and other aches are okay.

Per Sherry, Global Counterparty is recognizing CES - Cove Point as the

The reason is lack of the appropriate paperwork executed by the

APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE

POSTED May 23, 2000

Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative 
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression 
into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a 
limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make 
this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a 
period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and 
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for 
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE 
compressor station.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405.   
Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental 
capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental 
capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the 
limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.  
Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it 
receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.  
Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing 
time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure 
that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other 
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression 
in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights 
to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more 
requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for 
which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed 
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should 
be included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after 
June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  
Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close 
after Noon on June 23, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value 
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on 
this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

Chris;

Can you send me confirmation on the deals that were done for COH outside the
Enron-CES agreement.
The IF Index for TCO App pool is 4.53 +.0175+.02+transport.  Can you confirm
each market area delivery point with volume and delivered price.
I need a confirmation record for our files since we are buying this gas
on-behalf of someone else.

thanks - Charlie

Chris,

How impersonal and Late so first - my apologies.  No excuses but this week 
has been unbelievable.  

I hope that you had an incredible Birthday - I guess you started early since 
I did try to call on Frid.  I hope it was fun.

I bought my self a new BD car!  Kind of exciting.

Today a few of us in my group are headed to the London office! So In my haste 
I wanted to be sure and at least send you a belated birthday wish.

Stephanie

Colleen,

The main reason I am uncomfortable about using the service p&l is because 
Chris, Dan, and Judy are uncomfortable with it.  As soon as they are happy 
with it, we are ready to use it.

Why are you still not comfortable using the service p&l, at least for demand 
charges?
What system resources are you talking about?




To: Colleen Sullivan/HOU/ECT@ECT

Colleen,

I think the reason that they haven't moved has been one of timing.  Chris has 
not had time to pull them out of their spreadsheets and put them onto 
another.  This, of course, has led to the obvious point that we are still not 
comfortable using the service P&L from unify.  When Scott gets back next 
week, we will together with him and Dick to verify what needs to be moved and 
take care of it manually until system resources can handle it.

David

David
Is there some reason why we are not allocating demand charges for the market 
area pipes to the Market East p&l?  If the only reason is that you're not 
sure which ones to do, this is my suggestion.  It seems to me that there are 
only three pipelines where there is overlap and that would be Tennessee, 
Texas Eastern and Transco.  For now, why don't we leave all the demand 
charges for those three pipes, plus all others not listed below, with the 
East p&l, and move the following pipe demand charges to the Market East 
book:  Algonquin, Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Natural Resources, CNG, 
Cove Point, Equitrans, Gatherco, Iroquois, Marco, National Fuel.

Obviously you need to confirm this with Dick and Scott, but this seems to 
make sense to me.  Please advise.

Anyone who's been single and over the age of 18 can relate to this.

When I was younger I hated going to weddings ...it seemed that all of my

Angie/Chris

Just an FYI update on the Iroquois 06/26 parking issue.  This might be 
redundant, but the history is that Iroquois notified us on 07/26/00 that we 
were cut 364 MMBtu's (from 24,502 to 24,138) @ Canajoharie on the evening 
cycle of 06/26/00 (yes, exactly one month lag in notification), & the cut 
volume was placed into PALS.  As I understand it, the late notification was a 
trickle down, i.e. Beth @ CNG notified Iroquois on 07/26, & Iroquois notified 
us when they found out.  Anyway, the 364 MMBtu's are on the August 
Transportation Statement as a beginning balance on 08/01, not withdrawn, 
incurring parking charges of $173.77 for the month (364 MMBtu's x 31 days = 
11,284 MMBtu's @ $0.0154 = $173.77).  Per Angie's previous e:mail on this 
item, it sounds like we've got a problem with the late notification, & this 
parking charge is related, & so, may be disputable.  Either way, the volume's 
currently not in Unify as parked, & will not show up on the Service 
Verification at present.  

Are there any updates to the status on this item?  Thanks.

Brad-

I got your message this morning, and I'm not ignoring you- I have just been 
extremely busy with bid week activities and cleaning for August.  I think I 
know what you're talking about, and I handed that issue over to Chris Germany 
earlier this month.  I have not followed up with it since then, and that is 
my fault.  The main problem I have with this that we were not notified about 
the volume change until later the NEXT MONTH which would not be a timely 
notification by any means.  I think that Chris was looking into this issue 
with Colleen Sulllivan, because of the late notification.  I will badger 
Chris in the morning, but I can't guarantee an answer until later this week 
after the dust has settled from the 1st.  Thanks for understanding.  -Angie

discounts could be taken....well, I need it done for 12/99 now.
The total volumes for CNG/Sabine for 12/99 are
7,676,198 and we should be paying $13,298.60 for at rate of .00172794.
Let me know if you need more information, or copies, or whatever.  And

Chris-

This rate change implements a rate settlement reached in 1999, so we don't 
have grounds for protest.  I'll bookmark the issue for review when Transco 
files it's next Section 4 on March 1st.  We can argue that the backhaul rates 
should be cost based, as opposed tothe full forward haul rate that's being 
charged.

I left a message for the manager of Transco's Rates Department to call me.  
If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities 
are the same now.  In Jan, the ""true backhaul"" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was 
$.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges.  We actually did 
some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.

I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until 
October, after the summer period?

Subject: CES Central Desk Issues

I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point 
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon 
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one 
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it 
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.


Comments?

Transport
I have the CES transport split between Wholesale and Retail.  For the 1st, 
all CES transport will be in a file all to itself.  The file is located 
at o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls.   We have most of the 
retail contacts in Sitara, there should be a deal number in column U.

Most of our transport problems for the 1st will come from the asset

Subject: April '00 FOM numbers for CES


Chris--Attached is the spreadsheet that we spoke of earlier today.  I have 
made
the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I
will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes.
As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off
Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and 
as
I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm 
basis
with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage
injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the
price for all of the  April storage injections.

I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract 
for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end 
effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  

I entered the following deals at a zero commodity
470563  Buy exchange
470582  Sell Cpr Storage

470587 Buy CPR Storage
470568 Sell exchange


I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through 
March 31.  

I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.

I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans?
Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts
and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).
Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.

Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with 
the
end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing shipper 
is
and the primary receipt and delivery points.

Thanks

Doug, we billed you incorrectly for June on the CGAS storage.  We should have 
billed you for 1,089,289 but we only entered 497,015 in our system.  We will 
get that fixed.

Subject: Theoretical Storage Inventories


Scott and Chris--Yesterday, I asked Scott if you guys could provide me with a
summary of the volumes of gas sold to CES during April, May, June, and July 
for
the theoretical storage services under our 12/99 Agreement with ENA.   
Attached
is a file that I prepared showing the theoretical storage injections for the 4
storage services as they appear on ENA's monthly invoices.   I note that the
June injection for the TCO storage appears to be only about half of what we
requested and what appears in our GMS system.  My ultimate objective here is 
to
provide The New Power Company with  definitive estimates of the end-of-July
inventories (including left-over inventory from last winter) as well as the
volumes ""injected"" in July alone.  I hope the attached file helps.   If we
could get this resolved next week, that would be great.

Subject: Re: SST Storage Injection Contract for Choice - PLEASE READ  

Jeff Porter at CES said in a 3/16 email...

 as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
 submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
 the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
 made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
 Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
 3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

Which means we will not have the volumes until 3/17.  Is it a problem that it 
wasn't March 15?

The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our 
agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our 
storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're 
coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call 
them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it 
together.

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

The STOCK MARKET closed sharply higher on Thursday following the
release of today's report on retail sales for April, which was down.
Today's report eased trader fears about rising interest rates
however; it is unlikely that it will cause the Fed. to abandon its
current policy of higher interest rates until there is further
evidence of a slow-down in the US economy. Technically, today's
action appears corrective in nature leaving the door open for
sideways too lower prices on Friday. It will take closes above
trendline resistance crossing near 10,760 to temper the near-term
bearish outlook in the Dow.

JUNE BONDS closed higher on Thursday following today's release of
friendly retail sales data. This week's rebound off the 62%
retracement level of this year's rally crossing at 92-31 has allowed
June to challenging initial trendline resistance crossing near 94-09.
Multiple closes above this resistance level would signal a minor low
might be in place.
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/USM0-daily.html

CRB INDEX surged to new highs for the second day in a row confirming
Wednesday's trading range breakout above 217.88. Sharp gains in
energies supported today's rally in the CRB, which has renewed its
long-term uptrend. I would not be surprised to see the CRB trade
sideways too lower on Friday as it consolidates some of this week's
gains and possibly retest broken resistance at 217.88. However, this
week's move to new highs has opened the door for a possible test of
weekly resistance at 223.23 later this month.
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/NYCE/CRY0-daily.html

CURRENCIES the June Dollar closed higher on Thursday following
Wednesday's late-session turnaround. The setback off last week's low
as the appearance of a potential bull flag. Closes into new highs
would confirm an upside breakout of weekly resistance at 111.37,
which would open the door for a possible test of the 1981 high at
114.88 later this spring. The Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower on
Thursday with the D-mark gapping down and closing below long-term
support at .4624. Closes below last week's lows in both markets are
needed to renew this spring's declines. The June Japanese Yen posted
a key reversal up after session lows fell short of the Feb. low at
.9125. Additional gains on Friday would confirm today's reversal
pattern however; June needs to close above .9394 to confirm a
short-term bottom has likely been posted.

PRECIOUS METALS closed mixed on Thursday. June gold posted a new low
close for the week and in doing so turned a number of short-term
momentum indicators bearish. Follow-through weakness on Friday could
set the stage for a possible test of May's low at 273.60 in the near
future. July silver closed lower following Wednesday's inside day
increasing the odds July will try and test this spring's double
bottom at 4.975. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for
sideways trading on Friday. July copper closed slightly higher on
Thursday after probing last week's gap. Momentum indicators are
overbought and turning bearish warning bulls, time is running out and
downside risk is increasing. Closes below gap support at 82.40 would
confirm a short-term top has been posted.

http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/COMEX/GCM0-daily.html

GRAINS closed higher on fund buying and NOAA weather forecast. July
corn posted an inside day with a fractionally higher close as traders
digested Wednesday's bullish long-range weather forecast from NOAA.
Light consolidation ahead of Friday's supply/demand report also
limited today's gains. NOAA is still calling for a potential drought
this summer, as LaNina is likely to persist through August. A steady
too higher close on Friday sets the stage a possible resumption of
last week's rally next week if hot/dry weather returns to the
Midwest. July wheat gapped up and closed sharply higher for the
second day in a row due to strong fund related buying. Expectations
for a friendly supply/demand report on Friday and bullish weather
forecast have been the driving factors behind this week's rally.
Today's close above minor resistance at 2.78 1/2 makes March's high
at 2.84 July's next target, then this winter's high at 2.95 1/2. The
rising ADX signals additional short-term gains are possible during
May. http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/CN0-daily.html
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/WN0-daily.html

SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed steady to lower due to consolidation ahead of
Friday's supply/demand reports. July beans posted an inside day in
relatively quiet trading ahead of tomorrow's reports. Never the less,
this week's rally is turning a number of short-term momentum
indicators neutral too bullish leaving July poised to renew this
year's rally if the weather turns hot and dry next week. Closes above
5.82 1/2 would confirm the uptrend has resumed. July soybean meal
spiked to new highs before light profit taking tempered today's
meager gain. Today's high-range close leaves July poised to extend
this month's move to new highs if Friday's reports come in neutral to
friendly. July bean oil closed lower on Thursday in narrow trading as
the market remains poised to extend its decline off May's high should
Friday's reports come in neutral to bearish. Today's bearish export
sales report does not bode well for the longer-term outlook in bean
oil. If the decline resumes, the 50% retracement level of this
spring's rally at 17.50 is July's next target.

http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/SMN0-daily.html
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/BON0-daily.html

LIVESTOCK closed lower on Thursday pressured by weaker cash and
product prices. June hogs closed slightly lower but near session
highs as the market attempted to consolidate recent losses amidst a
sharp rebound in bellies. However, lower cash bids and additional
long-liquidation limited to day's rebound as the market is
consolidating above minor support at 71.96. Momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling further losses are possible later this
month. June cattle closed into new lows for the week confirming
Wednesday's trendline breakout. Today's close below April's low at
68.22 sets the stage for a test of March's low at 67.70 in the near
future. Expectations for rising grain prices and declining boxed beef
prices continues to weigh on prices.
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CME/LHM0-daily.html
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CME/LCM0-daily.html

FOOD & FIBER closed mixed on Thursday. July coffee continues to drift
sideways ahead of the May 19 retention plan meeting. July sugar
closed on spec. buying on ideas world surplus should continue to
shrink due to lower production levels in Brazil and other sugar
producing nations. Profit taking ahead of the close tempered today's
gains. July needs to close above 675 to renew this spring's rally.
July cocoa gapped up and closed higher due to fund short covering.
Today's high is challenging this spring's downtrend line crossing
near 830. Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to
confirm a bottom and trend change. Momentum indicators are turning
bullish signaling additional gains are possible. I would not be
surprised to see an inside day on Friday as July consolidates some of
today's gains. July cotton posted a potential key reversal down on
Thursday after session highs fell short of testing the 75%
retracement level of this spring's decline at 62.76. Today's
mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday.
Bullish short-term weather forecast for West Texas and the southeast
US will continue to underpin prices. Momentum indicators are bullish
and suggest additional gains are possible.

The ENERGY MARKETS closed higher on Thursday with July heating oil
posting a new contract high today. July crude oil has retraced over
75% of this spring's decline setting the stage for a possible test of
March's high at 30.46 later this spring.

please let me know if this is incorrect.

ENA delivered gas to Dayton's TGT citygate.  In return, Dayton is giving ENA 
gas at various CGAS citygates.  There are no fees for this transaction.  The 
TGT deal is 152766, the CGAS deal is 153213.  The volumes on these deals 
should match.  Also, Dayton should not be using any ENA supply (pool gas or 
ENA storage) to supply the CGAS citygate volume.

Comments/questions?

Victor, I did not put a meter number on the CGAS deal.  

Also, it's time to introduce Steve Gillespie to Sitara.

Chris and all--Below is our volume request for July 7-31 for C&I customers

Please provide Kara with contract numbers in the morning.  Also, could you
please provide the pricing on this deal?  Thanks.

"Peoples","Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
  Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will 
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this.

Subject: Re: Peoples  

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

no-notice storage for NOPSI and it might be related to that.  Do you know 
what Koch storage contracts we had for the 2000 tax year?

We also received a bill for Sonat Bear Creek storage.  I assume this would

Subject:  Theoretical Storage


We need to reach an agreement on the theoretical storage as CES needs to
transfer to NPC a specific volume and price for COH, and AGL ESS, WSS and
Sonat. I had thought we had an understanding that CES would be billed, per
Melissa's memo of 3/15 and conversations during June, the percentages times
the
current month's storage capacity. We may have confused you by sending FOM
noms
for storage injections that were different than that formula, and Doug has
noticed the bills from ENA tend to represent the noms.

How should this be resolved? Should we go on ENA billed volumes or by the
formula? Let me know.
My calculations per the formula would give us the following balances for
7/31/00...
COH-4,053,906
AGL-Sonat- 504,379
AGL-ESS-9,827
AGL-WSS-220,209

For January, I moved 2 deals from Trco Non NY to CGAS/WGL meter 78-30.  Both 
deals are sales to New Power.

Deal Volume
377268 5 (yes thats right 5 dt's)
377264 475

Kimat, you need to do some of that voodoo economic stuff because this deal 
has hedges.

Joann & Alvin, this will not be part of the Citygate deal for Choice, this is 
a citygate sale to New Power at WGL.

OK this is metered production on CNG.

Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with.
The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES 
production.

After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal 
in Sitara with a zero volume.

Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I 
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.  
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of 
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So 
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria

Subject: CNG Sabine Hub Services

As per our conversation today, we will set up a new service for contract 
I00059 that will be ""Park and Lend"".

I talked with Scott Mills regarding the Sitara end; he said two tickets were 
necessary:

 1.  An Exchange ticket with the counterparty ""CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE"" (when 
done with the pipeline) and
 2.  A Storage Capacity Ticket with the pipeline (CNG Sabine Hub Services) as 
the counterparty.  This is where you
  will set up the rate you have negotiated with the pipeline and the service 
that Molly can path on so as to
  get the correct rate for the service.

I will check with Kirk Lenart to confirm the correct way for Global to set 
this up and I will let you know so you may select it on your deal ticket.

Subject: Update from India



Friends,
Greetings from India.  Just a brief update to let you all know what is
happening.  This week I finished a 3 week teaching course on the Book of
Romans, with 8 students from one of the schools in Kodai.  I think that is
the most exciting thing I have ever done in my life.  I asked the students
one day who lead them to Christ.  Everyone single one of them have been
saved through the ministry that I and Jonathan Daniels have been doing in
their school over the last year.  But what was even more exciting than that
was the fact that only one of them was from a Christian family.  All of the
others were from Hindu families, except one who was from a Muslim family.
That young man's name is Anifa.  He came to Christ through one of the
pograms I did last year at his school. In just one year he has grown so
much, and is known campus wide as young man of integrity and devotion to
Christ.  Already he has lead several other young men to the Lord.  Anifa
will honestly spend hours at a time waiting on God, and the whole school
knows that he is a man of prayer.  Recently Anifa asked me if I would teach
him how to preach, because he said he believes that God wants him to go back
and reach his people for Jesus.
Until Anifa shared his testimony with me, I was getting a little frustrated,
because I thought that in all of my time here in India, I had not won a
single Muslim to Christ.  Now I can leave Kodaikanal confidently, because I
have won one young man to Christ, and I know that he will win many others.
Please be praying for a team from North Texas District lead by John Bates,
and a team from San Antonio First Assembly of God lead by Andy Hostetler.
They will be coming in June and July.  We will be starting 2 new Churches,
and ministering in the schools.
And please continue to pray for the new Church in Shenoy Nagar that was
started last summer by the team from Southwestern.
I look forward to seeing you all this year.  Angela and I are praying about
God's direction for our future.  Please pray with us that for God's guidance
as we plan for our future together.  God bless.

Chad Germany

Bethlehem    no idle capacity (spot deals using it right now)
Allied Signal    no idle capacity

Since Enron is not using all of CES contracts, did not look at Columbia Gulf 
(Mainline), 

Fuel Management Reps for CES:
Fred Lombardo  Int Paper/Bethlehem Steel 724-873-1300
John Whited  Aristech Chem   724-873-1300
Lee Tippet  Allied Signal   614-481-1160

Before doing deals, please check with me to ensure this capacity is still 
available.

Let me know if you need anything else.

CGAS - we may not release any VNG CGAS capacity to ENA.  According to CGAS, 
we may loose some of our flexibility with the contract.  Scott is waiting to 
hear from CGAS.  At this point, we will not release the capacity effective 
for the 1st.

Tenn -  I do not have the new contract numbers yet.  Per Tenn - Scott will 
send a letter to Tenn requesting that the VNG discounts be transferred to the 
new ENA contracts.

Trco - Trco has a capacity release ""glitch"" in their EBB and needs to 
""temporarily flip a switch"" while I do the capacity releases.  Since I know 
Trco well, I've decided to wait until after the 1st to do the releases in 
case their are EDI issues with the ""switch flipping"".  AND we would not know 
about any problems until the 31st.

Also, VNG has 35,930 dth of telescoped Trco capacity.  Williams has 15,930 
dth of the VNG capacity because of the FS service.  I will release 20,000 dth 
to ENA.  This will eliminate the overlapping problems we have with Williams.

demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 
900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 
310,000  for Dec
310,000 for Jan
280,000 for Feb

Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of 
this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge.  
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for 
the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?

Subject: CGAS deal 213360

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I 
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.

Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I 
believe its in the deal correctly.

Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a ""Put to COH at IF"" or 
something real intelligent like that.

This deal goes thru 2/28/01.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...


Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there cannot be a 
nativity scene in Washington, D.C. this Christmas. The Court ruling is not 
based on the seperation of Church and State  Simply put, the  Court felt it 
could not find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol. However, 
finding enough Asses to fill the stable would not be a problem.

"Volunteer","I need a volunteer.  The ""Vol"" will be responsible for pricing all of The New 
Power deals in the market area.   99% of this activity takes place on CGAS.  

Who wants it?  Certain people have expressed an interest in learning  more 
about pricing, Tricia Spence, Joe Casas, and Beverly  Beaty.



I estimate it will take about 15 minites a day during the month, and about 
4-6 hours during bidweek.  I also believe this deal will go away effective 
4/1/2001.

Pros
Will learn the concept of a physical bookout - will become a Sitara pricing 
guru like myself.
Will learn a great deal about transport pricing.
May lead into executing capacity on CGLK and CGAS - I will not turn this over 
until I am satisfied with the Vol's performance on pricing. 
Can easily be done after the work day crunch (this may be a pro or a con)
Will learn more about the pricing curves and how physical deals impact the 
desk P&L.



Cons
Somewhat tedious - not as bad as it used to be.
May have to anwser Dick Jenkins questions.  
I will have to assign this to Scott or Vickie if I don't get a volunteer.
I will do the training - possibly in the evening or on the weekend, AND I'm 
very detail oriented.
I will provide feedback on this persons progress and I take this part of the 
job very serious.

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage

At the minimum, I'm looking for an offer for a flat baseload volume for 
December flow.  My preference is to get an offer for a flat baseload volume 
from December through March.  The points and volumes are:
 Delmont {Volume:  3,712/day}
 Windrifge {Volume:  2,859/day}

Can I get a nymex plus offer?

think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this

This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month

Computer Gender

An English teacher was explaining to the students
the
concept of gender
association in the English language; noting how
hurricanes at one time were
given only female names, and how ships and planes
were
usually referred to
as ""she."" One of the students raised her hand and
asked,
""What gender is a
computer?""

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class
into two
groups:  males
in one, females in the other, and asked them to
decide if
a computer should
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked
to give
four reasons for
their recommendations.

    The group of women concluded that computers
should be
referred to as
masculine because:

1. In order to get their attention, you have to
turn them
on.

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.

3. They are supposed to help you solve your
problems, but
half the time,
they ARE the problem.

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that,
if you
had waited a
little longer, you could have had a better model.

    The men, on the other hand, decided that
computers
should definitely be
referred to as feminine because:

1. No one but their creator understands their
internal
logic.

2. The native language they use to communicate
with other
computers is
incomprehensible to everyone else.

3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in
long-term
memory for later
retrieval.

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you
find
yourself spending half
your paycheck on accessories for it.

Good job Chris.

My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to 
pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to 
enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also 
think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she 
may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.  

Comments?

Subject: Iroquois Gas

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago, 
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented 
capacity.  Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the 
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement 
shipper.  Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not) 
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible.  For instance, 
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the 
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy 
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on 
Iroquois' system?  Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?

Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments 
on this issue.  I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

Thanks.

CanFibre is working on getting a guarantee.

OK - I'm tossing all my info on CanFibre.

"Re: Iroquois Parking Dispute","Good job Chris.

My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to 
pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to 
enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also 
think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she 
may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.  

Comments?

You are cordially invited to attend one of Transco's three regionally
scheduled 2000 Winter Operations and 1Line meetings.

The meetings are scheduled as follows:

This year's Winter Operations Meetings have been expanded to include a
variety of material that will be of interest to all customers. The meetings
will focus on three specific areas:  (1) the traditional update on
operational plans for the winter, maintenance outages planned for next year
and a customer service update; (2) a 1Line update and discussion on business

practice changes that will require tariff changes; and (3) a review and
discussion of the EDI and flat file datasets for nominations, confirmations
and schedule quantity reports targeted at those customers and their
information technology staff who have expressed an interest in this
information.  Transco will also be holding a pre-filing meeting in
Washington
DC specifically to address the tariff changes associated with implementation

of the 1Line system.  That meeting will be held in mid-November and
customers
will be notified as to time and location in the near future.

The meetings in Newark and Charlotte will start at 9:00 a.m. and end at
approximately 4:00 p.m.  Coffee, juice and pastries will be provided before
the meeting and lunch will be served at approximately 11:30 a.m.  The
Houston
meeting will start at 12:30 p.m. and end at approximately 5:00 p.m.
Refreshments will be provided mid-afternoon.

The agenda for the Newark and Charlotte meetings as well as the Houston
meeting is included below.  Please note that the agenda for the Houston
meeting is significantly different than the other meetings.

Please RSVP to Rosina Freeman at 713-215-4054 or via e-mail at
rosina.l.freeman@williams.com no later than Wednesday, October 25, 2000 so
that we can have an accurate count for each meeting.

This is slightly revised.

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the

Subject: Re: Terminating Transco contracts  

My only comment to this is to please make sure the contracts have IMNE and 
IMME as desks since most of them will be market area deliveries.  They are
already in Unify and the multiple desks may be all we need to path them.  The 
Transco schedulers are also going to have to know the receipt and delivery
points that are primary for all these contracts with Transco changes among 
other things.

August 12th is open for rafting.  The Royle Gorge section will be low,
so we do not have to rent wetsuits.  But, you can if you want to.  The
price is $86.89/person.  If we get 12 or more people it's $78.20/person.


I have not heard from all of you yet, so please let me know if you are
interested.  Mary is looking into the camp site.

I'll send another e-mail soon with updates.  :-)

Subject: market exits


Chris,

As I indicated on our call about a week ago, CES Retail is attempting to exit 
a
number of current markets for Major Accounts business only.  The list that
we're contemplating includes CKY, CG&E, DP&L, East Ohio, Indiana Gas, Western
Kentucky, CVA, COH, and BGE.  Again, for those LDCs where we participate in
Choice programs, we will continue to serve those customers.

We are trying to have this accomplished prior to March flow so that we can 
take
March 2000 forward out of our physical requirements from Enron.

I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available.

Thanks,

Melissa

"CES Central Desk Issues","I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point 
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon 
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one 
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it 
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.

Subject: Rates Corrections

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .

1.  We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for 
production months older than 12/1999.  This allows us to focus our efforts on 
current month.  Per Bryce, applaud here! 

2.  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected 
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.

3.  Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected 
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.

4.  Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator.  Changes should be made 
effective 12/1999 production forward.  

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions.  If 
necessary, please forward to your teams.
Thanks,
Carrie

Subject: Rates Corrections

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates 
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999.  (Applause 
here!)  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled via a manual line item.  

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date, 
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type.  For example, if you are 
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity.  Same 
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be 
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting.  Any 
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close.  The Rates team will 
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31.  This should allow you time to 
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we 
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within 
Unify/Sitara.  Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by 
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and 
reversed by the end of the same accounting month.  For items that have been 
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be 
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management 
coordinator.  They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production 
forward.  

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by 
the end of 2/2000 accounting...  Once the numbers booked in Unify are final, 
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

Singer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Re: storage clarification & issues  

Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2:  The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month 
changes does appear to be an issue.  Since the contract didn't spell out in 
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we 
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly 
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location.  I know Chris 
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not 
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie.  I will ask that he forward 
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP.  Let me know if 
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3.  Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms 
here.   Here is what is happening:  Your people are nominating this 
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations), 
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction.  That 
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.   We are 
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between 
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual 
contract prices with the producers.  So, this is one issue we will have to 
address as indemnification items.  That's problem one.  Problem two is that I 
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all 
the nominations.  We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is 
what you want).  For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the 
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from 
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.   I'll 
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4.  Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like 
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the 
pipeline invoices on to you.  Maybe we should change this process to one 
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his 
confirmation and review of all the charges.  This means you may see quite a 
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something.  Let us know what 
you would prefer.  Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that 
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to 
your office yesterday, March 29.  Chris will get all remaining demand charge 
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is 
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7.  I apologize for the delay.

5.  Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a 
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on 
Monday.  Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you?  If not, please 
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory 
balances.

Subject: storage clarification & issues

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

Sorry about the phone call -- kinda difficult being discreet around here --

Yes! I'd definitely like to meet anytime this week.  Lunchtime might be

I'm available

any evening this week.  Just let me know!


I also spoke with Marde @ EES.  She says that ""Tom Hermanic"" from her group
will

be calling me soon as well.  It appears that they could use a good

Marde and the Job# as is posted on the Enron company job site (online).
Just reading

 Let's keep in touch, Chris!  Thanks for calling me!

								CapacityCenter.com research results show that the pipeline capacity release 
marketplace is responding positively to the price cap removal provisions of 
Order 637. 
								
								A look at the past few months reveals an increase of almost 500% in the 
number of over-max-rate deals since the months just after the ruling went 
into effect. Traders and contract owners alike are taking advantage of new 
opportunities.
								
								The research shows an overall increase in the size, duration and pricing of 
the release deals, indicating that many sellers prefer to be paid directly 
for their contracts rather than incur the risk involved in the purchase, 
transport and delivery of gas in order to generate margin.
								
								Capacity release trading is starting to mirror the more competitive 
marketplace, which is what the FERC hoped for in countering the ""bundled 
deal"" gray market.

Subject: Storage on TCO - PLEASE READ

To ensure everyone is on the same page.... Steve Stonestreet at TCO and I had 
a conversation on how TCO works its storage ratchets. Steve, if I have 
misstated something, please let us know.

There is a FSS schedule that tells the ratchets, minimum injections, maximum 
withdrawals, etc. This FSS schedule has been updated in the attached 
spreadsheet with Enron's SCQ and Enron's MDSQ, which enables Enron to know 
its different volume requirements.

Based on the attached schedule, each month there are different Maximum 
Monthly Injection Quantities (MMIQ)  based on Enron's SCQ. There is no 
Minimum Injection Quantity required by TCO.

TCO Injection Session and % of SCQ;

April = 15%
May = 20%
June = 20%
July = 20%
Aug = 20%
Sept = 13%
Oct = 7 %

If you add these months up, the total Injection is 115%. Essentially, 
shippers have an extra 15% that does not have to be used during the injection 
period. Please note, Shippers can inject all year around on TCO (November is 
5% and December through March is 10%... typically not done).

For example, Shippers do not have to inject the ratchet amount in April 
(15%). If the Shipper falls behind on the STOI, and the Shipper needs to 
catch up on STOI in the future months, and the Shipper wants to go over the 
ratchet level for that month, then TCO will need to give its prior approval 
(I sound like a lawyer). Typically, TCO is more willing to approve 
overinjections in the early months of the injection session versus 
overinjecting in September and October, when TCO is full. 


Some other basic rules;

Shippers do not have to fill storage 100% by October.

Shippers cannot have more than  60% in storage by June 1st, unless 
overinjection is approved by TCO.

Shippers can have daily net withdrawals in the summer, and it works the same 
way it did in the Winter. Depending on the % SCQ, this will determine the 
MDWQ. As of today, 8.3% is in the ground so Enron can net withdraw 54,324. 
Once Enron is between 10% to 20%, then the MDWQ is 70,521... but remember 
Enron's SST is only 54,324 until October 1st... so other transport will need 
to be used to avoid overrun charges.


Why do we care about all of this....

Enron wants to slow down on the injection into storage. Because choice still 
uses storage withdrawal in April and storage withdrawal is used for 
Hopewell... there may be days that we are net withdrawing. As long as we stay 
below 54,324... there will not be penalties. If we go over this amount, we 
will need to get gas controls approval... the same drill we use for 
overinjections above 36,304.

TCO Schedulers... we have been doing a great job monitoring this so far. 
April is a very hard month to monitor storage. Remember, if we have problems 
running Storage reports from our PC's or Laptops, TCO has the ability to run 
the reports and TCO will run it on the weekends if necessary. From these 
reports, we can determine if we need to get the overwithdrawal or 
overinjection approval from TCO's Gas Control. TCO's gas control will need a 
volume amount to place in their book... which is the bible for TCO enforcing  
penalties. The penalties are pretty steep... max is $10 dkt.

Please save this note for future reference.

Dear Producers and Shippers,

 In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant 
would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.   We heard from many 
of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz 
area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed.  
Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen 
sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, 
CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until:

 1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or, 

 2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and
         processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system. 

 We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian 
Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you.  
If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson 
at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705.


        Sincerely,


        H. Dale Rexrode
        Director, Producer Services
        and Business Development

Subject:  Theoretical Storage


We need to reach an agreement on the theoretical storage as CES needs to
transfer to NPC a specific volume and price for COH, and AGL ESS, WSS and
Sonat. I had thought we had an understanding that CES would be billed, per
Melissa's memo of 3/15 and conversations during June, the percentages times
the
current month's storage capacity. We may have confused you by sending FOM
noms
for storage injections that were different than that formula, and Doug has
noticed the bills from ENA tend to represent the noms.

How should this be resolved? Should we go on ENA billed volumes or by the
formula? Let me know.
My calculations per the formula would give us the following balances for
7/31/00...
COH-4,053,906
AGL-Sonat- 504,379
AGL-ESS-9,827

No, I'm not buying.   I reviewed my credit card receipts this week and I 
bought
last.  Yawl's turn.

Don has brought me lots of checks, one for $1800 on farm equipment, $3000 from
Gerald for cows, (I think we are suppose to hold this check) and $5900 for
selling the cows.   You want me to hold this till we talk Thursday night.  I
have the checks in my Freezer on ice so they will not be hot.   I can 
continue t
hold or deposit into the account.   Your call Bub.  Also have some on Dad's 
mail
that Don dropped off.

Barb and I will be going up Friday to Alto to check out the place, mow and 
weed
eat etc.   I'll grab the mail and I have Don's check for $10,000 to Mary.   
I'll
probably go by and drop flowers on Dad's grave.

How was your trip?  Did you miss me?   You by a motorcycle YET?   I have not
really looked yet.   Sold the four wheeler to Don for $4000 plus the trailer.
I did not really need it and he asked if I wanted to sell it.

Got the insurance check from Met Life.   I signed it and put my account # on 
it
to deposit after church Sunday morning.  Stuck it and my offering check in my
wallet.  They took up the offering so I pulled out my check and put it in the
offering plate.  When I handed the offering plate to the usher, I noticed
writing on my check, then it hit me, WRONG CHECK.   Barb said my face turned
dark purple and eyes looked like watermelons.    I was stammering, wait wait,
wrong check!   Whooo, that was a close one.   Thought you might enjoy that 
one.

Hey Dow stock is an excellent buy at $24.00.   If we do not buy a scooter 
soon,
I'm going to invest a little in the Dow Stock.

Talk to you this afternoon once you are settled back in.  See Ya

Subject: January 2000 AGT volumes

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all of the Algonquin markets until Monday, 12/27.      We will
need a range from 3200 dth to 4200 dth per day.   This large swing is normal
for these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Subject: Offers For Relinquishment of Firm Capacity


To: Existing Firm Transportation Shippers

Re: Offers for Permanent Relinquishment of Firm Capacity in
Conjunction with the Momentum Expansion Project

As a part of the Momentum Expansion Project (""Momentum""),
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (""Transco"") is
soliciting offers for the permanent relinquishment of firm
transportation capacity on the Transco system from Station 65 in
Zone 3 or mainline receipt points in Zone 4 to delivery points
in Zone 4 or Zone 5 at or upstream of Station 165. Subject to
certain conditions, Transco intends to combine such relinquished
capacity with newly constructed capacity in order to render
service under Momentum. Offers for capacity relinquishment may
be made only for existing transportation services provided under
Part 284(G) of the FERC's regulations.

Valid offers must meet the following criteria:

1. The capacity offered must result in a reduction of the
facilities otherwise required to serve the subscribing
shippers under Momentum;

2. Inclusion of relinquished capacity in the project must result
in a lower cost of service for the project than if additional
facilities were constructed;

3. The remaining contract term for the relinquished capacity must
not extend beyond the 15-year primary contract term of the
Momentum service agreements;

4. Offers for permanent relinquishment will not be accepted from
shippers who nominate for service under Momentum;

5. Offers must identify the specific contract(s), MDQ, receipt
and delivery point(s) in each contract at which delivery point
entitlements (DPEs) will be reduced as a result of the
relinquishment of firm capacity to those points.  Shippers
will not be permitted to relinquish a geographic portion of
any contract; and

6. Offers must be unconditional, binding and irrevocable.

Such offers must be received by Transco no later than 5:00 PM
CST on Friday, March 30, 2001.  After receipt of offers to
relinquish capacity, Transco will finalize the design of the
facilities to be constructed to render service under Momentum.

Parties that submit offers to relinquish capacity will be
notified as to whether the offer complied with the
specifications set forth herein and whether the capacity will be
accepted and utilized to render service under Momentum.  If more
capacity is offered than is needed under Momentum, preference
will be given to those offers that reduce the cost of Momentum
to the greatest degree. In the event of a tie, preference will
next be given to those offers that have the shortest remaining
term for the capacity relinquished.

Shippers with relinquished capacity that is included in Momentum
will retain all rights and responsibilities set forth in their
Service Agreement(s), Rate Schedule FT and the General Terms and
Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff until Momentum firm
transportation service commences through the relinquished
capacity.  The relinquishing shipper's service agreements will
be terminated or reduced effective on that day. Transco's
acceptance of relinquished capacity is and will be subject to
the following:

1. Execution and delivery by the shipper to Transco of an
agreement to permanently relinquish such firm transportation
capacity (such agreement to be provided by Transco);

2. Execution and delivery of an amendment to the shipper's firm
transportation contract reflecting any modifications resulting
from the relinquishment of a portion of the service related to
such capacity, if applicable;

3. Execution and delivery of firm service agreements by shippers
subscribing to all capacity to be made available under
Momentum;

4. Shippers relinquishing capacity will file in support of
Transco's applications for a certificate of public convenience
and necessity authorizing Momentum;

5. Receipt of a FERC certificate authorizing the proposed
Momentum facilities and service (including approval of
shipper's capacity relinquishment) in a form acceptable to
Transco in its sole opinion; and

6. Placing the entire Momentum project into service.  In the
event that Momentum does not go forward for any reason,
including, without limitation, the FERC authorizations being
granted in a form unacceptable to Transco, the capacity
relinquishment shall not be effectuated and all related
agreements shall be null and void.

Parties desiring more information regarding this announcement
should contact Helen Laughlin at 713/215-3773 or Orlando
Alvarado at 713/215-3378.

OK this is metered production on CNG.

Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with.
The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES 
production.

After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal 
in Sitara with a zero volume.

If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool).  
If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me.  Metered production 
or pool gas on CNG?

Greetings,

Thanks for the TV. and Jaime also said Thanks for the bed room suite.
Chris, I found Dad's old pistol.  It was under the dresser in his bed room.
I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left.  It is
captured in a pistol storage case.  I stuck it in behind the sheets and
things.  I saw Chad and Angela on my way out.  They are a great couple.
Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work.  I am going
to get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if he
wants to lease Dad's pasture.
As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year.  You had said we do not want to
pay for a fence along the creek.  When I have leased places in the past I
have had to build new fence at my own expense.  Most folk's base their
cow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation.  If I built fence
and that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up,
then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment,
excluding my labor.  Something to think about.  I hope we do not own that
place for five more years.  Gerald also said he would mow the grass around
the house and sort of keep the place tuned up.

Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead.  They placed her in
Angleton/Danbury for overnight observation.  I think she required about
seven stitches in her head.  There were x-rays taken and her lungs are
pretty much gone.  Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech can
read his prints.

Stopped by and saw Bernie Max.  Now where did they come up with a name like
that?  They removed the lymph glands from his neck.  Starting down the torso
just at the left collar bone, a width of about three inches go down the
torso about six or seven inches.  A triangle shape about the size of a piece
of large pizza.  The incision must have been about 1.5/1.75 inches deep into
his body.  The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue.  They took a pretty
big chunk out of his chest.  He had a six "" x eight "" piece of skin removed
from his left thing for a skin graft.  It looked pretty painful.  He was in
good spirits and bull corning around.

I guess that is about it.  I would like to have a timber appraisal performed
on the Dad's place.  I'll be chatting with you guys.  Oh, I forgot the dang
remote to the TV.  I really was not for sure which one it was.  I think I
need it to program the darn thing.  Keep your powder dry.

Y'all be safe,

don

Shawna,
I am Isabel and I work in Gas Settlements.  Could you help me out with the 
following?

Deal # 233091 for Bay State is charging a demand charge every month.  
Accourding to Bay State Enron should not be charging demand charges.  Could 
you let me know if this correct.  Should Enron be charging demand charges?  
Maureen Smith is down as the trader on the deal.  However, I am not sure if 
that is correct.  Please let me know if you are not the correct person to 
send this note too.  
Thank you for your help!

Subject: Equitrans

I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans?  
Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts 
and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).  
Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe 
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.

Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my 
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with 
the end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing 
shipper is and the primary receipt and delivery points.

Thanks

Subject: Re: Meeting  

The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.  Experience has taught me that 
someone much more important may bump us.

This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.  What we bill CES for 
storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.  April is 
a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the 
same time.  CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.  The 
deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the 
withdrawals.

Which brings up the following issues;
 *   How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES 
at the storage facility.
  Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for 
storage.  How did that work?  Mark, I'm counting on you for this one.

 * How do we track the storage balance in Unify?

 * How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will 
bill on the net injections/withdrawals

I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting.

Thanks

You guys may see an opportunity for this gas sometime.  I have gas on 
National Fuel that I could deliver into CGAS at Ellwood City on a secondary 
basis.  Ellwood in Op 8, Market area 35, I think.

This trades around a CNG North plus.

Let me know one way or another, I'm just eager to learn.

Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us 
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

2000.  CES is currently receiving this gas at Beldon & Blake.

"FW:","Why Exercise???

1) My grandmother started walking five miles a day
 when she was 60.
 She's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she
 is.

 2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so
 that I could hear
 heavy breathing again.

 3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 400
 bucks. Haven't
 lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up.

 4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain
 figures out what
 I'm doing.

 5) I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch
 our toes, he
 would have put them further up our body.

 6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken
 by people who
 annoy me.

 7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach
 covers them.

 8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you
 die healthier.

 9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing,
 start with a small
 country.

 10) I don't jog. It makes the ice jump right out of
 my glass.

"Equitabel Gas Company Exchange on Tetco","CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas 
Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is 
giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new 
best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the 
January transaction is complete.

Here are my questions/comments;

1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 
146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange.  
I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC.  
If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the 
new deal.  Please let me know ASAP.

2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to 
see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment 
was due.

3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it 
above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?

4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES 
deals.  He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America.  Who 
should he talk to about that??


Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.

Thanks

Chris;
Send this bill to Raquel Magana at 600 Jefferson.  She will forward it onto 
Ronnie Shields in our Conn. office for payment.  

Ronnie;
Please have someone look at the CES purchase agreement to see how these 
should be handled.  I would assume that at a minimum, they would pay, 7/12ths 
of the bill since the deal was consummated on July 31.  There may be 
provisions where they bear all the taxes.

Subject: Taxes

I have a tax bill to Columbia Energy Services in the amount of $5,606.78 for 
gas stored at the Bear Creek Storage facility.  The amount is $5,606.78 and 
it is for the the 2000 tax year.  I was notified about this yesterday and I 
think it was due on 12/31/2000.

How do you want to handle this?  I was going to pay it and bill New Power for 
the whole amount.  I will also have our tax department fax a copy to Jeff.

Robert, please fax a copy of the letter from Jimmie Smith and the CES tax 
bill to Jeff Porter at 713-646-3499.

Thanks

Chris and all--Below is our volume request for July 7-31 for C&I customers

Please provide Kara with contract numbers in the morning.  Also, could you
please provide the pricing on this deal?  Thanks.

ENA should not be billing CES for their storage gas.  So, we should show a 
purchase from CES for the storage gas.  Of course it will get much more

reconstructed the spreadsheets.

Colleen,

I am unable to complete the Transport P&L for the Northeast Desk due to 
reconstruction on the spreadsheets where I gather my demand 
charges/reimbursements data. If you would like me to do the Transport P&L 
without that info, just let me know and I'll get that to you as soon as 
possible.

Thanks,

"CES Storage","Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.  
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.

Thanks

Subject: PSNC for April

Good Afternoon.

Just a heads up so that you may contact Chris Germany.  We have one customer 
at
PSNC.  Effective April 1st, CES will no longer be supplying gas to this
customer as their expires.  I just do not want to have a mix up for April and
have Chris contract with PSNC for capacity when none will be needed.  I am in
the process of notifing PSNC.  Just wanted to keep you in the loop and give 
you
the option to inform Chris.

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade 
behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go 
away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 
2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
 Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient

Subject: CGAS contract 64231

This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has 
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss 
this with CALP (and she may have already)
     However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he

from Mark Feldman from Volume)...


Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to 
pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to 
enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also 
think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she 
may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.  

Comments?

Chris,

I have updated the transport usage ticket reflecting the Egan volumes being 
delivered to TGT for December.
Ticket # 353094
The current Commodity Fee on the ticket is .0388.  Should this stay the same??


Thanks

Hi.

For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and
deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers.  The daily volumes I have listed
below are delivered volumes.

January 1 - January 6 = 1214 dth per day
January 7 - January 31 = 1489 dth per day


It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume 
of
the increase.  That is an estimate.  Bayer will give us a better idea at the
beginning of January.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you.

Subject: CES Daily April '00 Requirements for 4/10/00 and after


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for    and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
""Daily Change' worksheet.   Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues.

"CES moving deals","I knew we would have to address this eventually.

CES is long 3600/month in TGT Z4 at CG&E.  I showed them a $2.66 bid for 
tomorrow.  Before I had worked up the price, CES decided to take the gas into 
CGAS at Lebanon.

This gets real messy.  Is there any way we can refuse this?  At first, I was 
thinking we would have to do this.  Now, I don't like the idea because it 
will be really messy in the summer.

Subject: CES Daily March Requirements for 3/28 and after


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for
and          .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's 
date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.
The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at 
a
specific point.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Congratulations on your purchase of CES Retail.  Chris and I usually handle 
the capacity so we wanted to touch base with you before August business 
begins.
Are you keeping the CES entity for the month of August or switching to TNPC?  
If you don't switch for August, when do you expect the name change to occur?

If you stay under the CES name, business should proceed as usual.  If you 
switch, keep in mind:

For the Columbia Choice programs, the utility is required to release to the 
party responsible for billing Choice customers.  For July- Columbia Maryland, 
Columbia Virginia, and Columbia Ohio released space to CES then I would 
re-release the capacity to ENA for nomination purposes.  This would refund 
the original shipper the demand charges, then ENA would receive the transport 
charges and bill CES direct.  Do you have an entity for Columbia Gulf and 
Columbia Gas for this?  If you do, please submit paperwork for ENA to have 
agency rights.  If not, call Erin Scott at 713-267-4212 to set up your 
business party.

For Atlanta Gas Light, said they will continue to release to ENA, unless told 
otherwise.  Releases begin 7/19 for August allocations.

I will be out of the office 7/13, returning 7/21, so call Chris with any 
questions.
Scott

RE:  Iroquois' 7th Annual Customer Meeting, October 4-6, 2000
(batchmail 09.21.00)

Just a reminder that TODAY, September 21, 2000 is the cut off date for
hotel reservations at the Mystic Hilton for Iroquois' meeting.

If you haven't done so already, you can make your reservations online
at:

**  http://www.hilton.com/hotels/MYSMHHF/index.html

**  with the hotel directly at 860-572-0731

**  or with Hilton Worldwide at 1-800-HILTONS

Use the group code ""IGT"" to get the Iroquois rate of $135.  After today
we cannot guarantee room or rate availability.

Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about the the lack of rooms on
Wednesday night at the Hilton.  The golf was originally planned for
Friday afternoon but we had to move it to early Thursday morning because
of the holiday weekend, and could not get additional hotel rooms for
Wednesday night because of another conference.  There are still plenty
of rooms left for Thursday night.

If you are coming on Wednesday night, it is suggested that you make a
reservation at one of the alternate hotels in the area and ask to be
waitlisted for available rooms at the Hilton.  The alternate hotels are
listed on our website at
http://www.iroquois.com/igts/mystic/section-mystic-hotel.html  The first
four properties listed and the Residence Inn are less than a mile from
the Hilton.

While you're at it, if you haven't already RSVP'd for the meeting,
please do so by September 28.  You can register online at
http://www.iroquois.com/mystic.html.  If you have already registered
online and did not receive an e-mail acknowledgment from Lori Rauser,
please phone her at 203-944-7022 to confirm receipt.

Please contact me if you have any problems with accommodations, or any
other questions about the meeting.  We look forward to seeing you in
October.

If the deal is confirmable as a deal that came across on CES's books 
[reported as an active deal by CES to ENA], then the deal is a CES deal (CES 
- Statoil). BUT, if this is a newly discovered deal - - - - we will need to 
confirm with Risk (Mark Breese) to ensure proper booking & that the deal has 
been quantified; OR if it is a newly negotiated deal or a deal finalized 
after 1/1/00, then it should be entered without the CES prefix (statoil). 
Based on the production dates of deal# 280185 and #226563, as combine with 
the fact and that I can not find anything in the CES deal listing (CES 
'books') specifying a 333/day deal with Statoil I am again hesitant to use 
the CES prefix (nor can I confirm that deal #226563 should have been entered 
with the CES prefix.

Subject: Local Production for June

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Subject: Local Production for June

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

I just spoke with Jim Scabareti at AGL regarding the releases of capacity.  
AGL/VNG is fine with your proposal to release the assets for three years 
provided the releases are recallable for any reason.  This recall right is 
consistent with our asset management agreement (which basically determines 
the nature of recall rights AGL has under our deal)

So....

Go ahead and release the assets, 100% recallable, for three years.

Hello Chris,

Columbia of Maryland now recognizes New Power as the supplier of the old CES 
customers.  Therefore, as of today, CMD assigned a whopping one dekatherm on 
Gulf and TCo to New Power, instead of to ENA, from Rayne to CMD city gate.

I executed the agreements and will release them to you assuming that it's 
okay to do so when I get the chance tomorrow.  I'd like to keep all of the 
capacity that ENA is managing together.  Let me you if you have any problems 
with that.

Singer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Re: storage clarification & issues  

Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2:  The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month 
changes does appear to be an issue.  Since the contract didn't spell out in 
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we 
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly 
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location.  I know Chris 
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not 
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie.  I will ask that he forward 
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP.  Let me know if 
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3.  Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms 
here.   Here is what is happening:  Your people are nominating this 
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations), 
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction.  That 
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.   We are 
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between 
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual 
contract prices with the producers.  So, this is one issue we will have to 
address as indemnification items.  That's problem one.  Problem two is that I 
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all 
the nominations.  We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is 
what you want).  For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the 
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from 
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.   I'll 
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4.  Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like 
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the 
pipeline invoices on to you.  Maybe we should change this process to one 
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his 
confirmation and review of all the charges.  This means you may see quite a 
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something.  Let us know what 
you would prefer.  Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that 
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to 
your office yesterday, March 29.  Chris will get all remaining demand charge 
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is 
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7.  I apologize for the delay.

5.  Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a 
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on 
Monday.  Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you?  If not, please 
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory 
balances.

Subject: storage clarification & issues

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 
2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
 Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

issue.  She can be reached at (703) 317-2293.  Can you please get back to me 
as soon as possible as they would like to resolve.

Thanks
Laurie

No, I still haven't gotten anywhere on this.  My contact at Amereda Hess 
(formerly Statoil) is John Bieltz.  His number is 703-317-2318 and his email

I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my 
knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at 
Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we 
were not aware of.

Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG 
Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient 
awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria 
Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.

"Lunch with Tenn","James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday.  I 
don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either.  

He is going to educate us on the VNG contract #47.  The demand charge and 
commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000.  This is what we know about the 
contract:

MDQ = 16,373 eff 11/1/2000
The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted  commodity of $.05 and 
discounted demand of $6.08
If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61

What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for 
volumes over 4723 day.
What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day  for November - 
 is it 141,690 (4723 x 30) @ $6.08 and 38,310 ([6000-4723] x 30) @ $7.61.

Mr. Germany,

How are things going?  You still pursuing JD's girl?  How's Corey doing?
Did you ever move into the bigger one-bedrooms at Bayou Park?  I hope so --
those studio apartments are too small.  How's Ingrid? doing?

As for myself, I have never been so busy in my life -- papers, group
projects, tests, etc.  I rarely have time to go out, and that really sucks
because the undergraduate women around here are just spectacular.  Granted,
they tend to be a bit bitchy (being rich daddy's girls and all), but they're
very easy on the eyes.  Anyway, if the trend continues, I doubt if I'll be
getting laid much during my two years at Vandy -- too many damn papers to
write!

Let me know how things are going.  I just got an e-mail from Jim; I think
I'll just be starting module 2 around Nov. 4, so I'll see if I can make it
down there.

In the meantime, my address here in Nashville is:

401 Village at Vanderbilt
Nashville, TN  37212
615/ 321-9648

Keep in touch,

Chad

Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a

for that.

so the contract type, rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the

Also, there are 10 contracts that we were invoiced for processing charges

I was inherited from CES.  CES had originally made the sale and when we 
bought their book of business, we ended up with that sale.  You may want to 
speak with Chris Germany about it, he was very involved with the CES 
assimilation.

Thanks for the info!  Do you know what the key is to make sure the tickets 
show up in Unify on the right desk?  Also how do we assure flash is on right 
desk or is this not going to be an issue if we are using the Service P & l to 
flash?  If we use the Service P & L to flash, will the transport info in 
Unify and the flash amts. be the same and on the same desk?  How this makes 
sense!

Subject: Capacity Deal tickets

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up 
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, 
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.  
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes 
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same 
contract under both desk.

Subject: NYPA

Unofficially, according to Transco, NYPA has 4 receipt points on their FT-NT 
contract.  Transco gave me the receipt volumes in MCF's and I used a 1.035 
Btu factor.  I can't 

Point  Volume MCF  dts 
Henry  12,336   12,768
Mamou  7,849   8,124
Carthage 4,934   5,107
Ada  7,401   7,660  (at the east end on the north LA lateral leg in TGT Zone 
1) 

   Total  33,659

My numbers must be off a little somewhere because NYPA's MDQ is 30,840 dts, 
grossed up for fuel of 7.62%, the receipt volume is 33,384 dts.  To my 
knowledge, we have never used ADA (which I know nothing about) or Carthage.

Currently we are giving NYPA half their volume at Mamou (off TGT) and half at 
Henry.  At the very least we should be able to switch these volumes around to 
better suit our needs.

Please note, I have not mentioned any of this to Stacey at NYPA.  The only 
information Stacey was able to provide was her delivered MDQ and her grossed 
up receipt volume.  She relies on us to tell her how much gas she is getting 
at each point.

Chris,

   Columbia Marketing has some outstanding invoices from Jan - Mar of this 
year
for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked 
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you have
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

   PS  Credit tells me that the Jan Gulf invoice is outstanding, also.

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

it was right below all my notes on CanFibre.  The customer is Latrove Steel.  
I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works.  Does anyone object 
to that?  I will wait until this afternoon before I call.

Heidi
Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If 
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we 
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples  

Questions that I have:
1)  I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool.  It 
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the 
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these 
types of noms.)  This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas 
behind the gate and we don't need more production.  If the customer can't 
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will 
only make my pool longer.

2)  If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest 
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3)  Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount 
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?  

4)  If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be 
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with 
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples  

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction 
from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until 
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the 
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There 
are 7 Phillips meters  in CES's pool beginning July 2000.  Heidi Boyd @ CES 
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool 
until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in 
their pool beginning July 2000.

2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.  


Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the 
system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force 
Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd 
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
  Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will 
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for
and          .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's 
date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.
The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at 
a
specific point.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Just in case you did not know, Randy's wife died last week. They will be 
having services today and tomorrow.  However, in lieu of flowers they would 
like donations for a playground in their neighborhood.  If you want to give a 
donation, please bring it by my desk.


Thanks
Kimberly

"New Counterparty","I have more info on this deal - according to Colleen Sullivan, this is a CES 
Retail fuel management deal.  ENA has the right to use the capacity and does 
all the nominations on the CALP contract.  I still need the counterpart set 
up.  Thanks

Victor,  for January, I have set this up as and exchange deal (deals 149775 & 
149776).  We may need to create 2 delivery exchange deals for constrained and 
unconstrained citygates.

Scott, this is the deal we spoke about this morning.  For January, we will 
treat this as an exchange.  We need to chat about Feb and March.

Subject: Re: Oglethorpe

Hey gang.  Attached is the maualy invoice for Oglethorpe.  I have fixed the 
pricing and the volumes on the top part of deal 516907 to match the maual 
invoice.  Can we adjust the expected volumes in Sitara to match the manual 
invoice?  If yes, how do you balance Unify since these are deal volumes and 
not actual flow volumes.

AND Sherri, how this be entered from the accounting side in Unify, since 
scheduling vs actual flow vs billing are all different?

I also included the scheduling fee of $10,000.00.  David and I discussed this.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Mr. Westover, there should be no manual billing for the month of September, 
everything should be billed through the system.

Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day 


Computer Gender 

An English teacher was explaining to the students 
the 
concept of gender 
association in the English language; noting how 
hurricanes at one time were 
given only female names, and how ships and planes 
were 
usually referred to 
as ""she."" One of the students raised her hand and 
asked, 
""What gender is a 
computer?"" 

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class 
into two 
groups:? males 
in one, females in the other, and asked them to 
decide if 
a computer should 
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked 
to give 
four reasons for 
their recommendations. 

??? The group of women concluded that computers 
should be 
referred to as 
masculine because: 

1. In order to get their attention, you have to 
turn them 
on. 

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless. 

3. They are supposed to help you solve your 
problems, but 
half the time, 
they ARE the problem. 

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, 
if you 
had waited a 
little longer, you could have had a better model. 

??? The men, on the other hand, decided that 
computers 
should definitely be 
referred to as feminine because: 

1. No one but their creator understands their 
internal 
logic. 

2. The native language they use to communicate 
with other 
computers is 
incomprehensible to everyone else. 

3.? Even your smallest mistakes are stored in 
long-term 
memory for later 
retrieval. 

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you 
find 
yourself spending half 
your paycheck on accessories for it.

Phillips Production has/had two seperate PNG deals:
 1.  500 MCFD; $2.82/MCF; 1/1/00 - 6/30/00
 2.  300 MCFD;  $2.95/MCF;  1/1/00 - 11/30/00
To my knowledge, PNG does not send out production information to either the 
producer or the pool operator.  This information should be available on 
E-Script.
 Phillips gets their production volumes (which they use to create our 
invoice) from the company integrating the meter charts.  I beleive that this 
is the same information provide to PNG.

Subject: Re: Phillips Production Co - PNG City Gate Production  

Wade,  Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. But I need help 
understanding this one.  We have a process already to handle John's behind 
the citygate deals  

Since, the actual scheduling is done by CES in Virginia,  we never nominate 
this gas nor do we see actuals.  We hear about them from John and Terry and 
we are supposed to get confirms from the producer and CES.  Whenever one of 
these deals occurs, we have buys from the producer and sales to CES to 
account for these transactions internally.

It's my understanding that whenever John cuts one of these behind the 
citygate deals;  that Terry puts it into Sitara for him.  The offset also 
entered by Terry  is a sale to CES (Now the New Power Company effective Sept. 
1) with commercial (usually Chris Germany) confirming the sale price.  Angie 
schedules it in Unify under CNG and we create, track and balance like usual. 

Is that not the case here?  Is this something that's getting reconciled in 
Jeanne and Terry's project for CNG???

By cc: Angie, please get with Terry /Jeanne and Chris to help Wade.  THANKS!  
Please keep me abreast of the status.

Subject: Phillips Production Co - PNG City Gate Production

ENA is being invoiced by Phillips Production Company for production on  
Dominion Transmission (CNG) via Peoples Natural Gas.  This is 
behind-city-gate gas that we do not get documents supporting the volumes. I 
have invoices and production statements from Phillips.  

Per John Singer Notes Mail of 08/23 concerning the July production,"" Phillips 
Production / Peoples: Price:  @ $2.95/Mcf  Term:  1/1/2000 - 11/30/2000 Est. 
Volume:  500/MCFD  (Actual Volume will vary.)   I have no way of verifying 
the actual volume.  Chris Germany and Angie Zeman will try to get into CES's  
PNG pool via E-Script.  This may be the only way to verify actual volumes.  I 
have a call into Phillips to see if they might have a pipeline statement 
verifying volumes.""  Joihn's call to Phillips read partially,  "" I just 
talked to Sam Fragale @ Phillips.  The 7,843 Mcf @ $2.95 is ENA's. ""

Our deals have been using point 20200 on Dominion Transmission (CNG).  Deals 
for Jan 00 - Mar 00 were 210359 and 210364.  These were copied to 226543 and 
229733 respectively for April 00 forward  Deal 226543 has April 00 only, but 
should probably be extended through June-00 according to deal notes from John.
Here is our current status on this gas

Prod  Invoice  Invoice  Current  
Month  Volume  Price  Unify Vol Sitara Deal 

May-00  4801  @$2.82  163  226543 (has April-00 only, should extend through 
June?))
  9748  @$2.95  353  229733

June-00  5341  @$2.82  0  226543 (has April-00 only, should extend through 
June?))
  9394  @$2.95  0  229733

July-00  7843  @$2.95  9552  229733

We need to get our proccess together for handling this each month through the 
end of the deal terms.

Please direct the appropriate parties to help make these invoiced volumes 
available on the deal and in Unify so I can pay Phillips.

Thanks  WRP

Here is what I know.  We started pulling 430 MCF (443 dth) from pool N424PB 
effective 7-1-00 which was changed to 430 dth effective 7-18-00.  I'm 
assuming pool N424PB is the CES/ENA non-priority pool.  Let me know if we 
need to do anything different on our side.

Subject: Re: PNG Local Production July 00  

Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day 
from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.  

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 
for the month.  

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will 
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has 
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat 
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure 
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not 
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's 
brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas. 

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.  
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly 
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

Subject: PNG Local Production July 00


Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES

My only comment to this is to please make sure the contracts have IMNE and 
IMME as desks since most of them will be market area deliveries.  They are
already in Unify and the multiple desks may be all we need to path them.  The 
Transco schedulers are also going to have to know the receipt and delivery
points that are primary for all these contracts with Transco changes among 
other things.

As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity

the master contracts in our system until after the 1st.  However, we will 
need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in 
Sitara.  Following is a list of master contracts and the associated demand

Mark, David;
Enron Corp is expecting 590,609.20 ($463,609.20 + $127,000.00) from ECT.  
Scott Neal wants to see what impact, if any, this will have on the East Desk 
P&L.  I'm hoping we didn't show any of this as East Desk revenue.

Summary
Earlier this year, ECT received a credit from Transco in the amount of 
$463,609.20.  This credit was the result of reallocations on Enron 
Louisiana's PVR replacement contract for 9612 and 9701 production months.  
ECT nominated the replacement gas and paid all transport expense associated 
with this contract.  Scott Neal has agreed to pass this money on to 
corporate.  The net effect to ECT is $0.00.  Enron Corp is also expecting 
$127,000.00.  This is for a similar adjustment ECT received in 1997 that was 
written off on 1998 (see below).  The actual amount for the 1997 adjustment 
is $121,080.16.  

Enron Corp has had a $600,000.00 receivable (from Transcanada) on their books 
since Enron Louisiana was sold to Transcanada.  Enron Corp and Transcanada 
thought Transco was going to send the credits to Transcanada instead of ECT.

Chris,

In order for the I/C imbalance between ECT and ELEC be resolved by August 
month-end close,  a wire or check made payable to Co.366 needs to be prepared 
by the end of this week.  

Please advise me the amount that needs to be made so that I can prepare a 
manual wire/check this week.  I'll contact Inez Haberl regarding the payee's 
bank information.

Thanks,

The offsetting dollar amount for the 9612 production adjustment 
(K#016-21045-306C) was $121,080.16.  This adjustment however was reversed 
from Enron Louisiana's account and reclassed to Enron Liquid Services in 
11/97 GL and subsequently written off in 01/98 GL at the time the company was 
sold.  I do have a copy of the write off entry at my desk should you need it.

I've discussed with Darron regarding the difference between the amount we are 
going to make to Co.366 ($463,609.20) and the actual dollars in the system 
($498,824.82).  He thought it would be better for audit trail purpose to 
write off this difference since the volume in the system is correct.  

Chris, please let me know when to prepare the wire/check to Co.366 and what 
the amount would be.  Thanks,

Vivien

The 9612 production adjustment received from Transco was a reduction in 
volume of (33,517).  There was a ($2,734.99) Commodity adjustment and a 
($124,582.69) Cash Out adjustment for a total credit from Transco of 
($127,317.68).  ECT took this credit.  This volume adjustment was entered in 
the sales system in 10/97 reducing the sales volume to Enron Louisiana from 
284,890 to 251,373 on K#016-21045-306C.  I don't know what the offsetting 
dollar amount would be for the sales adjustment but someone in Client 
Services should be able to get this info.

Subject: Enron Louisiana Mtg. 8/3

I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday.  Tracy is expecting 
to receive about $590,000.00, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's 
meeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed  in mid to late 1997.

Melba told me this morning that  the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production 
month adjustment.  What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to 
Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2)  pass it through to 
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3) 
cut a check to Trans Canada?  Who do I talk to about this?

Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366.  
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez.  
Her extension is 3-7720.

Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait 
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00?  I believe it depends on 
how long it will take to research the $127,000.00.

Comments, Questions?

Subject: TCo and Gulf Capacity for April 2001

Chris,

As you and I both know and discussed, New Power will manage what used to be 
the old CES TCo and Gulf capacity starting in April, 2001.  We have talked to 
the CDC's (COH, CPA, CMD, & CVA) have worked out the following with them:

CMD & CVA
CMD and CVA will recall all of the CES capacity on Gulf and TCo from you.  
They will subsequently re-release it to New Power effective April 1, 2001.  
New Power will execute it at that time.  This should happen late this week or 
early next week.

CPA
CPA will not recall it form ENA and re-release to New Power.  Can you 
permanently release all of that capacity at max rates to New Power as soon as 
possible effective April, 2001?

COH
For COH, the biggest pieces of capacity on TCo are FSS storage and 
corresponding SST contracts.  They both expire in March 2001.  Therefore 
nothing is required of ENA in terms of releasing them to New Power.

There is a contract with an mdq of 1,000/day primary from Leach to COH 8-35 
Pittsburgh (K#:  67694) that should be permanently released to New Power at 
max rates effective April, 2001.  

There are, I believe, about seven contracts (K#'s:  68918, 68915, 69148, 
69693, 68916, 68917, 69149) with primary receipt point(s) in the Toledo agg 
area.  The primary delivery points are 5-2 Parma, 5-7 Sandusky, and 7-4 
Alliance.  These contracts need to be permanently released to New Power at 
the following rates:
 68918 - $5.171
 68915 - $5.171
 69148 - $5.171
 69693 - $5.171
 68916 - $5.181
 68917 - $5.181
 69149 - $5.181

Let me know that this okay.

still need to sell Sep and Oct to someone.

I noticed the volume for July in Power Gas Marketing is 0, so I entered an 
expected volume of 0 on the EES deal.  I didn't want to mess anything up so 
close to nom time.  Please put 10,000 for the month on both deals for July.

Thanks.


Peoples
I changed the volume on deal 264595 to 3500 for the month.  This volume 
fluctuates each month and John Singer will tell us the actual volume.  This 
deal also goes through October.

We are buying local production from Phillips Production Company.  I did not 
see a deal in the system for August so I created 348434, the price needs to 
be corrected.  This deal goes through November.  The estimated volume for 
August is 300 per day, this volume also fluctuates each month..

We are selling all gas behind Peoples to Clinton, deal 348443.  The price on 
this deal is CNG IF per mcf.  Clinton will pay us based on actuals.

From the Birmingham Sunday Mercury (7th Jan 2001)
  Worker dead at desk for 5 days

  Bosses of a publishing  firm are trying to work out why no one
  noticed that one of their employees had been sitting dead at
  his desk for FIVE DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling
  okay.  George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a
  proof-reader at a New York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack
  in the open-plan office he shared with 23 other workers.  He
  quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody noticed until
  Saturday morning when an office cleaner  asked why he was
  still working during the weekend.  His boss Elliot Wachiaski
  said ""George was always the first guy in each morning and the
  last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that he was in
  the same position all that time and didn't say anything.  He was
  always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself.  ""A post
  mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five
  days after suffering a coronary.  Ironically, George was
  proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.

  You may want to give your co-workers a nudge or kick
  occasionally.

I have been speaking with Sylvia Campos on this.  Originally they wanted to 
do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then 
they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a 
different service type (so as not to change historically).  To my 
recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was 
cleared with Connie Sutton.  So this reversal does somewhat surprise me.

Richard, according to Marlene, she needs to put in an IT request to change 
the National Fuel contracts from non-pathed to pathed.  Does this sound 
correct to you?

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type.  Our Unify 
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting 
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like 
we did Southern Natural.  And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in 
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type 
manner.  We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production 
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the 
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't 
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the 
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream 
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify.  The pipe told me this is 
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area.  If it is 
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter 
the data twice today.  If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's 
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

    Our model type is always ""P"" for pathed.

Vince and Vasant:

Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at 
the East Desk, related to gas transmission:

Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example 
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay 
$12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed 
payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs (""shrinkage"") and 6.5% for 
overhead expenses.  A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a 
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 (""basis""), and might call Brooklyn 
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .  The trader's spread is 
$0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would 
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.  
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have 
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity. 
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum 
(""it's not worth their time to haggle"") (There is a further issue of 
""secondary markets"" not important to the model yet).  For South Texas and 
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take 
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).  And, once the trade is in the 
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline, 
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

Clayton

Hi!  Remember last month changing the rate in sitara so the
discounts could be taken....well, I need it done for 12/99 now.
The total volumes for CNG/Sabine for 12/99 are
7,676,198 and we should be paying $13,298.60 for at rate of .00172794.
Let me know if you need more information, or copies, or whatever.  And
does emailing this work ok, or what would work best to update this every
month?  Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria.  How are you?

"Re: CGE transfer to TCO Pool","CES has decided to take 600 dth/day of their Texas Gas Zone 4 length into 
CGAS at Lebanon for the 24th-29th.  To keep the deal tickets simple, I am 
showing a purchase from CES at Lebanon for 600 dth/day at the first of the 
month CGAS price. 

Joe, I created a purchase from CES (deal 202576).  Match this up with 600dth 
of deal 159319.

We will effectively be using 600 dth less of Dayton space for CES starting on 
the 24th.

I will let you know if things change.

Please let me know if there are any questions or problems.

The net impact is $0 because I'm also showing this as a reimbursement.  How

"Hi","Here is what I have so far.   One of the floor tech's I chat with is Ishi 
Carter.  His number is 713-853-5580.

I learned some things today.  Ishi said Enron hires techies through 2 
companies New Boston Technologies (713-626-4900) and Comsys (713-547-0700).  
Techies work for these companies for 6 months and then Enron may or may not 
make them an offer.

Ishi said it would be ok for you to call him.

But, I'm thinking I should at least know your name first.  

Also, we have a ton of other IT type people in the company I'm going to chat 
with.

I get you more scoop later.

Chris,

How the hell are you?

Hope all is well.

I was wondering if you could forward to me a list of all of the pipeline 
capacity and storage assets that you have on behalf of CES.  I am in the 
process of setting up New Power on the respective pipes.

Credit is an issue.  To better know how much credit NPC needs, I thought it 
would be good to see how much FT CES gets on each pipe.
  
Do you maintain a spreadsheet similar to the one you used to maintain for 
EES' assets?

Can you tell what I have?  Make sense?

Thanks.
Mike

               It's a Party and You're Invited

     I'm heading up north and didn't want to leave without having one

bbq.  I will have some snacks along with the bbq, but any side dishes or
desserts will definitely be enjoyed by one and all.

     Please bring your own ""Cheer"".

     Also, I need a head count for how much bbq to buy. (Get your minds
out of the gutter.) So, please let me know if you're attending.

Subject: CES Storage

Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.  
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.

Thanks

Subject: CES FOM August 2000 Volume request


The attached file contains CES's first-of-the-month daily volume requirements
for August 2000.  This request is submitted 3 business days prior to NYMEX
close for the month of August.   The file contains volumes to be delivered to
the citygate as well as volumes to be injected into storage consistent with 
the
theoretical storage injection schedule.


Please note that for the month of August '00 CES is not purchasing additional
volumes of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate 
deal,
as was done in June and July.   Also, CES is not ordering any volumes in 
August
for Honeywell (formerly Allied Signal) which ceased to be a CES customer at 
the
end of March 2000.


Please call me if you have questions or problems with the attached request.

released capacity to Sithe (only 500 dth per day), and acted as billing and 
nominating agent on this contract.  It was a citygate sale  in New York and 
we wanted to transfer title at the pool.

I received a call from Scott Nelson (212-351-0494) with Sithe this morning.  
He is terminating the agency.

Subject: CES Retail capacity

Per our discussion on Monday, we need to give CES-Retail a bid for the two 
TCO transportation contracts that were dedicated to c&i customers that they 
will no longer need once they sell their c&i business effective 6/1/00.  As 
you recall, one contract is to COH for 20,000/d through 10/31/00 (#65402); 
the other is to BG&E  for 19,000/d through 4/01(#65403).  This is the 
information that Jeff Porter and Charlie gave to me--you need to confirm that 
this information is accurate.

I am going to call Charlie back tomorrow morning (Friday, 5/12) and suggest 
that he talk to one of you two directly for a bid on the agreements.  I think 
this will be more efficient (and put the pressure on you to price it 
up!!).    If there is any problem with this, please let me know.

Colleen,

As I understand it, we were acting as Agent for TCO capacity owned by Titanium
Metals, and that capacity was incorrectly incorporated into the sale of our
Wholesale book.  Could you please look into this on your end and let me know
how to best proceed with correcting this situation.

As I understand it, we were acting as Agent for TCO capacity owned by Titanium
Metals, and that capacity was incorrectly incorporated into the sale of our
Wholesale book.  Could you please look into this on your end and let me know
how to best proceed with correcting this situation.

Thanks,

Melissa (703-561-6408)

The invoiced rate on this contract is for  interruptible gathering but the 
information on the deal reflects a Firm contract. How do you suggest handling 
so the contract type, rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the 
pipeline?

Also, there are 10 contracts that we were invoiced for processing charges 
that are not on the Service List in Path Manager for Feb.
Are you working on getting contracts and deals added?

Thanks,
Brenda

One correction:  It is our understanding that we will nominate this contract 
until March 2000, not until the fuel management responsibilities expire in 
2002, unless we are successful in negotiating an extension of the ENA/CES 
Retail alliance beyond March 2000.

Subject: International Paper/Union Camp - PLEASE READ

To ensure everyone is on the same page. International Paper/Union Camp 
contract expires with CES Retail to perform the Fuel Management Duties in 
2002. Fred Lombardo has been handling the fuel management responsibilities 
from Pittsburgh and will leave CES at the end of February. CES is outsourcing 
these management responsibilities to Alliance Energy Services. CES has a term 
supply contract with Enron for 6900 delivered to Union Camp and this expires 
at the end of March 2000. CES is in agreement that Enron will continue to 
nominate this gas until the end of March 2000.

The Contract signed between CES and Enron, states that ENA has the agency 
rights for the International Paper Contract. 

Enron's understanding is that Enron will continue to nominate this contract 
until CES's fuel management responsibilities expire in 2002. Colleen and 
Melissa, please ensure both companies are on the same page. Fred Lomabardo 
and his boss, Don Deal, were going to outsource the nomination rights of this 
contract to Alliance Energy. This is not allowed per the Contract language.

In addition, Union Camp does not want to sign the agency agreement required 
by TCO, because it is vague. Enron needs this agreement signed so we can 
nominate the gas under Enron's accounts on TCO. We need CES's help in getting 
this matter resolved ASAP.

Thanks

"Continuation of Assignment of Capacity","Hey.  What is your professional opinion about this?  This was sent to me by 
my scheduler.  I assume this just means that if you don't have primary NIMO 
capacity on CNG, NIMO will continue to assign CNG capacity to you each 
month.  True?


March 10, 2000


SENT VIA FAX, E-MAIL & WEBSITE

NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION:


In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk
will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas
rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment.

If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk
last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara
Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity 
to
you.  However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an
Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG
capacity to you.   The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March,
2000.  Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of 
April.

If you have any questions, please call Dennis Bartlett at 315-460-4042 or me 
at
315-460-4041.  Thank you.

Chris, I have researched the buy and sell from/to AEC Marketing for 4/2000.  
Here are the details:

Location:  7126-NFUL/TRCO LEIDY TRANSCO

  transport demand charge(4/2000)    = $56,078.82


Deal   227196 purchase 9189/day @ NX1 + .22 (3.12)    

Deal  219618 sell              6000/day @ Michcon Citygate G.D. M.I. + 
.39(3.39) 

It seems as though ENA is recouping the demand charge only on 6,000 mmbtu per 
day.  Do you know if the additional reimbursement has been locked in?  
Perhaps on the financial side?

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since

with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he

from Mark Feldman from Volume)...


Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport 
capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on?

PNG and EOH have their own EBBs but they use the same Escript software.
You have to log in through PNGaltra and EOHaltra once you click into Escript.
If you don't see them they probably aren't installed.
If not maybe you could walk me through how to do it?

Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300
day from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be
4,000 for the month.

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to
Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool
gas.

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates
it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do
it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was
not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out
there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I
will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is
the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES

Could you please send the service agreement into Koch for the Ormet 
transaction.  This memo that I wrote to Scott details the rates that we have 
negotiated with Koch.  Koch has to post our deal for five days, so could you 
please try to send it out today if at all possible.  I am also sending you 
the draft letter agreement that Koch sent to us which we will also need to 
execute.  We will also need to put an IT agreement in place with Koch.  They 
have offered the same discounted rates on an IT basis for any volumes above 
the 15,000/d of FT.

Also, could you please arrange to put in place an IT agreement on Cypress for 
delivery to Ormet Aluminum's Burnside,LA

Thanks for your help.

Scott:

Ormet's Burnside,LA Aluminum refinery is dually connected to Koch and Cypress.
The transport rates that  Koch has quoted for FT to Ormet are as follows:

From Bridgeline/Paradis or LRC/ Paradis .03 demand charge

from Venice     .05 demand charge

from the Mobile Bay pooling point on Koch .045 demand charge
(if we buy upstream of the pooling point then we would also pay a .0246 
gathering fee on Mobile Bay)

In addition we will be charged .0022 ACA from any of these receipt points.

The fuel rate is 1.6%.  This will be passed on to Ormet.

Koch has agreed that any volumes in excess of the 15/d of FT will be at the 
same discounted rate, but will flow on an IT basis.  If this IT is cut, we 
still must use best efforts to transport from other receipt points on Koch or 
on Cypress.  Ormet pays all additional transport costs.
Additionally, we have a price re-opener if Koch changes from monthly 
balancing at any point during the contract term.
I am working with Koch to get secondary delivery points on Koch in the event 
that the desk wants to take the gas elsewhere (i.e. if Ormet doesn't need the 
gas or if you choose to deliver off of Cypress).  If you have any preferences 
for alternate delivery points, please let me know.

As I mentioned, we  have already quoted NYMEX + .055 as the all-in delivered 
price to Ormet.

Ormet would like to come to agreement on this transaction today (his wife is 
due any day so he will be out of the office starting tomorrow).  They are one 
hour ahead of us so your comments are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for all of your help on this deal.

Craig

Subject: AGL supply strategy for Remainder of Feb'00



Chris--At this date, CES has a large overhang of storage inventory on AGL.
To address this situation, I have asked David Scott to increase our IBSS
withdrawals to the maximum daily withdrawal quantities for the rest of
February.   Moreover, we also want to maximize our daily withdrawals on the
directly assigned storage services for the rest February.    We don't want gas
injected into storage unless it is necessary to avoid a penalty.   David will
contact Scott about the Directly Assigned storage withdrawals.

To the extent that maximizing our storage withdrawals requires us to cut back
on flowing gas, the cuts in flowing gas will be sold back to ENA  per our
contract.


Please call me if you have questions, etc.

Thanks.

p.m. to turn in a contract # for their noms.   They are quoting their tariff 
as
we have never turned our contract number in to them on time.    I need a
contract number for Tennesse and AGT for Yankee.   It is urgent.

Subject: market exits


Chris,

As I indicated on our call about a week ago, CES Retail is attempting to exit 
a
number of current markets for Major Accounts business only.  The list that
we're contemplating includes CKY, CG&E, DP&L, East Ohio, Indiana Gas, Western
Kentucky, CVA, COH, and BGE.  Again, for those LDCs where we participate in
Choice programs, we will continue to serve those customers.

We are trying to have this accomplished prior to March flow so that we can 
take
March 2000 forward out of our physical requirements from Enron.

I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available.

Thanks,

Melissa

Well, the time has finally arrived............after purchasing some bean bag 
and inflatable 'Southpark' chairs, I'm officially ready for a party.  Won't 
you please come  over and share in a few cocktails.   This Saturday, March 31 
at 7:30,  1314 Utah St.  (corner of Truro and Utah, near Memorial Park)   I 
will have beverages and snacks, but as in the past, no jello shots or Busch 
beer.  (sorry Matt and Mike)

Most of you aren't aware of where I live, but parking could be a problem. 
(sorry, no valet)   In the 'hood', people tend to park wherever they can, 
this being along all the streets surrounding the house as well as the 
volleyball courts at Bubbas.  Park wherever you can.

Please see the attached map or go to Yahoo Maps for assistance.  It works 
well if you use 1380 Utah St.  (Don't ask why)    Please pass this on to 
others that I may have overlooked.  Call if you have any questions.

Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us 
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

Subject: VNG Tennessee Transport

Dan and I spoke with Jim Eckert at Tenn - VNG is his customer.  Following are 
the MDQ's and rates on the Tennessee contracts effective 11/1/2000


Contract MDQ  Delivery Point Demand Comm  Comment
47  16,373  S Webster $6.0800  $.0500  Demand is $6.08 for daily volumes 
below 4,723 per day. 
          Demand goes to $7.61 for daily volumes above 4,723 per day.

21881  4,599  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below

21882  518  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below


Comments:
If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand 
charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.  

Questions for Tennessee;
What are the rates for October?
Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or 
monthly quantities?

Subject: New SST Volumes for COH



Just a note that as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

"Re: Questions","Responses:
1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.

2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would 
like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes 
through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas 
on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we 
are buying back gas at GD - $.01.

3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill 
CES directly for this?  

4.  See attached worksheets.

5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The 
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing 
using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.  
Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she 
will recreate Jan - Mar.

6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about 
the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about 
total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take 
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and 
you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as 
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a 
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something 
specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take 
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has 
discussed this with Melissa.

Subject: Questions


Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.

1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
the
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
plus
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.

2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes 
for
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required 
to
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
with
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.

3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since 
the
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous ""buy/sell""  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.

4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please 
provide
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
basis
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)

5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?

6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?


There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they
arise.

Thanks.

Subject: New and Exciting National Fuel Deal


We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons.

Subject: Transport formula settles

Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the 
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as 
possible.  This means using as few ""formula based"" curves as possible and as 
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.  I'm not sure how you or 
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but 
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating 
transport p&l.  In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are 
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.  These could 
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates.  The 
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index 
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue 
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES 
business in our portfolio, the times have changed.  Currently we are using 
""formula based"" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport 
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and 
how we are marking the curves.  For example, today's Gas Daily postings 
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985   $1.565     $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39   $  .585     $.16
CNG South $3.305   $  .670     $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.  There are 
two solutions that I see.  One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which 
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other 
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more 
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.  That's up to you.  
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads 
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know 
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it), 
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work 
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

Colleen,

Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling 
daily:

CNG North City Gate = GD CNG North +.16
CNG South City Gate = Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their 
intra-month curve at.
TECO Citygate = GD CGT/App +.10

Please note that CNG North City and TECO City settle prices come in at a one 
day lag.  After we receive gas daily settles, we reload prices for any 
derived curves.

"Oglethorpe Power","Effective immediately we are changing the way we handle deliveries to 
Oglethorpe on Transco.

Current Process
ENA sales gas to Oglethorpe at St 85
ENA buys gas from EPMI (deal 318335) at St 85 at Gas Daily
ENA sells gas back to EPMI at Doyle Plant at Gas Daily plus variable cost.

New Process
ENA sells gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 (deal 329314, baseload deal  and deal 
318423, gas daily deal)
ENA does an exchange buy (deal 338732) at St 85.  Curretly, this volume will 
match the sale to Oglethorpe at St 85
ENA does an exchange sell (deal 338735), volume on this deal will be the 
amount on deal 338732 less Z4 to Z4 fuel.

"New and Exciting National Fuel Deal","We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons.

Spoke to Mary last night.  She's doing well and I know you both care.  She
said Bernie Max was in surgery for 4 hours on Friday to have a melanoma
spot removed from his collar bone - not good.  She found out about it
indirectly somehow.  Gerald and Shirley didn't know about the surgery
either.

I should have an update on our legal issues by the end of the day.

I just spoke with ""Wendy"" in the Cherokee County Appraisal District.  She
said all of Dad's property was transferred to us back in August of 2000.  I
told her that seemed odd since the property was still in probate.  She said
that there was a special warranty deed transferring the property to us and
that Mary Esquivel had agreed to transfer the property.  Don't know how
that happened and don't care.  She also said that we need to fill out the
ag expemtion on both pieces of property.  The one I have is for the 31
acres.  Don, she will mail the other application to you at P.O. Box 532,
Brazoria  77422.  She will also mail a copy of the last application Dad
filled out.  We need to get the completed applications back to them in May
(does not have to be May 1).

Subject: CPR reports

Terry, 

Unless I'm missing something, it does not appear that there is a way for us 
to run a CPR report that shows all business done on a particular pipe 
regardless of desks.  For example, if I want to see all business that is 
being done on Transco, I must run the report for both the Northeast desk and 
the Market East desk.  This next weekend, the east is to be split into 12 
different desks, which will only complicate the issue even more.  

Russ Severson has the position screen set so that all business will roll into 
one position manager.  Is there any way that we get something similar from 
the reporting environment.  I'm thinking that the easiest way might be to 
have the ability to select just a pipe without being forced to select a desk 
first when submitting a report.  

Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Thanks!

Kathy

Subject: Re: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type  

 What do I need to do?  Should I end the exitsting contracts effective 
4/30/00 and create new ones effective 5/1/00?  Does Marlene need to create a 
new type of FT rate service to make these contracts appear different ( maybe 
that has already been done)?

I was not aware ot the Sonat Style.  In that case, an IT request is not 
necessary.

I have been speaking with Sylvia Campos on this.  Originally they wanted to 
do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then 
they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a 
different service type (so as not to change historically).  To my 
recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was 
cleared with Connie Sutton.  So this reversal does somewhat surprise me.

Richard, according to Marlene, she needs to put in an IT request to change 
the National Fuel contracts from non-pathed to pathed.  Does this sound 
correct to you?

Please let me know.

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type.  Our Unify 
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting 
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like 
we did Southern Natural.  And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in 
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type 
manner.  We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production 
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the 
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't 
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the 
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream 
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify.  The pipe told me this is 
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area.  If it is 
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter 
the data twice today.  If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's 
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

Chris, thanks for the help on Friday.

I got two numbers from Tammi De Paolis.  In her voice message she referred to 
these numbers as meter numbers and then later as transfer point numbers so 
I'm not sure which they are.  One number is 6562 and the other is 6068 
(Public Serv. NC).

From this information can you determine whether these points are on the 
Transco mainline or a lateral off the mainline?

Thanks

I came up with $2.60218 on Cook School Road for March and $2.93210 for April
(using new fuel rate).  Maybe I'm calculating it wrong!  Tell me how you
calculated it.

For Nora I got the same rate you did $2.11

Subject: Oct buy back

Hey team.

I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New 
Power) at the pool.  This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New 
Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.  I'm using the 
following FOM numbers

1st-6th  51,762
7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st
27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st

Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through 
the 25th.  Not as much as I thought.

Re:  Texas Gas Transmission Fuel Retention Effective 11/1/00

On August 31, 2000 Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas
Gas) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-518-000
to change the Effective Fuel Retention Percentage (EFRP)
under its Rate Schedule FT which Transco utilizes to render
service to its customers under its Rate Schedule FT-NT.
Texas Gas has proposed to change its EFRP from 3.37% to
3.27% for the Winter Season (November - March) and from
2.68% to 2.96% for the Summer Season (April - October). If
accepted as proposed, the revised Texas Gas fuel percentages
would result in the following changes in Transco's current
Rate Schedule FT-NT Fuel Percentages effective November 1,
2000.

Winter Season - 0.09% decrease
Summer Season - 0.26% increase

Please refer any questions to Risa Desmuke, Rate Department,

Hello Chris,
Remember the demand charge that was entered in the sales side that you killed 
about a week ago?(deal # 233091)  Well, the demand charges need to be in the 
purchase side not the sales side.  Per Bay State, Enron should be paying the 
demand charges.  Are they correct???  Bay State is also charging interest for 
late payment.  Please let me know if you need any more information.
Production month Amount
April   $14,850.00
May   $15,345.00
June   $14,850.00

Deal # 233091 for Bay State is charging a demand charge every month.  
Accourding to Bay State Enron should not be charging demand charges.  Could

Maureen Smith is down as the trader on the deal.  However, I am not sure if 
that is correct.  Please let me know if you are not the correct person to 
send this note too.  
Thank you for your help!

Hi Scott,

I got your message this morning regarding the releases for the Columbia

I understand you may be having a problem releasing to EnergyEXPRESS on CNG -
I'll see if I can't resolve that...

Subject: Daily Volume Requirements for 03/07/00



Chris--The attached spreadsheet contains our Daily volume requirements for 3/7
and 3/8 (except for the AGL numbers).   For 3/7 you will see two 'NOM'
Columns--one labelled '9AM' and one labelled 'Intraday' which is an update of
the requirements reported in the 9AM column.   The two columns will be
identical in instances where no change has been made.   Where the two numbers
differ, the Intraday value is the latest requriement.  In some cases where
there is storage (i.e., COH Choice) , you will see negative values for the
'PRIMARY' requirement.  This represents a situation where gas is being
withdrawn from storage and sold at the pool, along with the first-of-the-month
baseload daily 'PRIMARY' volume.

Please call if you have questions, etc.

NOTICE TO ALL SHIPPERS:

There will be a mandatory E-SCRIPT upgrade on Tuesday, February 8, 2000.

This upgrade will take approximately 45 min. to download via the Internet
using a 33.6 Kb modem connection (which is typical for dialup customers).
Please note that Altra customers will require additional time to upgrade.
If you prefer, you may call the E-SCRIPT Help Line at 1-800-895-8899 to 
request
software for this upgrade. We will need you to leave your company
name, contact person, mailing address and whether you need a set of diskettes
or a CD.

The upgrade will include the following E-SCRIPT modification:

Users will be able to enter volumes in Nominations via the Daily Volumes Tab
for nominations in normal mode.  This will allow nominations for different 
days
of the month on an activity, rather than 'retrieving' data for each day from 
the
main tab.

As always, please call the E-SCRIPT Help Line with any problems, questions
or suggestions.

Thank you,

Twyla Strogen
Manager, Business Technology Services

I went motorcycle riding last night - I think I need to get some better
winter riding gear.

We will definitely go to court next Tuesday at 1:00 PM.  All we are doing
is verifying Dad's signature on the will.  Once the judge sees us it should
only take about five minutes.

That's all I have for now.

Jeff, I believe this works out because we should be increasing our citygate

Jeff, I'm out all next week, just call Joann and she will get the pricing and 
enter the deals.

Also, just so I don't forget, I sold 5000 dth day of TCO Pool to New Power

I left a message for the manager of Transco's Rates Department to call me.  
If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities 
are the same now.  In Jan, the ""true backhaul"" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was 
$.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges.  We actually did 
some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.

I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until

Re:  FT and IT Rates effective February 1, 2001


On January 24, 2001, the Commission issued an order in Docket
Nos. RP97-71-020 and RP97-71-021 which, among other things,
approved the pro forma tariff sheets included with the filing.
The Commission's order also directed Transco to file actual
tariff sheets to be effective February 1, 2001.  Transco intends
to file the revised tariff sheets with the Commission on February
1, 2001.  If accepted as proposed, outlined below for your
convenience are Transco=s Rate Schedule FT and IT rates effective
February 1, 2001.

"Re: Sale to NYPA","According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show 
below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal: 
1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone 
SL Pool
2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65

Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after 
paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the 
prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone 
SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02 
(including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with 
Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this 
is a term firm sale to NYPA.

Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid 
price  and the transport expense?

Subject: CES Daily March Requirements for 4/3 and 4/4


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   4/3
(Intraday)     and 4/4  .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with
today's date contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes in this spreadsheet are not
current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Is contract 62164 a valid contract on CGAS?  It was highlighted in red in the 
2000ces02.xls sheet.  I updated the info based on what I see in Navigator and 
highlighted it in yellow.  And, if this is a valid deal, we need to add it to 
Sitara.

Chris,
We paid parking fees to Iroquois for 9905 and 9906 production months:

May 1999 $1,934.42       <- included in a wire on 6/18/99 for $1,498,033.81.
June 1999 $1,872.02       <- included in a wire on 7/22/99 for $1,393,799.19.
Total  $3,806.44


If you have any additional questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

"Local Production for June","John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Subject: Local Production for June

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

Hi Everybody,

I haven't input my CPA 8 numbers yet, I am still sorting them into market

wholesale issues.  I am hoping to have a couple of people look over my work,
but so far they have been unavailable when I finally got my numbers together.

"Here is your daily grin. Enjoy!","""Moths""

A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really
well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in
passionate love making.

The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, ""quick my husbandjust got
home, go hide in the bathroom!"" So the man runs into the bathroom.

Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. ""Why are you
naked?"" he asks.

Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here
and get ready to recieve you.""

""Okay."" the man replies ""I'll go get ready.""

He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a
naked man standing there clapping his hands.

""Who the fuck are you?"" the man asks

""I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid
of the moths you are having problems with.""

The husband exclaims, ""But you are naked!""

The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.

""Those little bastards!""

Chris,

1-  According to EES, the price on deal #116090 should be CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I 
+0.014.  However, Sitara shows the price index is CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I +0.032.  
Could you please verify which rate should I be using in billing EES?

2-  On deal #156406, I was told by Judy Barn that this is an internal 
(financial) deal, therefore, it did not get downloaded into Settlement.  
However, per Patricia Downey at EES, this is a financial deal that was turned 
physical.  Would you please also confirm this wherether we should bill EES 
for this deal or not?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Vivien:  I have spoken with the EES scheduler on two CNGP deals and on the 
40,281 volume (Sabine 702US) - this is a term deal that has always been 
IF+.014.  It appears that ENA has changed the adder.  Please check as to why 
this rate has changed.

Also on the CNGP deal where we (EES) has 186,180 at 3.406 - this is a 
financial deal that was turned physical.  You may need to check with a Chris 
Germany on both of these deals.  ENA doesn't even have this 186,180 entered.

Let me know.

The meter number is 4371201 and is at Hastings.  This meter is gathering 
dry.  This meter was a new meter set and will probably begin flowing at the 
end of October.  It is estimated to produce about 30 dths a day.  Please

Brian said the deal was done with Chris to use Enron's IPP. This has been 
scheduled.

TCO cannot attached Enron's FSS (storage) to Orwell and Lakesides GTS 
contracts. TCO could do an inground storage transfer between Enron and these 
accounts, however storage withdrawal and injection fees would be charged.

Per my other e-mail... we are on target in getting the total gas withdrawn 
from storage for  March. There is no need to do outside deals to get 
additional storage gas out of the ground. If you do outside deals, this just 
changes the amount of storage that goes to Choice.

Thanks.

Chris,

Have you had a chance to look at this yet?  It sound like NIMO is still 
willing to pay the fair amount, we just need to make sure that we actually 
bill them.  Let me know how I can help.

Chris,

Can you take a look at the attached spreadsheet that NIMO has sent regarding 
demand charges due Enron and we have not billed.  Kate and I are not sure if 
this has been billed correctly and wanted to verify with you.  Please advise.

I can be reached at 713-853-7912.

Phil,

Bruce asked me to e-mail our information to you.  The following spreadsheet
outlines the amounts we owe you for each production month.  This shows you
the exact charges we are to pay along with how much credit we are due in
each production month.  Each MARQ and FTNN charge on CNG Demand is credited
on our monthly CNG Demand billing.  This is showing us that you should have
been billed this amount by CNG Transmission and then in turn you should
bill us these amounts.

               (Embedded image moved to file: pic07770.pcx)

If you need any backup in regards to these demand charges, please notify me
by e-mail or you may call me at (315) 460-4122.  These amounts are showing
outstanding in our accounting statements, so therefore, I will be happy to
assist you in any way I can to get these amounts paid.  When billing,
please fax me a copy of your complete bill and also mail an original in the
mail.  According to our contracts, we need an original invoice complete
with wire instructions in order to make payment to your company.

Sincerely,

Becky E. Morrow
Fuel Clerk of Gas Supply

Secondary non-recallable, you can use $.14 year round

$.05 for Apr-Oct which is probably a little high and $.15 for the winter.

The non-recallable factor is the hard thing to figure in.

Scott & Chris-

This is mainly just an FYI so everyone has all the same information.  Earlier 
today I had lunch with Ken Capp and Mike from CNG Sabine and they brought up 
the point that Enron is the only customer that is not using Sabine any 
longer.  Most of their customers are using a combination of Sabine (IHT 
Contracts) and CNG Transmission (TTT Contracts) for their daily business.    
Ken is concerned about losing Enron as a customer since in the past we did a 
lot of business through them.  Ken is now interested in doing some 
negotiating.  As of today, CNG Transmission will not be charging any fees 
until October at the earliest- if ever- for the service they are providing, 
but after October, the fee could be up to 84 cents per transaction, applied 
to the seller only.  Ken said that he would be willing to talk about lowering 
his rates for Enron if that's what it would take to bring us back into their 
customer list.  Of course, this is an exception to what they do for their 
other customers, so Ken is requesting that we keep this negotiation process 
confidential in the best interests of both parties.    If you have any other 
questions about this conversation, please let me know. 

Scott-  Ken's number is 713-752-4018, in case you don't have it.   

Just as a side note:  Ken also mentioned that they are looking into providing 
a hub service for Transco right now.

 Thanks!  -Angie

(It's Clayton, on my UT account from home)

I may have the perfect girl for you; she's a 29-year old *beauty* in
Ukraine, one of my wife's best-friends, about 5'2"" in height, slim,
smart but a bit quiet and introspective, who really wants to meet a
quality guy and get married and have children. She had her heart broken
by her first love, a guy who dumped her for a girl in Kiev whose father
gave the guy a good job. It seems the quality guys, as few as they are,
all want to marry a rich girl and want only money andnot children.

I'll bring a picture of her by your office tomorrow.

One hang-up- she doesn't speak English very well (yet). But, where
there's a will, there's a way.

Chris,

   Columbia Marketing has some outstanding invoices from Jan - Mar of this 
year
for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked 
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you have
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

   PS  Credit tells me that the Jan Gulf invoice is outstanding, also.

Subject: Beginning Hang Gliding

I don't want anyone to feel left out and please let me know if you don't want 
to see emails of this type in the future.  There is a beginning hang gliding 
class this weekend.  The class is offered through Leisure Learning 
Unlimited.  Go to web site http://llu.com/  select Adventure Unlimited, click 
on the line beginning with Gun Safety (that's next by the way).  Then scroll 
down, it's in there somewhere.  Or you could just give me a call to find out 
more.

Here is the schedule;
Lecture:  Sat  10am-noon, outdoors Sat 1-4pm and Sun 10am-4pm, March 4th & 
5th.

The lecture is at the LLU office on Richmond close to Kirby, I think.  The 
outdoors session is in Addicks, I'm sure that's outside the loop somewhere.

Cost:  $85.00 for the class and a $6.00 or $12.00 registration fee depending 
on which option you select.

Oh yeah, I may need to borrow a hacksaw if Dan Junek signs up!

until Thursday as Boston Gas and S. Ct. Algorithms will be available then.   I
have estimates in on those gates.  We will need a range from 2700 dth to 3600
dth per day.   This large swing is normal for these types of markets due to
weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Subject: CGAS contract 64231

This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has 
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss 
this with CALP (and she may have already)
     However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.

Can you help with this Dayton issue?  This is the one we discussed where 
Dayton is saying there is a fixed price and we have it in the system at 
index.  Can I get a list of all Dayton sales for CES so I can try to match 
them up?

We need to determine if this is another data entry error, or if CES provided 
us with incorrect data, or if Dayton is wrong and this really is an index 
deal.
Thanks for your help.

Subject: CES - Term Sell for Dayton Power Light on TCO - PLEASE READ

This deal haunts us every month. Need someone to verify that CES GMS pricing 
equals Enron's Sitara pricing. 

Just a reminder, the GMS report I used from CES system only had volumes and 
no pricing. I ensured the physical volumes were correct. Commerical still 
needs to verify the pricing on the deals. I don't think this has been done 
yet.

CES DEAL TICKETS
gms ticket # = s-dpl-0070 
term = 12/1/98 to 5/1/2001
volume = 5000

gms ticket # = s-dpl-0079
term = 12/1/99 to 5/1/200
volume = 5000



ENA DEAL TICKETS
135702 = 5000.
It appears I changed volume to 0 on 2/29


145321 = 10,000
This ticket has been used for the total 10,000. This may be incorrect. (April 
forward deal # is 227296).

The physical total volume is correct in Sitara, not sure about the pricing.

Thank you for your assistance.

Chris,

 I just finished talking with you about a deal that we sold to Clinton Energy 
Management (Deal #320094).  The volume that we have in our system has a 
volume of  13,330 MMBtu and it should be 13,551 MMBtu @ 4.56 (We only need to 
change the volume).  Could you please change this as soon as possible so that 
I can get a corrected invoice to them?  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks...

Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.

CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999.  
T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away 
effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn 
Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and 
according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.

T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive 
any and all ""cover"" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to 
April 1, 2000.

John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this 
need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he 
should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that 
question.

Subject: CES Booking of Transport--annuities to desk

I'd like to set up a meeting with the two of you (and whoever else you think 
needs to be there) to go over the booking of various deals.  For example, 
Dayton P&L--we pay out to them a big demand charge each month, but the desk 
should be getting an annuity payment back.  Where will they see this in their 
p&l?
CALP is another example.  Are you two available Tuesday around 12:00 to 
discuss?

I will make sure someone from the East Desk is there as well.  If there are 
any in the Central Region that are like this, let me know and I'll round up 
someone from that desk, too (unless you think they already know how theirs is 
working).

Thanks.

 Office of the Chairman
From: Office of the Chairman@ENRON on 10/05/2000 07:55 AM
To: ClickatHome mailout
cc:  
Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and will 
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new 
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is 
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You,ve 
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to 
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing the 
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where 
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the 
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of 
Internet knowledge at your family,s fingertips.  

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide 
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in 
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home 
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of 
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy 
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000 
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet 
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time 
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries; 
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT, 
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal, 
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being 
employed at the time of implementation.  
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of 
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delivery 
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of 
your initial questions, we,ve posted a question-and-answer document on 
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the near 
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can 
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com. 

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your 
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new level 
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in 
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe 
Enron is a great place to work.

Subject: Updated July FOM Volumes


The attached file contains updated July 2000 volume requirements for CES.  The
changes relative to the original request sent on 6/23/00.   Changes are
described on the worksheet labelled 'Comments' under the date 06/26/00.   The
only other change that I currently anticipate is to NIPSCO when they post our
July requirements on their EBB.

Please call me if you have questions, etc.

"Re: Calp Payments","Actually, my preference would be to have the contract released to ENA year 
round.  This means Robin would have to bill CALP for the commodity and demand 
during the summer.  Depending on the relationship you would like to have with 
the customer, I think it is easier to bill the customer for the demand and 
the commodity as opposed to reimbursing them for when we use the transport 
(at least with the way things work in our systems).

Subject: Re: Calp Payments



Paulette,

It's not Enron's intention to have Calp fund the OPT 60 payment. Enron
would like for Calp to release the capacity in Enron's name during the
winter period, and this would send the bills directly to Enron and
eliminate funding by Calp and reimbursement of Enron to Calp. We can look
at this again next winter. I'm not sure why there was a delayed payment
once Calp gave Enron the bill a month ago. I'll ask Mark Feldman about wire
transfers.

Thanks again for your patience.

Joan,

The deal with CES was that the invoice would be paid upon receipt.  It was
never
CALP's intent to fund the OPT 60 payment.  As requested, I will faxed
February's
bill to Robin.  Since the January payment is so late, could you have
January and
February's payments wire transferred to CALP's account?

Thanks!

Sorry for the delay. January's check will be sent out tomorrow, Friday

Thank you for your patience during this transition.

Example #1

Assumtion: PECO has 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity with a primary

What will Enron and PECO be able to schedule Iff PECO releases 10,000 dt/day 
of St 65 to PECO citygate under the following scenarios;

PECO schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and Enron schedules gas from 
Tetco/Ragley to Z6?

I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract 
for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end 
effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  

I entered the following deals at a zero commodity
470563  Buy exchange
470582  Sell Cpr Storage

470587 Buy CPR Storage
470568 Sell exchange


I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through 
March 31.  

I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.

Subject: Singer Deal Tetco M2

The following info was provided to me by Leah Moss at Tetco.

Meters 71979 and 71980 are on non-contiguous laterals.  Tetco doesn't know 
how this gas flows.  They are still checking into this one.  It may actually 
flow into CNG.,



Meters 72554 and 72803 are ""normal"" Tetco M2 meters.  This gas is a backhaul 
to Winridge and Hooker [make sure you use the backhaul contract] and a 
forwardhaul to Delmont and Oakford.  The forwardhaul fuel is 4.11%.

Subject: Re: Updated Mar'00 Requirements Received at 11:25am from CES



Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total
daily firm load across all 9 pools would average 36,774 dth/day.  This would 
be
met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as
the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing
gas.   On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1,
our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS
withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that
inventory down to the 35% level by March 31.  Otherwise, we could be liable 
for
penalties.   Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary
and keep drawing the gas out of storage.

Please call me if you have questions or wish to discuss further.

Subject:  Updated Mar'00 Requirements



Chris--The attached file contains updated needs requirements for March'00.
There are a couple of changes as compared to the update that I sent you
yesterday.  Please note that if you have been looking at the Total Monthly
requirements in the previous versions (in lieu of the daily dth volumes),
the
spreadsheet formula for summing the daily values to a monthly total were
only
picking up the first 29 days of March.  (This spreadsheet was originally
designed for February, which has 29 days.)   This has been corrected in the
attached version.

Sorry for any confusion.

Subject: Conversion of Gatherco Stations

Effective 04/1/2000, Columbia Gas Transmission will be transferring certain 
facilities to Gatherco, Inc.  There should have been a message in Columbia 
Navigator stating that there were certain meters that were going out of your 
IPP pool 37147 effective 4/2000.  The subject for this e-mail message was 
""Appalachian Meter Allocation"".  The meters listed in this e-mail will now be 
on Gatherco's gathering lines and are going to be subject to the $.25 
gathering rate.  Per Dave Fusek at Gatherco, our final estimates for 04/2000 
SHOULD reflect these meters that were changed from Columbia Gas Transmission 
to Gatherco.  He said he is not 100% positive that they will get this 
finished in time, but they are hoping to have everything complete by the time 
they release our nominations.

Gloria and Wade,

You will need to make sure you have the correct charges associated with these 
meters.  Some of these meters were previously subject to Columbia's $.27 
gathering and some were straight transmission, which did not have any 
gathering.  Again, these meters will now have a $.25 gathering charge.


Please call me if you have any questions.

Looks like we are getting another $5,000.00 from the asbestos settlement.
Maybe I should just keep this to myself.  I'm so poor and I need so much.

Don, why don't I mail this other ag exemption to you and you can fill it

Just a note to let you know Columbia Gas has some capacity postings on the 
EBB for next winter.  BIDS ARE DUE 3/15 AT 9AM.
Attached is a spreadsheet showing the parcel numbers.  I highlighted the 
meters that you did not have enough capacity to serve your load this winter.
I would be happy to bid on this as your agent, but let me know what rate 
works based on your economics.  This is a bid process, so the current low bid 
is just an indication of the market value of the capacity.

Subject: New and Exciting National Fuel Deal


We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons.

I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission 
invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I 
believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity.  
I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO 
Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on 
this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport 
expense.


According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these 
charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small.  
Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.

Questions??

Subject: Theoretical Storage Inventories


Scott and Chris--Yesterday, I asked Scott if you guys could provide me with a
summary of the volumes of gas sold to CES during April, May, June, and July 
for
the theoretical storage services under our 12/99 Agreement with ENA.   
Attached
is a file that I prepared showing the theoretical storage injections for the 4
storage services as they appear on ENA's monthly invoices.   I note that the
June injection for the TCO storage appears to be only about half of what we
requested and what appears in our GMS system.  My ultimate objective here is 
to
provide The New Power Company with  definitive estimates of the end-of-July
inventories (including left-over inventory from last winter) as well as the
volumes ""injected"" in July alone.  I hope the attached file helps.   If we
could get this resolved next week, that would be great.

Subject: Nat Fuel

I just received a call from Damon Sykes at National Fuel.  He said we have 
positive balance of 797,464 on our FSS  contract, and we have a balance of 
(797,163) on our ISS.  It looks like we paid back 301 dth too much.

Damon said we need to do a nomination to reverse the storage balances and we 
need to take out the 301 dt.  Would you guys speak to Nat Fuel about handling 
this please?

Don't worry about doing it this weekend, take care of it early next week.

Thanks

Chris,

Everything looks fine with the deal except the volumes.  The information that 
CES gave us had at least twice as much volume on both of those tickets.  Do 
they have the right to swing like that?

Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR (deal 136749) at ANR IF 
+.01.  and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS (deal 149838) at CGAS IF +.005.

The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara.  I just added the purchase deal on 
CGAS, it was not in Sitara.  Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover 
the ANR variable cost plus $.02.

 I have two deals ( #348393 and #226121) that I show were sold to EES that 
EES is not recognizing - they do not have on their books.  Can you either 
send me some support for these deals or get in touch with Jim Barker (with

Subject: Segmentation And Order 637 - Houston Meeting


July 21, 2000

To: All Operators, Producers, Shippers and Customers on the
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line System (Transco)

RE: Modifications to Capacity Release Processes and Segmentation
and Order 637 Compliance filings

On June 30, 2000 Transco made a compliance filing with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in Docket No. RP00-17-000.
This filing proposed several changes to the Capacity Release and
capacity segmentation procedures that are to become effective for
business beginning gas day September 1, 2000.  A customer meeting
will be held in Washington DC on August 1, 2000 at 10:00 a.m.
(please see the Transit posting dated July 14, 2000) and in Houston
on August  3, 2000 at the Williams Tower, Level 5, Dining Room C
at 1:00 p.m.  The Houston meeting will address both the segmentation
changes and highlights of Transco's Order 637/637A Compliance filing,
with segmentation being discussed from 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. and the
Order 637 discussed from 3 p.m. - 5 p.m.  In order to finalize
the appropriate arrangements for the meeting, Transco requests
that you notify Liz Laurel at 713-215-2069 by Monday,
July 31, 2000.

There are two key elements to the proposed changes
in Docket RP00-17-000:
1.  Use of ""Master"" FT-R Commodity Contracts
Transco will no longer use the ""Master"" Commodity Form of Service
Agreement for reservation rate capacity releases.  Historically,
Transco has required capacity release shippers to execute two FT-R
contracts upon their initial acquisition of released capacity:
the FT-R Demand contract and the FT-R ""Master"" Commodity contract.
With subsequent reservation rate releases, shippers were only
required to execute new FT-R Demand contracts.  Each FT-R Demand
contract was specific to a capacity release deal and the FT-R
""Master"" Commodity contract was used for all nomination and
commodity billing purposes.

Effective with business for gas day September 1, 2000, Transco will
require shippers acquiring capacity through reservation rate
capacity releases to execute and nominate transportation on each
new FT-R Demand contract.  This will require new activities to be
created for each capacity release contract.  For any capacity release
deals that span the August 31 - September 1 period, nominations for
gas day August 31, 2000 will be on the existing ""Master"" Commodity
contract and nominations for gas day September 1, 2000 will be new
transactions on the FT-R Demand contract.  Additionally, all
commodity billing will be done on the FT-R Demand contract.

Transco will send a ""Notice of Termination"" to all FT-R ""Master""
Commodity contract holders identifying the contract that will
terminate as well as a list of all of the FT-R Demand contracts
that will continue to be effective in September.

2. Limiting nominations within a segment
Consistent with FERC's ruling in this docket and consistent with
similar rulings on Tennessee and Texas Gas, Transco will limit the
quantity of gas that can be scheduled  IN ANY SEGMENT of the
pipeline to the original firm contracted capacity.
Transco will aggregate all nominations under an original FT
contract and any related capacity release contracts
(or subsequent re-releases) to ensure that the total scheduled
quantity for the family of contracts is within the original
contractual entitlement.  If nominations for the family of
contracts exceed the original entitlement, nominations using
any secondary capacity rights will be considered as secondary
nominations and subject to cut on a pro-rata basis.

As stated above, Transco intends to implement these changes for gas
day September 1, 2000.  In the event systematic changes cannot be
completed or the FERC directs Transco to modify its planned
implementation, Transco will notify customers via TRANSIT of any
business practice changes as well as the expected implementation
timeline.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact
your Customer Services Representative or Scheduling Analyst.

Chris-

What about Transco Zone 3?

Hey, I'm coming by with a picture of Natasha for you.

It's a huge long-shot, of course, a shot in the dark, but, hey- what the 
hell. The hardest thing about meeting her would be her getting a visa to come 
here. They're almost unavailable except for family members of US citizens. 
And, you'd be uncomfortable travelling there without an ""escort,"" so to 
speak, because you don't speak Russian.

Chris, remember we discussed this on Tuesday aftenoon - When we came in 
Sunday (after physical deals were transfered over to new books) we 
recaculated individual P&L's. Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240) 
was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had  to tranfer the 
difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at 
Friday's P&L.  This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose 
more than you think in Nymex.

On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals  
Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday  resulting in taking the 
Sunday's gain away from your book.  

Let me know if we need to discuss further. thanks.


Kimat

For the year

My NYMX book is a positive $138410.00 with the trade I did today.  This 
morining it should have been $123035.00.

I still have only 3 physical deals (all desk to desk) in my book, all valued 
at CNG IF flat.  I still don't see how I can have negative P&L of $128,818.

Just a note that the bill from TCO goes to Aristech and CES pays Aristech for
both demand and commodity. Any gas we buy from Enron should not include any
commodity costs. Thanks JPP

Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some
of Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature
swings that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a 50/50
split with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and
overdelivery gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!!  This has been approved
through Jeff Porter, the CES Choice God!!!!!

Also Joann Collins is on call this weekend. Friday is an ""unofficial
holiday"" for us. Joann will be in the office tomorrow morning to do Choice.


Contract Changes:

7-1: 67693     11558
     67829     5000 (aristech capacity)
Total          16558

     67829     3527 (aristech capacity)

Hello Chris!

I was writing to give you some good news and bad news.

Good news:  I got engaged last weekend.  I am very excited!  Todd is a very 
wonderful person.  This is the person I met on MM last year who lives in 
Columbus.

Bad news:  I am getting laid off.  I transferred to Columbus with Clinton.  
They are laying off half their staff.

I am not real fond of Columbus and hope to move back to Houston one day.  
Hopefully we can work together again one day.

Hope all is well with you!

Take care!

I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission 
invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I 
believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity.  
I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO 
Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on 
this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport 
expense.


According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these 
charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small.  
Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.

Questions??

Beverly has all the numbers.  Either Scott or Beavy needs to go into Transit 
as Enron North America tomorrow morning and execute the 4 segments listed.  
Beavy has the offer numbers.  We will have (hopefully) 115,000 dt's of pure 
3-3 segmented capacity, all on k#.7537.

Dan, next week we can probably create at least another 40,000 effective next 
Wed.

Tetco
We ran out of credit on ECT.  Scott will talk to Trish Meigs about that in 
the morning.  Kathy has a list of all the offer numbers that need to be 
executed.  AFTER the all offers have been executed, have Meredith check 
screen AN52 effective 4/1/2000.  Kathy, you might be able to do this too.  

Dan, I think you will be hurting for Tetco capacity.  Remember, we did 
release 3500 dts of Ela to M2 to IGS.

CNG
We have no fuel waivers from Canajoharie for April.  I just never got around 
to requesting them.  

Scott, Call Cindy McGinnis at 304-623-8854 and ask for fuel waivers on 
contract 5A2500 from Iroq/Canojaharie (meter 41101) to the following meters
NIMO East 20550, NIMO West 20500, East Ohio 20100, NYSEG 20700, RG&E 20600, 
and Hanley & Bird 21100.  I left her a voicemail to call you.  Ask her if we 
can send in the paperwork next week.  Let Scott Hendrickson, Robin, and Dick 
know what fuel waivers CNG approves.  I have all the CNG contracts on the 
worksheet.

I will be calling in the morining.

Chris,

   Columbia Marketing has some outstanding invoices from Jan - Mar of this 
year
for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked 
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you have
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

   PS  Credit tells me that the Jan Gulf invoice is outstanding, also.

In the old days, you could only flow 7/12 of the MDQ from secondary points.
That was when these contracts were good for the whole year.  So you are

You can use the full contract MDQ to move from and to secondary points.  Of
course,  this would be subject to any secondary restrictions.

We have a FTGSS contract with a MDQ of 40,148 dts.  The primary receipt
point on this contract is storage.  BUT, we can flow some of this gas from
secondary points like Oakford or the Pools.  How much gas can be sourced
from Secondary receipt points?

"Oct buy back","Hey team.

I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New 
Power) at the pool.  This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New 
Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.  I'm using the 
following FOM numbers

1st-6th  51,762
7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st
27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st

Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through 
the 25th.  Not as much as I thought.

try my sheet again, it is adjusted to pool and the 1st is still good. Since 
COH is the only TCO market with any swing, I am sticking with those to 
calculate. We look 5,000 off on 2 & 3. 
I have 41,858(FOM)+15,000 (NP Buy)-53,798(TCO usage)=(3,060) sell to NPC.
These were TCO totals but my COH numbers on 2 & 3 match, adjusted for F% to 
pool.

Storage deals require a meter on both the injection side and the withdrawal 
side in order to bridge - even if there is only a demand charge.
A zone is not enough, it must have a meter.  Let me know if that works.

"CNG Fuel Waiver's for March","For the balance of March, CNG has granted ENA fuel waivers from 
Iroq/Canajoharie to the following CNG citygates; NIMO (East & West), NYSEG, 
and Hanley & Bird.  According to this morning's sheet, we are delivering 
about 11,000 dt to these 4 delivery points.


Following are 2 ways of getting the gas into CNG at Canajoharie.

1.  Idle some of our Tenn Z6 capacity and flow Iroquois in to CNG.  At 
today's prices we save:
 
 Savings
 Tenn Variable $.0491   at $3.00
 CNG Fuel $.0672  at  $2.88
                                               ------------
 Total Savings $.1151
 
 At these prices, if the Tenn Z6 and CNG pool spread is inside $.1100, we 
should idle Tenn capacity and deliver Iroq to Canajoharie

2.  Buy Waddington, get an IT discount from Wadd to Canajoharie.  We save the 
CNG fuel cost.  This usually only works when Iroq shows a discounted rate of 
$.04 to $.06.
 

Last year, CNG granted most of these fuel waivers all summer.

Robin only bought 2074 dt's for the 2nd.  According to the sheet, the Tenn Z6 
volumes were 2220 dt's.  I told Brian at CES we were going to short Energy 
North by 146 dt's (the requested 1227 dt's but we only have 1081 dt's).  

Please let me know how you sourced the gas.

"Support for the manual invoice for April 2000","I will send these as I find them.  This is the detail I sent to Jeff for the 
April 2000 manual invoice.  It looks like the only deals that should have 
been suspended are the citygate CGAS sales.

Line 7 under the ""Manual Invoice"" tab applies to deal 268094, volume of 
615600 at $3.1279, sale to CES for Proxy storage injections.
Line 6 applies to deals 227081 and 227113, sales to CES at the citygate.
Line 8 shows the incremental transport expense ENA incurred to allow CES to 
swing.  Today I would take this expense and add it to the sales price on 
deals 227081 and 227113.
Line 9????  I still can't figure out what I did here.

I think everything else is sorta clear.

"New Power Bookouts","I'm checking all my deals and found I need to add the following.

Bookout deal 533305 with 533306 (volume of 688 day for the 1st - 31st).

Bookout deal 533317 with deal 533319 (volume of 5000 day for the 5th - 31st).

The last problem deals I see are 516286 and 521475.  This is not a bookout,  
One of these should be killed and I think it should be the purchase deal 
516286.  We should see New Power scheduling gas out of our pool.  The volume 
on the 5th - 31st should be about 40,257 day.  Just a note, since I think the 
purchase deal should be killed, this would make us 520,000 shorter for the 
month in Sitara.

I left a voicemail for Mike Garred to verify.

If this is for a volume of about 10,000 Dth it is a pool-to-pool transfer 
from ENA (we are transferring this gas from Power Gas Marketing's pool).  
When ENA purchased CES's book of business they acquired local production 
behind the citygate.  This is one of those deals.  I did this deal with Chris 
Germany of ENA.  If you need more information please let me know.  Thanks!  md

Hey Marde!

Our system shows we purchased this gas from ENA.  However, ENA does not have 
this in their system.  Could you please give me a little more information on 
the following:

July Business:
Pipeline -  EOGS
Point ID -  P-ECT-1186-001
Rec Meter -  IMBPURCH
Deal Meter -  11264

Thank you so much,
Anate

"Re: Hey Wiseone","If you nom from Onshore straigt to Leach, you pay Comm (meaning without ACA 
or GRI) and ACA, the ship Leach to TCO Citygate and pay Comm + ACA + GRI.  If 
you go from Leach to your TCO pool, you pay the same CGLF stuff and no charge 
on TCO at all.  

Next question, you have SST and you go from the pool to STOI, you pay the SST 
Comm + ACA + GRI into storage.  When you use SST to go from STOW to the 
Citygate, you only pay Comm, no ACA or GRI (i think).


Backs doing ok.  Going on vacation on the 9th and I can't wait.  And yes it 
has been a stressfull bid week.  But you r probably making tons of dough.

I need a correct answer to my question... I know you will not lead me a
stray.

If I buy onshore, take it through mainline, take it through leach, and take
it to a delivered gate on TCO. Do I just pay GRI  once at TCO delivered
point. If I drop it off in TCO pool, then I pay the GRI there?? I can't seem
to get a straight answer from my accountants and TCO. It looks like our
model is adding the GRI at each leg... opps.

Thank you sweetie!!!!

How's your bidweek... mine sucks!!!

         REDNECK VALENTINE!

    Collards are green,
    my dog's name is Blue
    and I'm so lucky
    to have a sweet thang like you.

    Yore hair is like cornsilk
    a-flappin in the breeze.
    Softer than Blue's
    and without all them fleas.

    You move like the bass,
    which excite me in May.
    You ain't got no scales
    but I luv you anyway.

    Yo're as satisfy'n as okry
    jist a-fry'n in the pan.
    Yo're as fragrant as &quot;snuff&quot;
    right out of the can.

    You have some'a yore teeth
    for which I am proud.
    I hold my head high
    when we're in a crowd.

    On special occasions,
    when you shave under yore arms,
    well, I'm in hawg heaven
    and awed by yore charms.

    Still them fellers at work,
    they all want to know,
    what I did to deserve
    such a purdy, young doe.

    Like a good roll of duct tape
    yo're there fer yore man,
    to patch up life's troubles
    and fix what you can.

    Yo're as cute as a junebug
    a-buzzin' overhead.
 You ain't mean like those far ants
    I found in my bed.
    Cut from the best cloth
    like a plaid flannel shirt,
    you spark up my life
    more than a fresh load of dirt.

    When you hold me real tight
    like a padded gunrack,
    my life is complete.
    Ain't nuttin' I lack.

    Yore complexion, it's perfection,
    like the best vinyl sidin'
    despite all the years,
    yore age, it keeps hidin'.

    Me &quot;n&quot; you's like a moon pie
    with a RC cold drank,
    we go together
    like a skunk goes with stank.

    Some men, they buy chocolate
    for a Valentine's Day,
    they git it at Wal-Mart,
    it's romantic that way.

    Some men git roses
    on that special day
 from the cooler at Krogers,
    that's impressive, I say.

 Some men buy fine diamonds
    from a flea market booth.
    &quot;Diamonds are forever&quot;,
    they explain, suave and couth.

    But for this man, honey,
    these won't do.
    Cause yo're too special,
    you sweet thang you.

    I got you a gift,
    without taste nor odor,
    more useful than diamonds....
    IT'S A NEW TROLL'N MOTOR!!!

Hello

Watch your ""snail mail"" for your invitation to:

Iroquois' 5th Annual Customer Golf Tournament
Monday, August 21
8 am
Tower Ridge Country Club
Simsbury, CT

For a sneak peek (sorry, photos but no course map), visit their website
at http://www.towerridgecc.com/

If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact Robin Almond
at the phone number or e-mail address listed at the end of this message.

We look forward to seeing you on August 21.

-- Your friends at Iroquois.

PS - It has just come to my attention that there is a typo on the reply
page of the invitation - it says ""I will/will not be attending Iroquois'
Canadian Golf Tournament"".  Although the 5th and 6th holes are pretty
high up on Heublin Ridge, we haven't relocated the tournament to north
of the border, its still in Connecticut. My apologies.

I left a message for the manager of Transco's Rates Department to call me.  
If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities 
are the same now.  In Jan, the ""true backhaul"" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was 
$.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges.  We actually did 
some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.

I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until 
October, after the summer period?

On January 24, 2001, the Commission issued an order in Docket
Nos. RP97-71-020 and RP97-71-021 which, among other things,
approved the pro forma tariff sheets included with the filing.
The Commission's order also directed Transco to file actual

Subject: Updated CES Jun'00 FOM Requirements


The attached file is an update of the CES FOM June'00 request that was
transmitted on 5/26/00.  The changes between this version and the original
version are listed in the worksheet labelled ""Comments"".   The only changes
versus Friday's transmittal are to AGL volumes delivered on Transco.

The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun00 EPA Vols' 
show
volume requirements at the various citygates.  I have not adjusted our volume
requirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per 
Chris
Germany's e-mail of 5/24/00.  However, I have inserted notes indicating where
and what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by local
production per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.

Also:  The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/99 Energy
Purchase Agreement between Enron and CES.  During June 2000 CES will be
procuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should not
be confused with this request.

Driscoll's, I think there was a Mark and Mike that I came close to sending 
this to.



  Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue 
  and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. 
  Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, 
  Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. 
  You move like the bass which excite me in May. 
  You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. 
  Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. 
  Ye're as fragrant as ""snuff"" right out of the can. 
  You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; 
  I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. 
  On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, 
  well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. 
  Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, 
  What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. 
  Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, 
  To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. 
  Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. 
  Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. 
  Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, 
  You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. 
  When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, 
  My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. 
  Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. 
  Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'. 

  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, 
  We two go together like a skunk goes with stank. 

  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; 
  They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way. 

  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, 
  From the cooler at Kroger. ""That's impressive,"" I say. 

  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. 
  ""Diamonds is ferever,"" they explains, suave and couth. 

  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. 
  Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you. 

  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, 
  More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor!

Here is a more updated volume breakdown.   We swing down on weekends (and
sometimes during the week if the customers shut down).   These volumes are 
good
except for Boston Gas and S. Ct.   We are waiting for the ldc demand curves 
and
Algorithms.   Those two ldc volumes represent our estimates.

Chris, 

I spoke to Rich.? We don't keep records in such a way that would give us the 
temperature at which we restrict Linden.? We determine 
secondary/interruptible space at Linden based on utilization.? Of course 
utilization is ultimately based on temp... but we just don't have an answer 
for you.? Part of the question is, at what temp do northeast LDCs utilize 
their full contract entitlements?

Subject: Tennessee's CanEast Project and Transco's MarketLink Expansion

Tennessee is finalizing their CanEast project which will scoop the 
Independence Pipeline effort and allow Tennessee to deliver 280,000 Dthd into 
Leidy beginning in 11/1/01 at the same time the first phase of Transco's 
MarketLink begins.  The first phase of MarketLink has a capacity of 166,000 
Dthd and the second phase is scheduled to begin 11/1/02 with an additional 
130,000 Dthd.  Tennessee was the successful bidder on a recent open season 
that National Fuel had for 19,100 Dthd of space between Niagara and Leidy.  
Tennessee has executed a 10 year lease for the space.  They will use this 
capacity and a 10 year lease arrangement that they are finalizing with 
Dominion Transmission for Ellisburg to Leidy capacity to form the basis of 
their CanEast Project.  The Dominion lease will allow Tennessee to use 
unsubscribed Zone L to Zone 4 capacity and deliver approximately 260,000 Dthd 
from the Gulf Coast to Leidy.  (Dynegy negotiated an index-based, revenue 
sharing contract with Tennessee for delivery into Dominion using this 
capacity for the 11/1/00 - 10/31/01 period).  Tennessee is currently 
negotiating with shippers to subscribe to the CanEast capacity.  They are 
willing to negotiate contracts less than ten years and have negotiated terms 
that synch up with the second phase of MarketLink.  This should allow 
available capacity from the Gulf Coast or Niagara to Leidy or secondary 
delivery points such as Dominion (since Phase I of MarketLink is set) for one 
year contracts.

As a reminder, firm shippers with binding contracts on MarketLink are:


Phase I (11/1/01 start)   Volume  Delivery Point  Comment

Aquila Energy Marketing    25,000 Dthd Manhattan(Con Ed) Option to change to
          11/1/02 start date
Consolidated Edison     30,000  Manhattan(Con Ed)
ConEdison Energy     10,000  Manhattan(Con Ed)
St. Lawrence Cement       1,000  Camden
Williams Energy Marketing  100,000  Manhattan(Con Ed)

Total Phase I    166,000 Dthd

Phase II (11/1/02)

Virginia Power Energy Marketing 100,000 Dthd Trenton-Woodbury Non-New York
PPL Energy Plus     30,000  Princeton Junction Non-New York

Total Phase II    130,000 Dthd

Transco has until the end of April 2001 to file additional binding executed 
contracts with the FERC for an additional 404,000 Dthd of Leidy to New York 
capacity or the MarketLink Expansion as approved by FERC will be limited to 
the 296,000 Dthd of the first two phases.

On the Tennessee side this deal was handled as a Back to Back and was 
therefore
not 'scheduled' so I really never dealt with the particulars of this deal.  I
will try and dig up whatever info I can find on this issue.

Subject: Questions about CES Capacity

I have a few questions about CES Retail's firm capacity. I am trying to
determine what capacity CES had that was assigned to ENA, with contract
details. I combined a few spreadsheets but still have questions. Mostly I am
looking for some of the following; contract #, RP, DP, MDQ or term. Also not
sure if capacity K#s I have were CES's, then assigned or ENA's own. Can you
please assist?

1. TCO K#64651-is it CES' or ENA's? delivers to CMD4-25
2. TCO COH7-1, Exhibit 1 shows 20,000 of capacity for C&I. I have no details 
on
this K.
3. TCO K#62164- I believe it delivers to COH7-4, but I have no details.
4. TCO K#65403- believe it delivers 19,000+ to BGE, but need all detail.
5.  CNG NORTH- K#'s 5A2291/5A2181 and 5A2292/5A2182; deliveries to NIMO, CES's
or ENA's?
6.  Have a bunch of contracts to TETCO M3, CES or ENA? see below

7.  TRANSCO Z5-Ex 1 shows 150 capacity, I have no details.
8.  TRANSCO Z6- for LILCO, is this released monthly to ENA?
9.   Texas Gas Z-4 to DP&L- monthly also?
10. Did CES have any ColGulf capacity that was assigned?

Call me if you have questions.

Please bring in an extra 128 dth/day for 1/20 through 1/24 to CES EU.  For
today I've talked to WGL and we can bring the extra in on Cove Point.

Per my voice mail please let me know that today's increase will flow as soon

propane.

Thank you!

"CES Transport","Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4 
capacity each month.  Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month.  We 
have been using this capacity since Jan 1 to serve the CES Zone 4 markets.  
According to Steve, the primary path on this capacity is Zone SL to Dayton's 
meter in Zone 4.

I have been pricing all the Texas Gas Zone 4 at IF CNG App.  I believe we 
need to add a Texas Gas Zone SL IF  and make the premium $.01.

I have not brought this to CES's attention.  They will eventually catch it 
because we have been billing CES the transport demand charge.

I just plugged/fugged/guessed at the demand charge.  When Dana does her

Hey Chris, CES/CNR Contract 515. Can you set this up just like the other CNR 
contracts that you have set up in the past.. Please set up for Jan 1 start 
date. Deal # 77283 is a CNR contract that you can copy. If this is something 
you can get me to do, let me know. I have approximately 70 contracts that 
need to be set up very soon for CNR. Wade is starting to pay the Jan 
invoices. Thank you, Rob

377264 475

Kimat, you need to do some of that voodoo economic stuff because this deal 
has hedges.

Joann & Alvin, this will not be part of the Citygate deal for Choice, this is 
a citygate sale to New Power at WGL.

Dave, where are my New Power golf shirts, one for me, one for my sidekick 
Scott.

Hey.. how's it going??

How's your back??? How was Easter???

I may come down for the TCO/Gulf meeting in May. Have to get the blessing of
my boss first.

Who is doing TCO pool??? The screen says John Hodge... he is really a nice
guy.

Is John (can't remember last name)... TCO appalachian guy from CES... still
at Enron?? Do you have his number?? I've been given the order to start
finding appal gas... what a joy. I thought I would give Jim Javins a call
too.

Hope all is well for you.
