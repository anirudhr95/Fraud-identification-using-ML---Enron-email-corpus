MODELING GROWTH

Prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who
delude themselves (James 1:22).

I am learning about pastors and missionaries across the country
who are preaching against the very sins they are committing
themselves. Nationally known Christian personalities who
vehemently condemn immorality have themselves been found to be
hiding an immoral lifestyle. Those of us who are called to preach
or teach God's Word must put it on first. We must get on our
knees before God as we prepare the message and say, ""God, is this
Scripture true in my life?"" If not, we had better be honest
enough to say to those who hear us, ""I wish I were a better
example of this passage than I am, but I'm still growing in this
area."" To proclaim the Word of God as if it were true in your
life when it's not is a lie.

Those of us who receive the Word are also vulnerable to
self-deception if we fail to put it into practice. We hear a
sermon or a lesson and say, ""Wow! What a great truth!! and hurry
off to share it with someone else without processing it ourselves
and applying it to our own lives. James said that hearers of the
Word who are not also doers of the Word deceive themselves.

Why are we afraid to admit it when our lives don't completely
match up to Scripture? I believe it's because many of us have a
perfection complex. We think we have to model perfection and not
admit to something less. But we can't model perfection, because
we're not perfect; we can only model growth. The people around us
need to know that we are real people in the process of maturing.
They need to see how we handle failure as well as how we handle
success. When we model this kind of honesty in the Christian
community, we greatly reduce the possibility of the deceiver
gaining a foothold.

Lord, forgive me for the times I have placed the quest for
earthly perfection ahead of growth in You and Your Word. Help me
model growth in my life today.

First Fruits

All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are
sacred to the Lord and must go into His treasury.
- (Joshua 6:19)


One of the earliest examples of the practice of giving God the
first fruits of the increase was when Joshua and the people
entered the Promised Land for the first time. When they crossed
the Jordan River, their first battle was Jericho. God set a
precedent with this battle by instructing them not to take any
spoils from it. Unlike future battles, the fruits from this
victory were to go into the treasury as a remembrance of their
first victory in the Promised Land. In addition, the city of
Jericho was to be a lasting monument to God's faithfulness. God
instructed Joshua never to rebuild this city. If they or anyone
in the future attempted to rebuild the city, the life of the
firstborn would be required. Years later, Ahab attempted to
rebuild this city and his firstborn died as a result. God never
forgets to enforce His Word.

Is your work a lasting monument to the faithfulness of God in
your life? Is it bringing glory to the Father? Are you giving the
first fruits from your increase to God? God has encouraged us
through this story to give the first fruits of our work to Him so
that He will be glorified through our work. This is a tangible
way for us to acknowledge that God is the source of all blessing.

THE WILL OF GOD

If any man is willing to do His will, he shall know of the
teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from Myself
(John 7:17).

Knowing the will of God is not just a twentieth-century problem.
People were struggling at the time of Christ. Some people were
saying of Him, ""He's a good man."" Others were saying, ""He leads
the multitude astray"" (see John 7:12). How could these people
know whether He was leading them into truth?

Seizing the opportunity, Jesus set forth standards of divine
guidance. His first admonition was, ""My teaching is not Mine, but
His who sent Me. If any man is willing to do His will, he shall
know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak
from Myself"" (John 7:16, 17). The essential prerequisite to know
the will of God, according to Jesus, is a willingness to do it.

What is the will of God? God's will for those who believe in Him
is to be alive in Christ for the purpose of establishing His
kingdom by overcoming the evil one and becoming fully the people
He has called us to be. Notice the opening words of the Lord's
Prayer: ""Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy
kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven""
(Matthew 6:9, 10). When praying this prayer, we are asking for
God's will to be accomplished on earth as it presently is in
heaven. Apparently God's will is being perfectly executed in
heaven but not on earth.

Are you totally committed to do God's will without knowing for
sure what it is? Do you hold any reservations about turning your
will over to God? Do you really believe that God's will for you
is good, acceptable and perfect (Romans 12:2)? If God is God and
you call Him Lord, doesn't He have the right to exercise His will
in your life?

Father, may Your will be accomplished in my thoughts, words and
deeds today as it is being accomplished in heaven.

N E I L   A N D E R S O N   D A I L Y   D E V O T I O N A L
             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

February 3

SALVATION IS REGENERATION

He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, in
order that by them you might become partakers of the divine
nature (2 Peter 1:4).

What does the Bible specifically say about our nature? The Greek
word for nature is used in this way only twice in the New
Testament. Ephesians 2:1-3 described the nature we all shared
before we came to Christ: ""And you were dead in your trespasses
and sins . . . and were by nature children of wrath."" What was
your basic nature before you were born again spiritually? You and
every other Christian ""were by nature children of wrath,"" dead in
sin, subject to Satan's power, living completely to fulfill
sinful lusts and desires. This is the condition of every
unbeliever today.

The second occurrence of the word is in 2 Peter 1:4 describing
our nature after we came to Christ: ""He has granted to us His
precious and magnificent promises, in order that by them you
might become partakers of the divine nature.""

When you came into spiritual union with God through your new
birth, you didn't add a new, divine nature to your old, sinful
nature. You exchanged natures. Salvation isn't just a matter of
God forgiving your sins and issuing you a pass to heaven when you
die. Salvation is regeneration. God changed you from darkness to
light, from sinner to saint. There is a newness about you that
wasn't there before. If God hadn't changed your identity at
salvation, you would be stuck with your old identity until you
died. How could you expect to grow to maturity if you didn't
start as a transformed child of God? Becoming a partaker of God's
nature is fundamental to a Christian's identity and maturity.

We are no longer in Adam; we are in Christ. We can still choose
to walk according to the flesh, but why should we want to? ""You
are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of
God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of
Christ, he does not belong to Him"" (Romans 8:9).

Lord, may my understanding of who I am in Christ grow today so
that I may walk in the victorious life You secured for me.

"INFO ALERT: MERH","
   NEW CORPORATE PLAYER IN THE INDUSTRY AGAINST CYBER-TERRORISM   [IMAGE]  IMMEDIATE BUY RECOMMENDATION Initiating Research Coverage   Merilus Inc.    Symbol: MERH Shares Outstanding: 13.2 million Share Price: $1.90 Market Capitalization: $25 million 52 Week Hi/Low: $8.50/$0.45 Estimated Public Float: 2 million shares  Developed over the last four years, Merilus has recently started marketing the latest and most advanced computer security products targeted for small to medium businesses.   This market has been, and is projected to be, one of the fastest sectors in technology, largely unaffected by the current weakness in the market.      THE PROBLEM AND OPPORTUNITY A Computer Security Institute and FBI survey showed 90% of large organizations detected breaches into their computing systems.  74% of these organizations acknowledged financial losses.  Price Waterhouse estimated this loss to be about $40 billion last year.  The estimated number of computer attacks doubled last year according to the Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University.  International Data Corp. (IDC) predicts the compounded annual growth rates of digital security revenues will continue at over 88% per year over the next 5 years.    Merilus' products target small to medium businesses, a particularly fast growing segment of the overall security market, which has been underserved by the major security manufacturers.  IDC estimates the small to medium business percentage of the total internet security software market will increase from the current 43% to about 70% by 2004. In terms of dollars, this means companies with fewer than 1000 employees could spend about $7.4 billion on security in 2004.  We strongly feel Merilus is focusing on the right market, at the right time.   MERILUS SOLUTIONS Merilus' computer software and hardware products represent major innovations, which protect against computer information theft from hackers and others both outside and within the business.  Their recently introduced FireCards are the world's first network security system and firewall (controlling who can access what type of data) that easily inserts into the standard PCI slot inside the computer. It is a computer within the computer allowing for remote updating of new innovations and security measures to ensure sensitive data is protected as well as transmitted in a secure manner.   Industry reviews have given the new products high ratings.  Secure Computing Magazine gave the FireCard a five out of five star rating and The Tech Zone awarded a 9.5 out of 10 score.  NASA and Lockheed Martin are just a couple of the sophisticated organizations that have started using Merilus products.  Even though Merilus and its products are relatively new to the market place we feel they will also have good acceptance because they are extremely price competitive.  Management will strive to maintain its current 2:1 cost/feature ratio, where products are either half the price of competitors for the same functionality or twice the functionality for the same price.  Manufacturing of the products is contracted out to keep capital and inventory costs down and flexibility up.   THE ROLLOUT Over the summer, after rigorous testing in Compaq's labs, Merilus has become a member of the Compaq Solutions Alliance, allowing installation of products into Compaq computers. Merilus recently announced they have partnered with the three largest distributors in North America: Ingram Micro, Tech Data and EMJ.  Last week Merilus announced its Reseller Program, which provides marketing and technical support as well as substantial rebates to vendors selling Merilus' suite of computer security products.   MANAGEMENT Dana Epp, President of Merilus started writing commercial security monitoring software at the age of 14 and authored the book Computer Security Concepts, Managing Business Threats in a Wired World.  Merilus has attracted a number of credible and notable Board members such as John Connally, son of the former US Treasury Secretary, John Paul DeJoria, Chairman of John Paul Mitchell Systems.   FINANCIALS and PROJECTIONS Two companies established in this industry are SonicWall (SNWL) and Watchguard Technologies (WGRD).  Over the last couple of years these two companies have enjoyed approximately 100% annualized revenue growth.  Analyst's consensus (Thompson Financial) is that they will have sales growth next year of about 50% and 40%, respectively. Merilus is in the process of raising $3 million in a Private Placement to power its marketing initiatives, increase inventory and to strengthen its balance sheet.  Management and its financiers expect to close this needed funding before year-end. Currently the Company has minimal, but rapidly increasing revenues.    Management is estimating revenues of $8 million next year increasing to $34 million in 2003.  In 2003 they estimate achieving net income of roughly $4 million.  By 2003, we estimate the shares outstanding could increase to about 18 million.  If these numbers were met and a price to earnings ratio of 30 was applied, it could suggest a possible $6 share price.  Management's latest estimates are for revenues increasing to $93 million in 2004.  Merilus is little known in investment circles however an Investor Awareness Program is expected to start next week.

THE EQUATION FOR WHOLENESS

Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and
many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and
destruction (1 Timothy 6:9).

In his book The Sensation of Being Somebody, Maurice Wagner
expresses a false belief in simple equations we tend to accept.
He says we mistakenly think that good appearance plus the
admiration it brings equals a whole person. Or we feel that star
performance plus accomplishments equals a whole person. Or we
believe that a certain amount of status plus the recognition we
accumulate equals a whole person. Not so. These equations are no
more correct than two plus two equals six. Wagner says: ""Try as
we might by our appearance, performance, or social status to find
self-verification for a sense of being somebody, we always come
short of satisfaction. Whatever pinnacle of self-identity we
achieve soon crumbles under the pressure of hostile rejection or
criticism, introspection or guilt, fear or anxiety. We cannot do
anything to qualify for the by-product of being loved
unconditionally and voluntarily"" (Maurice Wagner, The Sensation
of Being Somebody, Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House,
1975, p. 163).

If these equations could work for anyone, they would have worked
for King Solomon. He was the king of Israel during the greatest
years in her history. If a meaningful life is the result of
appearance, admiration, performance, accomplishments, status, or
recognition, Solomon would have been the most together man who
ever lived.

But God also gave the king an extra dose of wisdom to interpret
his achievements. What was his commentary on it all?
""Meaningless! Meaningless! . . . Utterly meaningless! Everything
is meaningless"" (Ecclesiastes 1:2 NIV). Take the advice of the
wise king: All the stuff and status you can acquire don't add up
to personal wholeness. Millions of people climb those ladders to
success, only to discover when they reach the top that they are
leaning against the wrong wall! The only identity equation that
works in God's kingdom is you plus Christ equals wholeness and
meaning.

Heavenly Father, I affirm that nothing in this world can make me
more complete than I already am in Christ.

Sweating Outcomes

In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to
eat-for He grants sleep to those He loves.
- (Psalms 127:2)


Coming into the Promised Land in business will change the way you
and I view our work. No longer will we see getting up early and
staying up late as God's way. Living in the Promised Land in
business means we know that God is the source of our provision
and that our work is an act of worship to Him. Provision is a
by-product, not an end in itself. Work is no longer something
that must be sweated and toiled upon to make ends meet. ""Could
this really be true?"" you might be saying. God has made it clear
that obedience is the assurance of provision. Whenever we go
beyond the normal workday due to fear of non-provision, we are
operating in unbelief. We are saying that it is up to us to make
things happen. Sure, there are times when we work longer hours
due to a deadline, but we must be sure the motive is not out of
fear of loss or fear of non-provision. If we are obedient to what
God has called us to, He will provide our every need. This can be
a hard lesson for goal-oriented businesspeople.

I recall coming into this understanding. I had been a workaholic.
Long hours were common. Then God shook up my world and I was
challenged by a friend to examine my motives for working long
hours. I realized the source of those long hours was fear. Once I
came into this understanding, I refused to work long hours even
though the natural man would tell me I'd never make things happen
if I worked a normal work week. Again, this reasoning is based on
a lack of faith. If we are obedient to what God has called each
of us to, we will not lack. At times it may be less than what we
might like; at other times it may be more than we deserve. These
are God's ways.

The Bible tells us to come out of Babylon. Babylon is a system of
work and philosophy that is contrary to God's ways. Are you
operating in any aspect of work from a Babylonian value system?
Ask the Lord to reveal this to you. Begin to walk in the freedom
He has given us in our work life.

OUR DYNAMIC POWER SOURCE

. . . the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who
believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength
of His might . . . (Ephesians 1:19).

In Ephesians 1:19-21, Paul gives us a peek at the dynamic source
of our authority in Christ. He explains that the authority at our
disposal flows from the reservoir of power which raised Jesus
Christ from the dead and seated Him at the Father's right hand.
That power source is so dynamic that Paul used four different
Greek words in verse 19 to describe it: power (dunameos), working
(energeian), strength (kratous), and might (ischuos). Behind the
resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ lies the mightiest work of
power recorded in the Word of God. And the same power which
raised Christ from the dead and defeated Satan is the power
available to us to overcome the works of Satan in our daily
lives.

Paul opens our eyes to the expansive scope of Christ's authority
which is ""far above all rule and authority and power and
dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but
also in the one to come"" (Ephesians 1:21). Think about the most
powerful and influential political or military leaders in the
world. Imagine the most feared terrorists, crime kingpins and
drug barons. Think about Satan and all the power of darkness
marshaled under his command. Jesus' authority is not only above
all these human and spiritual authorities past, present and
future, but He is far above them. We share the same position
because we are seated with Christ in the heavenlies, which enable
us to live in freedom and victory over demonic intrusion and
influence.

Don't be deceived. You are not under Satan's power or subject to
his authority. You are in Christ above all demonic rule,
authority and power.

Reigning with You, Lord--what a liberating thought! I praise You
today for the power You share with me.

WSJ(1/14)Heard On The Street:Enron Ex-CEO Made Bet Vs. Rival 		

01/13/2002
Dow Jones News Services
(Copyright ? 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)


  By Ken Brown 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

When Jeffrey Skilling resigned as chief executive of Enron Corp. in mid-August, he said he wanted to spend more time with his three children. ""I've missed too many soccer games over the years,"" he told his brother Tom soon after he quit. 

But instead of standing on the sidelines, Mr. Skilling stayed in the game, making a big, speculative stock-market bet against an Enron rival. 

A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling confirms that he made the wager: a short sale initiated on Aug. 24 against shares of AES Corp., a big energy producer. A person familiar with the matter puts the trade's value at $30 million, though Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the estimate is ""way out of the ballpark"" on the high side. 

The bet came as AES's shares were tumbling, and, depending on when it was closed out, could have netted him a profit of more than $15 million. Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman, Judy Leone, confirms he did make a profit on the trade but won't say how much or when the trade was closed out. ""There is a category of personal financial information that we're going to respect Mr. Skilling's privacy on,"" Ms. Leone says. 

As CEO of Enron, which made most of its money trading in the volatile energy markets, Mr. Skilling was used to taking on risk. He pushed the company into several unproven businesses, including the trading of bandwidth, or network capacity, a market that ultimately didn't prove successful for the Houston company. Enron itself reveled in a swashbuckling attitude that ultimately contributed to its downfall; the company has been under bankruptcy-court protection since early last month. 

But a bet of this type was exceptionally risky. In short sales, investors borrow shares of a stock and sell them, hoping the stock will fall so they can replace the shares with cheaper ones. Such trades are riskier than buying a company's shares directly, because if the stock rises strongly, an investor with a short position on the shares can be forced to ""cover"" the bet at a sky-high cost. 

As it turns out, AES shares, along with those of other energy companies, fell steadily in the month after Mr. Skilling's resignation. Then on Sept. 26, AES stock tanked, falling by nearly 50%, when the company announced it wouldn't meet analysts' earnings estimates for 2001. If Mr. Skilling had maintained his short bet through that date, he could have earned better than 60% on his investment. 

AES, based in Arlington, Va., blamed the earnings shortfall in part on the fall in the Brazilian currency. AES wouldn't comment on Mr. Skilling's trading. ""Commenting on another company's now-departed executive's behavior is not a comment I think we ought to make,"" says Kenneth Woodcock, a company spokesman. 

Mr. Skilling's bet raises the question about whether he knew anything special about AES's business because of his work at Enron. Ms. Leone, his spokeswoman, says Mr. Skilling shorted the AES shares based on a July 30 page-one article in The Wall Street Journal that said AES was having trouble in its big Brazilian operations and would be hurt by the fall in the Brazilian currency. Based on information in the article and his general knowledge about how business in Brazil worked, he felt that the company's stock might fall in price. His trading decision was ""absolutely not"" based on any nonpublic information he had obtained while an Enron executive, she says. 

AES did trade energy with Enron, but only a small amount and only as a way to sell its output, rather than to earn a profit, according to Mr. Woodcock. He adds that there would be no obvious way for Mr. Skilling to have gained any unique or valuable knowledge about AES through Enron's dealings with his company. 

The trade was made through Mr. Skilling's account at Charles Schwab & Co., the big discount broker, and it created a buzz inside the firm's San Francisco offices. After the position was taken, ""we checked up on it a couple of days later, and a couple of days after that, and said, oh, it went down,"" says the person familiar with the trade. 

At the time of Mr. Skilling's resignation, Schwab executives in their newly opened private-client office in Houston were trying to sell Mr. Skilling on a plan to hedge the value of his Enron stock, the person says. Schwab executives in San Francisco had created an elaborate presentation for the hedging strategy, called a collar, but Mr. Skilling never acted on it, a decision that may have cost him millions, the person says. Mr. Skilling wouldn't comment on the collar proposal. 

At the time of his resignation on Aug. 14, the 1.1 million Enron shares that Mr. Skilling owned outright were worth about $47 million. He also had 500,000 vested options that were in the money, meaning their exercise price was below the stock's share price at the time. Mr. Skilling has said he sold about 500,000 of the shares he owned outright on Sept. 17, when the stock market reopened following the terrorist attacks. That sale would have netted him about $15 million, based on that day's volatile prices. 

His remaining 600,000 shares are worth $408,000 at Enron's current share price of 68 cents, and his options are worthless. Just accounting for the 600,000 shares he owns outright, the collar proposed by Schwab could have saved Mr. Skilling more than $30 million. 

Interestingly, professional investors often will try to hedge a big positive bet on a company in any given industry by shorting shares of a rival, on the theory that if the entire industry tumbles, the gains on the short sale would offset the losses on the long position. But Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the trade wasn't a hedge, adding that it was the ""first and only time"" he made a short sale and that right now the only stock Mr. Skilling owns is Enron. ""If he thought the stock price was going down he could have sold all his Enron shares; he didn't,"" Ms. Leone says. 

Enron and Schwab, which were often paired in magazine articles touting America's most innovative companies, had at least one minor business relationship. Schwab had handled a small portion of Enron's 401(k) called the ""brokerage window,"" which allowed employees to buy mutual funds not offered in the company's plan, as well as individual stocks for their 401(k)s. The relationship ended in July when Enron made some administrative changes to the plan and Schwab was replaced. 

Mr. Skilling isn't the only member of his family to suffer because of Enron's collapse. His brother Tom a Chicago television weatherman, bought 750 shares of Enron at $49 early last year ""because of these incredible analyst reviews"" of the company. He says he sold them in the fall at $27 to buy some land. ""Little did I know if I stuck with it I would have a 60-cent stock,"" he says in an interview from his vacation home in Alaska. 

He says his father suffered more: He bought 2,000 shares of Enron last year and still holds them. ""You wonder what in God's name were the analysts doing,"" Tom Skilling says. ""There were a lot of people lulled into, I don't know what, a comatose state.""

FORGIVING YOUR PAST

Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other,
just as God in Christ also has forgiven you (Ephesians 4:32).

The second step in resolving past conflicts is to forgive those
who have offended you. After encouraging Cindy, a rape victim, to
deal with the emotional trauma of her rape, I said, ""Cindy, you
also need to forgive the man who raped you."" Cindy's response was
typical of many believers who have suffered physical, sexual or
emotional pain at the hands of others: ""Why should I forgive him?
You don't know how badly he hurt me!""

""He's still hurting you, Cindy,"" I responded. ""Forgiveness is how
you stop the pain. You don't forgive him for his sake; you do it
for your sake.""

Why should you forgive those who have hurt you in the past?

First, forgiveness is required by God. As soon as Jesus spoke the
amen to His model prayer--which included a petition for God's
forgiveness--He commented: ""If you forgive men for their
transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But
if you do not forgive men, then your Father will not forgive your
transgressions"" (Matthew 6:14, 15). We must base our
relationships with others on the same criteria on which God bases
His relationship with us: love, acceptance and forgiveness
(Matthew 18:21-35).

Second, forgiveness is necessary to avoid entrapment by Satan. I
have discovered from my counseling that unforgiveness is the
number one avenue Satan uses to gain entrance to believers'
lives. Paul encouraged mutual forgiveness ""in order that no
advantage be taken of us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his
schemes"" (2 Corinthians 2:11). Unforgiveness is an open
invitation to Satan's bondage in our lives.

Third, we are to forgive like Christ forgave in order to keep our
hearts from bitterness. Paul wrote: ""Let all bitterness and wrath
and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with
all malice. And be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving
each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you""
(Ephesians 4:31, 32).

Your act of forgiveness will set the captive free, then you will
realize that the captive was you!

Lord, teach me to forgive others from my heart as You have
forgiven me.

YOUR POSITION IN CHRIST

Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from
you (James 4:7).

Daisy was one of the first persons I dealt with who was caught in
spiritual conflicts and suffered from demonic influences. She was
a Christian and a university graduate, but she had severe mental
and emotional problems which developed after her father divorced
her mother. Within a period of five years, Daisy had been
institutionalized three times as a paranoid schizophrenic. After
about three weeks of counseling with me, Daisy finally found the
nerve to bring up the nighttime visitation of snakes.

""What about the snakes?"" I asked.

""They crawl on me at night when I'm in bed,"" she confessed.

""What do you do when the snakes come?""

""I run in to my mother. But they always come back when I'm
alone.""

""Why don't you try something different,"" I continued. ""When
you're in bed and the snakes come, say out loud, 'In the name of
Christ, I command you to leave me.'""

""I couldn't do that,"" Daisy protested. ""I'm not mature enough or
strong enough.""

""It's not a matter of your maturity; it's a matter of your
position in Christ. You have as much right to resist Satan as I
do.""

Daisy squirmed at the prospect. ""Well, I guess I could do that.""
Daisy sighed, sounding like she had just agreed to take castor
oil.

The next week when Daisy walked in she said, ""The snakes are
gone!"" If her problem had been strictly a neurological or
chemical imbalance, taking authority over the snakes in Jesus'
name wouldn't have worked. But in Daisy's case, the problem was
spiritual.

James wrote: ""Resist the devil and he will flee from you"" (James
4:7). But if you don't resist him, he doesn't have to go. Or if
you just pull the covers over your head in fear and say, ""O God,
do something about these demonic influences,"" the evil spirits
don't have to leave. Resisting the devil is your responsibility
based on the authority you possess in Christ.

Dear Father, thank You for providing me with such wonderful
power. Help me not to be afraid to use it for my sake and others.

Seeing the Works of God

Others went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the
mighty waters. They saw the works of the Lord....
- (Psalms 107:23-24)


When you were a child, perhaps you may have gone to the ocean for
a vacation. I recall wading out until the waves began crashing on
my knees. As long as I could stand firm, the waves were of no
concern to me. However, as I moved farther and farther into the
ocean, I had less control over my ability to stand. Sometimes the
current was so strong it moved me down the beach, and I even lost
my bearings at times. But I have never gone so far into the ocean
that I was not able to control the situation.

Sometimes God takes us into such deep waters that we lose control
of the situation, and we have no choice but to fully trust in His
care for us. This is doing business in great waters. It is in
these great waters that we see the works of God.

The Scriptures tell us that the disciples testified of what they
saw and heard. It was the power behind the gospel, not the words
themselves, that changed the world. The power wasn't seen until
circumstances got to the point that there were no alternatives
but God. Sometimes God has to take us into the deep water in
order to give us the privilege to see His works.

Sometimes God takes us into the deep waters of life for an
extended time. Joseph was taken into deep waters of adversity for
17 years. Rejection by his brothers, enslavement to Pharaoh, and
imprisonment were the deep waters for Joseph. During those deep
waters, he experienced dreams, a special anointing of his gifts
to administrate, and great wisdom beyond his years. The deep
water was preparation for a task that was so great he never could
have imagined it. He was to see God's works more clearly than
anyone in his generation. God had too much at stake for a
30-year-old to mess it up. So, God took Joseph through the deep
waters of preparation to ensure that he would survive what he was
about to face. Pride normally engulfs such young servants who
have such access to power at such a young age.

If God chooses to take us into deep waters, it is for a reason.
The greater the calling, the deeper the water. Trust in His
knowledge that your deep waters are preparation to see the works
of God in your life.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

The Famine That Leads to Freedom

Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not
die.
- (Genesis 42:2)


F. B. Meyer in his book, The Life of Joseph, describes a time in
the life of the 12 sons of Jacob in which they were driven from
their lives of self-satisfaction to an unlikely place to save
their lives. Many years earlier they had thrown their youngest
brother into a pit, then sold him into slavery. Thirteen years
later he became the second most powerful person in Egypt. Now the
world was experiencing a famine, and Joseph controlled all the
stored grain of Egypt.

As long as the hills were green and the pastures clothed with
flocks, as long as the valleys were covered over with corn and
rang with the songs of reapers, Reuben, Simeon, and the rest of
them would have been unconcerned and content. But when the mighty
famine came, the hearts of these men were opened to conviction.
Their carnal security was shattered. They were being prepared for
certain spiritual experiences they would never have dreamed. And
they were being prepared for the meeting with Joseph. This is how
God deals with us; He breaks up our nest, He loosens our roots,
He sends a mighty famine that cuts away the whole staff of bread.
Then, at such times, weary, worn, and sad, we are prepared to
confess our sins and receive the words of Christ when He says,
""Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give
you rest"" (Mt. 11:28).

A missionary once said, ""There is a place where we will all be
obedient."" Joseph was a type of Christ in the Old Testament. The
famine was an event designed to bring the brothers to repentance
and a saving knowledge, physically and spiritually. It created
the circumstances that led to freedom for these men. For they had
been in bondage to a wicked crime against their brother for many
years. It was the forgiveness from Joseph that led to that
freedom.

Is your life passing through a time of famine? Are your supplies
limited? Is God leading you into directions that you would not
normally seek? Perhaps this is God's hand creating circumstances
for His purposes. Now is the time to look attentively as He
directs you to unlikely sources.

Horizontal Versus Vertical

Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the
Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
- (Exodus 2:12)


Moses saw the pain of his people. He saw the bondage and the
injustice. His heart was enraged, and he decided he would do
something. He would take matters into his own hands. The result
was murder. The motive was right, but the action was wrong. He
went horizontal instead of vertical with God. The action was
wrong. Moses fled to the desert, where God prepared the man who
would ultimately be the deliverer of a nation. But it took 40
years of preparation before God determined Moses was ready. He
was a professional businessman-a sheepherder. It was during the
mundane activity of work that God called on him to be a
deliverer.

Moses was like a lot of enthusiastic Christian businesspeople who
seek to solve a spiritual problem with a fleshly answer. The
greatest danger to the Christian businessperson is his greatest
strength-his business acumen and expertise to get things done.
This self-reliance can become our greatest weakness when it comes
to moving in the spiritual realm. We're taught to be problem
solvers. But, like Moses, if our enthusiasm and passion are not
harnessed by the power of the Holy Spirit, we will fail
miserably. Peter had to learn this lesson too. His enthusiasm got
him into a lot of trouble. But God was patient, just as He is
patient with each of us. Sometimes He must put us in the desert
for a time in order to season us so that Christ is allowed to
reign supreme in the process.

Before you act, pray and seek the mind of Christ until you know
it is God behind the action. Check it out with others. You may
save yourself a trip to the desert.

Four Attributes of a Life God Blesses

So this is what the Sovereign Lord says: ""See, I lay a stone in
Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure
foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed.""
- (Isaiah 28:16)


Whenever God calls us into a consecrated life, it is made up of
four distinct stages. Christ often compared this process to
building a house. First, we must prepare to build by laying a
foundation. That foundation is none other than Jesus Christ
Himself. Any foundation other than Christ will not stand.

Second, as we enter a walk of faith with God, He allows each of
us to experience trials, testings, miracles, and challenges in
life that are designed to provide ""faith experiences"" that
demonstrate tangible evidences of His work in our life: Moses'
burning-bush experience, Peter's walk on the water, Joshua's
parting of the Jordan River. These experiences built the faith of
these people. The depth and width of our calling is directly
proportional to the faith experiences He allows in each of our
lives. If God plans an international ministry with you, chances
are you will experience a higher degree of faith experiences
compared to another. The reason is, you will need to look on
these to ensure your calling and provide testimony to His work in
your life.

The third stage deals with motives. ""All a man's ways seem
innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the Lord"" (Prov.
16:2). What is the motive behind my actions? Is it only financial
accumulation? Is it to gain control? Is it to create
independence? The primary motive must be God's leading you to
take such an action-it must be obedience. These other factors
must be by-products of the decision.

Finally, we are prepared to take action. Here we must ask, ""Do we
have the skill, quality, and ability to enter into this
activity?"" So often we have not trained ourselves adequately to
be successful in our endeavor. You would never want someone
working on your teeth who had not been trained and certified as a
dentist.

Before you begin your next project, ask yourself these four
questions. What is the foundation this project is based on? What
experiences has God demonstrated in my life that indicate His
involvement? What is my motive for entering this activity? Do I
have the skill, quality, and ability to accomplish the task?
Answering these questions will tell you whether God will bless
your activity.

"Curve Verification - Ercot","
The estate has been working with traders in order to validate curves.    We are also talking with brokers and reviewing Megawatt Daily archives.
Can I get some curve information from the Ercot team?   

  I have three specific dates to verify:  11/30, 12/3 and 12/30.
We are validating the marks for the daily, balmo, the prompt month and the cals.on the above mentioned dates.

Do you have this information?

I have talked to Peggy at APB.  She is willing to pass on info on the dailies,  but the historical data is something they want us to pay for.  I dont really need help with the daily stuff,  just the dates listed above.

I would appreciate any help that you can give,

JForney
Enron Estate Boy

The Fleshly Person

I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet
able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for
you are still fleshly. (1 Corinthians 3: 2,3).

The spirit of the fleshly person is identical to that of the
spiritual person. The fleshly person is a Christian, spiritually
alive in Christ and declared righteous by God. But that's where
the similarity ends. Instead of being directed by the Spirit,
this believer chooses to follow the impulses of his flesh. As a
result, his mind is occupied by carnal thoughts and his emotions
are plagued by negative feelings. And though he is free to choose
to walk after the Spirit and produce the fruit of the Spirit, he
continues to involve himself in sinful activity by willfully
walking after the flesh.

His physical body is a temple of God, but he is using it as an
instrument of unrighteousness. He has the same troubling physical
symptoms experienced by the natural person because he is not
operating in the manner God created him to operate. He is not
presenting his body to God as a living sacrifice. Since he yields
to the flesh instead of crucifying it, the fleshly man is also
subject to feelings of inferiority, insecurity, inadequacy,
guilt, worry, and doubt.

Several years ago I did some research to discover how many
Christians are still the victims of their flesh. I asked the same
question to 50 consecutive Christians who came to me to talk
about problems in their lives: ""How many of the following
characteristics describe your life: inferiority, insecurity,
inadequacy, guilt, worry, and doubt:"" Every one of the 50
answered, ""All six."" Here were 50 born-again, righteous children
of God who were so bogged down by the flesh that they struggled
with the same problems of self-doubt which inundate unbelivers
who only live in the flesh.

If I asked you the same question, how would you answer? I imagine
that many of you would admit that some or all of these six traits
describe you. It is evident to me that a staggering number of
believers are still confused about their spiritual identity in
Christ and its implications for their daily lives. We are
struggling with the behavior aspect of our growth because we are
still struggling with the belief aspect of our growth: who we are
in Christ.

Father, help me live above my fleshly desires today by exercising
my spiritual inheritance at every temptation.

EVALUATING YOUR PAST

It was for freedom that Christ set us free (Galatians 5:1).

How does God intend for you to resolve hurtful, controlling past
experiences? In two ways which we shall consider today and
tomorrow.

First, you have the privilege of evaluating your past experience
in the light of who you are now, as opposed to who you were then.
The intensity of the primary emotion was established by how you
perceived the event at the time it happened. Remember: Your
emotions are a product of how you perceived the event, not the
event itself. As a Christian, you are not primarily a product of
your past; you are primarily the product of the work of Christ on
the cross. The flesh, which represents how you processed those
events according to the world and without Christ, remains. But
you are able to render it inoperative.

When a present event activates that primary emotion, many people
believe what they feel instead of believing what is true. For
example, people who have been verbally abused by their parents
have a hard time believing they are unconditionally loved by
Father God. Their primary emotions argue that they are unlovable
to a parent figure. They believe what they feel and their walk is
off course. Believing the truth and walking by faith is what sets
us free.

Now that you are in Christ, you can look at those events from the
perspective of who you are today. Christ is in your life right
now desiring to set you free from your past. That is the gospel,
the good news that Christ has come to set the captives free.
Perceiving those events from the perspective of your new identity
in Christ is what starts the process of healing those damaged
emotions.

God's good news about our identity is revealed in 2 Corinthians
5:17: ""Therefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature;
the old things passed away; behold, new things have come."" This
is what you must believe first in order to be set free from your
past.

Loving Lord, thank You for making me a new creation in Christ.
Help me walk away from anything in my past that is restricting my
freedom.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

PROPHETIC MESSAGES

""Is not My word like fire?"" declares the LORD, and like a hammer
which shatters a rock?"" (Jeremiah 23:29).

If you attend a Christian fellowship where prophecies are part of
public worship, I wonder if we should expect from God generic
messages like, ""I love you, My children"" or ""I'm coming soon.""
These statements are certainly true, but why would they need to
be prophesied, since the Bible already clearly asserts God's love
and Christ's imminent return? I have heard ""prophecies"" like
these given in churches where many people were living in sin,
lulling them into an unrighteous complacency.

The voice of a prophet is a consuming fire and a shattering
hammer. A prophetic message should motivate people to
righteousness, not placate them in their sin (1 Peter 4:17). God
is more concerned about church purity than about church growth.
Comfort only comes to those who are persecuted for righteousness'
sake by allowing God's Word to purge their sin and shatter their
self-centeredness.

Jeremiah relates two other evidences of false prophets: ""'Behold,
I am against the prophets,' declares the LORD, 'who steal My
words from each other'"" (23:30). That's plagiarism: taking what
God gave someone else and using it as if it were your own. ""'I am
against the prophets,' declares the LORD, 'who use their tongues
and declare, ""the Lord declares""'"" (verse 31).

Declaring that what you are saying is directly from the Lord when
it isn't is an incredible offense to God. If God wants me to know
something He will tell me directly. I believe in the priesthood
of believers; however, God can and will encourage us and confirm
His Word to us through others. ""There is one God, and one
mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus"" (1
Timothy 2:5). If someone says to you ""God told me to tell you . .
."" that person may be functioning as a medium. The gift of
prophecy should reveal the secrets of the heart so people will
fall on their faces and worship God (1 Corinthians 14:25). Then
God will guide them by His Holy Spirit.

Lord, teach me not to quench Your Spirit nor to despise prophetic
utterances but to examine everything and hold fast to what is
good.

"MISO Losses - News and an Important Question","Good news.  It sounds like MISO will offer a way to handle losses financially.  Based on their previously filed tariff, it appeared that they would not, but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new Attachment M that details how they will handle losses financially.  I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine.

Now, for the Important Question.  MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15.  I don't think this is an issue for us (I expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules (dropping off losses along the path).

If this is not correct, and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions, please let me know ASAP.  Also let me know how prevalent that practice is.  MISO is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on Dec 15.  While they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline, they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem.

                  Marketplace Meditations
                       by Os Hillman

The Dangers of Overcontrol

For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like
the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the
Lord, He has rejected you as king.
- (1 Samuel 15:23)


A friend of mine who is a jet pilot once told me that whenever a
jet goes out of control and begins to spin, the only thing to do
is totally take your hands off the controls and the plane will
right itself. This goes against our natural inclination to
control and manipulate in order to bring things back under
control. It is scary to be out of control. Or is it?

Saul was a man out of control. He was losing control of his
kingdom to David. He was losing the favor of God and the people.
It began as compromises. Eventually he was given a final test to
obey the voice of God fully. He was instructed to kill the
Amalekites completely; but he failed to follow through. The
prophet Samuel delivered a hard word to King Saul, ""Because you
have rejected the word of the Lord, He has rejected you as king""
(see 1 Sam. 15:26). Saul obeyed partially, but not fully. It was
partial obedience that led to his removal as king of Israel and
his calling from God. But why did Saul do such a thing? ""I was
afraid of the people and so I gave in to them"" (1 Sam. 15:24b).
Saul's fear and insecurity made him more afraid of the people and
what they thought than of God. At the core of Saul's disobedience
was fear of losing control. That fear of losing control led to
partial obedience and the loss of his reign as king.

How many of us are in danger of losing God's blessing due to
partial obedience? How many of us have such a need to control
people and circumstances that we fail to fully walk in obedience
to God's voice in our lives? Saul provides a great lesson for us
as businesspeople. The need to overcontrol things around us can
prevent us from receiving all that God has for us. Today, take an
inventory of your control quotient.

Ask God if you are being fully obedient to what He has called you
to do this day, and avoid being put on the shelf for
disobedience. ""To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is
better than the fat of rams"" (1 Sam. 15:22b).

CHANGING DIRECTIONS

Guide me in Your truth and teach me, for You are God my Savior,
and my hope is in You all day long (Psalm 25:5 NIV).

The next five questions to ask yourself regarding God's will are
to help you when facing a change in direction.

  1 Is it reasonable? God expects us to think. His guidance may
    transcend human reasoning, but it never excludes it. God
    doesn't bypass our mind; He operates through it: ""Brethren,
    do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be babes,
    but in your thinking be mature"" (1 Corinthians 14:20). We are
    warned in Scripture not to put our mind in neutral. We are to
    think and practice what we know to be true (Philippians 4:8,
    9).

  2 Does a realistic opportunity exist? Closed doors are not
    meant to be knocked down. If you have a hopeless scheme, let
    it go. If it isn't God's timing, wait. If a realistic
    opportunity exists, and all the other factors are in
    agreement, then take the plunge. God may open a window of
    opportunity, but it will close if not taken advantage of. The
    faithless man asks, ""What do I stand to lose if I do?"" The
    faithful man asks, ""What do I risk losing if I don't?""

  3 Are unbiased, spiritually sensitive associates in agreement?
    Be careful not to consult only those who will agree with you.
    Give your advisors permission to ask hard questions. Don't be
    afraid of ""no"" answers. If it isn't God's will, don't you
    want to know before you make the mistake of acting
    impulsively?

  4 Do I have a sanctified desire? Don't think that being in the
    will of God must always be an unpleasant task. The joy of the
    Lord should be our strength. I find my greatest joy in
    serving God and being in His will. But don't get the idea
    that if everything is wonderful, you must be in the will of
    God. Is this a desire to satisfy a lust of the flesh or a
    Spirit-filled desire to see God's kingdom established and
    people helped?

  5 Do I have a peace about it? This is an inner peace. Is the
    peace of God guarding your heart and mind?

If you have been able to answer yes to all 10 of these deciding
factors, what are you waiting for?

Thank You, Lord, that I can trust You with the details and
direction of my life today.

DON'T BELIEVE IT

Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be
defiled by them (Leviticus 19:31).

Where do mediums and spiritists get their ""amazing"" information
and insights? Many of them are demonic channelers, but much of
what is called ""spiritism"" and ""psychic phenomena"" is no more
than clever illusion. hese so-called spiritists give what is
referred to as ""cold readings."" You go to them for advice or
direction, and they ask you a few simple, leading questions.
Based on the information you give, they make general observations
which are probably true of most people in your situation. But
you're so impressed with the accuracy of their ""revelations"" that
you start tipping them off to all kinds of details which they can
fabricate into their ""reading."" This is not demonic; it's just
mental and verbal sleight-of-hand.

But the mediums and spiritists that God warned against in
Leviticus and Deuteronomy were not con artists, but people who
possessed and passed on knowledge which didn't come through
natural channels of perception. These people have opened
themselves up to the spirit world and have become channels of
knowledge from Satan. The charlatan with his phony cold readings
is only interested in bilking you of your money. But the false
knowledge and direction which comes from Satan through a medium
is intended to bilk you of your spiritual vitality and freedom.

There's big money in psychic/con artist operations, and a lot of
magicians are raking it in. Many people crave to know something
extra about their lives and their future, and they will pay
handsomely if they think you can give them the inside information
they desire.

When a psychic claims to have contacted the dead, don't believe
it. When a psychologist claims to have regressed a client back to
a former existence through hypnosis, don't believe it. When a New
Age medium purports to channel a person from the past into the
present, realize that it is nothing more than a familiar spirit
or the fraudulent work of a con artist.

Lord Jesus, You are the way, the truth and the life. I renounce
any power or revelation from any other source than You.

LIVING WITH SIN'S CONSEQUENCES

Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the
wrath of God, for it is written, ""Vengeance is Mine, I will
repay,"" says the Lord (Romans 12:19).

Forgiveness does not mean that you must tolerate sin. Isabel, a
young wife and mother attending one of my conferences, told me of
her decision to forgive her mother for continually manipulating
her for attention. But Isabel tearfully continued, ""She is no
different. Am I supposed to let her keep ruining my life?""

No, forgiving someone doesn't mean that you must be a doormat to
their continual sin. I encouraged Isabel to confront her mother
lovingly but firmly, and tell her that she would no longer
tolerate destructive manipulation. It's okay to forgive another's
past sins and, at the same time, take a stand against future
sins. Forgiving is not a co-dependent activity.

Forgiveness does not demand revenge or repayment for offenses
suffered. ""You mean I'm just supposed to let them off the hook?""
you may argue. Yes, you let them off your hook, realizing that
they are not off God's hook. You may feel like exacting justice,
but you are not an impartial judge. God is the just Judge who
will make everything right (Romans 12:19). Your job is to extend
the mercy of forgiveness and leave judgment up to God.

Forgiveness is agreeing to live with the consequences of another
person's sin. Suppose that someone in your church says, ""I have
gossiped about you. Will you forgiven me?"" You can't retract
gossip any easier than you can put toothpaste back into the tube.
You're going to live with the gossip this person spread about you
no matter how you respond to the gossiper.

We are all living with the consequences of another person's sin:
Adam's. The only real choice we have in the matter is to live in
the bondage of bitterness or in the freedom of forgiveness.

Heavenly Father, I give up my right to seek revenge or harbor
resentment. I want to enjoy the freedom which comes from
forgiving others.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

The Skillful Worker

Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings;
he will not serve before obscure men.
- (Proverbs 22:29)


The Lord has called each of us to be excellent in what we do.
Those whom God used in the Kingdom as marketplace ministers were
skilled and exemplified excellence in their field. Not only were
these men skilled, they were filled with God's Spirit.

Then the Lord said to Moses, ""See, I have chosen Bezalel son of
Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, and I have filled him
with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all
kinds of crafts-to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver
and bronze, to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage
in all kinds of craftsmanship"" (Exodus 31:1-5).

Consider Huram, the master craftsman of bronze in whom Solomon
entrusted much of the temple designs. He was a true master
craftsman (see 1 Kings 7:14).

Consider Joseph, whose skill as an administrator was known
throughout Egypt and the world. Consider Daniel, who served his
king with great skill and integrity. The list could go on-David,
Nehemiah, Acquilla and Priscilla.

I recall the first issue of an international publication we
began. It was common to hear the comment, ""It doesn't even look
like a Christian magazine."" They were saying the quality and
excellence exceeded what they equated to Christian work. What a
shame. Has inferior quality become synonymous with Christian
work?

May we strive for excellence in all that we do for the Master of
the universe.

Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for
the Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an
inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you
are serving (Colossians 3:23-24).

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Author's Note * * * * * * *

How can you experience God in your work? Why do most of us
tend to segment our spiritual life from our work life? Can
I really know God's will for my life? How can I make
decisions that will be blessed by God? Why do most Christians
in the workplace live a defeated life? Join Os and Angie
Hillman for the Called to the Workplace one day workshop and
find these answers along with many more October 26,27 in

"Your Ameritrade Account  (KMM8302655V16068L0KM)","Dear Mr. King:

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to assist you today.  I have included the information to provide your network administrator in regards to your trouble with the Super StreamMachine.

Super StreamMachine uses a socket connection via the HTTP 1.0 protocol on port 80.  Upon initial connectivity we utilize standard HTTP headers to initiate the login and response.  It appears that there are certain caching engines that disallow this mechanism as they require all message packets to be HTTP 1.0 compliant. We do not send a full HTTP header on all messages and thus is being blocked by the cache engines.  You would either have to be able to get to our server directly without being routed through the cache engine or the cache engine tuned to allow non HTTP packet checking after the initial connection is generated.

Here is the IP address for Super StreamMachine:  204.107.120.3.  If your network administrator can check to see if this IP is being blocked by the cache server, this may be the answer to your problem.

If you have further concerns or inquiries, please reply to this message or call Client Services at (800) 669-3900 or (402) 970-5805.

Thank you for choosing Ameritrade!

Sincerely,

"MILITARY RESALE GROUP","MILITARY RESALE GROUP (OTC BB: BCTL)
Latest price: 98 cents


MILITARY RESALE GROUP, as a private company with limited
capital, grew 5 fold, breaking $5 Million in revenue.
MILITARY RESALE GROUP as BCTL, a public company, now has
greater access to capital. MILITARY RESALE GROUP last week
announced they have increased their space 3 times. Watch
for revenue to soar 3 - 5 times again.

Military Market Segment Is Hot.


MILITARY RESALE GROUP ADDS BAYER, A MAJOR BRAND, TO ITS
PRODUCT LINE

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.--Oct. 22, 2001--Military Resale
Group, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL) announced today that the Bayer
Corporation, a leader in the health and beauty aid
industry, has been added to its product supplier network.

Bayer is a very well recognized brand name in its market
categories, nationally and internationally. It is estimated
that sales of Bayer's products can add about $300,000
annually to revenues of Military Resale Group.

President Ethan D. Hokit commented: ``Military Resale Group
is pleased and complimented to have become able to
represent such a prestigious manufacturer as Bayer in our
distribution activities. We have previously forecast that
we expect MRG's sales to increase from $4.5 million in 2000
to reach $5.5 million over the next year. Bayer's new
presence is expected to make a major contribution to this
$1 million increase in annual sales that we foresee.''

Military Resale Group, Inc. was incorporated in 1997 when
it acquired a 50-year-old distributor to the Military
Resale Market. At that time, MRG's annual sales were
$750,000 and they have since soared five-fold in three
years to $4.5 million in 2000. Military Resale Group is now
a publicly owned company as a result of its recent
acquisition by Bactrol Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL).

The Military Resale Market is a $15 billion niche market,
with 13,000,000 authorized patrons, which operates under
the aegis of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), a
Department of Defense agency. The DOD's objective, in this
area, is to operate resale store systems, which sell
groceries (at commissaries) and general merchandise (at
exchanges, i.e., PXs) at the lowest possible prices. The
resulting average cost savings of about 25% are a major
fringe benefit (untaxed) to military personnel. The
competitive structure of the Military Resale Market
consists of a few large distributors, who do not dominate
the industry, and hundreds of small ones. The post-
acquisition strategy of MRG is to grow, primarily, by
acquiring other small distributors and, secondarily, by
internal growth.

accuracy of the information and for any omissions of
material facts. This advertisement may contain hyperlinks
to web sites operated by third parties other than us. Such
hyperlinks are provided for the reader's reference and
convenience only. We are not responsible for the
reliability of these external sites nor are we responsible
for any of the contents, advertising, products, or other
materials on such external sites. Our inclusion of
hyperlinks to such web sites does not imply any endorsement

goods, or services available on such external site. Any
concerns regarding any external link should be directed to
its respective site administrator or webmaster. We may
refer to other sources of information, or other commentary.
We intend to offer these items to readers as additional
sources of information, but disclaim any implication that
we endorse information contained in such outside sources.
Any referral by us is no guarantee of the accuracy of any
information provided by outside sources. As we disclaim any
representation concerning source reliability, readers must
contact information suppliers on their own and gauge to the
reader's satisfaction the truthfulness of any source
information. It should be understood that there is no
guarantee past performance will be indicative of future
results. Any reference to past performance(s) of companies
previously advertised are specially selected to be
referenced based on the favorable performance of these
companies and the companies referenced may not be
representative of all past advertised companies as not all
past advertised companies may have performed as well.
Readers are cautioned that small and micro-cap stocks are
high-risk investments and that they may lose all or a
portion of their investment if they make a purchase in our
advertised stocks. In order to be in full compliance with
the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(b), we have
received a total of 30,000 free trading shares of Military
Resale Group, Inc. from Xcel Associates, Inc. as
compensation for the distribution of this and other
advertisements. Since we have received compensation and
hold stock in the advertised company there is an inherent
conflict of interest in our statements and opinions and
such statements and opinions cannot be considered
independent. We will benefit from any increase in share
price of the advertised company. We will sell our shares at
any time, without notice, be that before, during or
immediately after the release of this advertisement. The
liquidation of our stock may have a negative impact on the
securities of the company liquidated, including decreased
market value and/or dilution of the company's securities.
Furthermore, our associates and/or employees and/or
principals may have stock positions in advertised companies
purchased in the open market or in private transactions.
These positions may be liquidated, without prior
notification, even after we have made positive comments
regarding the advertised company. It should be understood
that any price targets and/or projections mentioned are
solely opinions and should not be taken as suggested
holding periods. In fact, we will sell our positions in any
companies advertised before they reach such target prices.
The receipt of this information constitutes your acceptance
of these terms and conditions. Reading this advertisement
shall not create under any circumstances an offer to buy or
sell stock in any company advertised. Nor shall it create
any principal-agent relationship between the reader and us.
The stocks of advertised companies may trade in fast
moving, highly volatile markets, and any reader should
observe the trading behavior of any advertised company
prior to investing. Advertised stocks are often thinly
traded and large sell orders will have a substantially
negative impact on share price. Investors in advertised
stocks may experience difficulty in selling shares without
seeing a decline in market price and may have difficulty in
finding ready buyers of their stock. Information within
this advertisement contains ""forward looking"" statements
within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the U.S. Securities
Act of 1933 and Section 21(e) of the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Any statements that express or
involve discussions with respect to predictions,
expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives,
goals, assumptions or future events or performance are not
statements of historical facts and may be forward looking
statements. Forward looking statements are based on
expectations, estimates and projections at the time the
statements are made that involve a number of risks and
uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to
differ materially from those presently anticipated. Forward
looking statements may be identified through the use of
words such as expects, will, anticipates, estimates,
believes, or by statements indicating certain actions may,
could or might occur. We encourage our readers to invest
carefully and read the investor information available at
the web sites of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) at http://www.sec.gov and the National
Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) at
http://www.nasd.com. We also strongly recommend that you
read the SEC advisory to investors concerning Internet
Stock Fraud, which can be found at
http://www.sec.gov/consumer/cyberfr.htm. The NASD has
published information on how to invest carefully at its web
site. Readers can review all public filings by companies at
the SEC s EDGAR page. All information within this
advertisement is qualified in its entirety by the detailed
information and financial statements of the advertised
company contained in its regulatory filings with the SEC.

SAFETY, SECURITY AND BELONGING

My God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in
glory in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:19).

Not only was Adam given a significant, authoritative role at
creation, he also enjoyed a sense of safety and security. All his
needs were provided for (Genesis 1:29). Adam was completely cared
for in the garden. He had plenty to eat and there was plenty for
the animals. He could eat of the tree of life and live forever in
God's presence. He lacked nothing.

When Adam sinned, he lost that sense of safety and security.
Before, he was naked and unashamed. After, he wanted to hide from
God and cover up. The first emotion expressed by fallen humanity
was fear.

Safety and security is another facet of our inheritance in
Christ. We have the riches of His kingdom at our disposal and His
promise to supply all our needs.

Adam and Eve also experienced a sense of belonging in that
perfect garden. Adam apparently enjoyed intimate, one-on-one
communion with God before Eve was created. Then God said it was
not good for man to be alone (Genesis 2:18). So He gave Eve to
Adam--and Adam to Eve--to enrich his experience of belonging.

Before the Fall, Adam and Eve had a sense of belonging. But after
the Fall they felt rejected, experiencing a need to belong. It is
one of our greatest needs today. Notice that what were attributes
before the Fall became needs after the Fall.

I believe that a true sense of belonging today comes not only
from knowing that we belong to God, but also from belonging to
each other. When God created Eve He established human community.
It's not good for us to be alone. Aloneness can lead to
loneliness. God's preventative for loneliness is
intimacy--meaningful, open, sharing relationships with one
another. In Christ we have the capacity for the fulfilling sense
of belonging which comes from intimate fellowship with God and
with other believers.

Lord, thank You that all my needs for safety, security and
belonging are fully met in You.

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

"Employee Referral Program","


	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

"FROM CINDY OLSON, COMMUNITY RELATIONS: Body Shop Reopening","Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.)
The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below:  

	   

The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. 
Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047.  
Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002.
Your continued support is greatly appreciated.

N E I L   A N D E R S O N   D A I L Y   D E V O T I O N A L
             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

January 23

DEALING WITH THE DARK WORLD

The Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall
away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons (1 Timothy 4:1).

A few years ago I was speaking in a Southern California church on
the subject of the New Age Movement. My text was 1 Timothy 4:1.
After my message, I was surrounded at the front of the sanctuary
by people wanting to hear more about freedom from spiritual
conflicts caused by demonic influences.

Sitting about halfway back in the sanctuary was a 22-year-old
woman who had been weeping uncontrollably since the service
ended. As I approached the young woman, I could hear her sobbing,
""He understands! He understands!""

later Nancy described to me her horrible childhood, which
included an abusive father and a grandmother who identified
herself as a black witch. ""When I was three years old, I received
my guardians--spirit guides,"" she continued. ""They were my
companions, telling me how to live and what to say. I never
questioned if having spirit guides was anything but normal until
my mother took me to Sunday school.""

""Would you like to get rid of your spirit guides?"" I asked.

There was a long pause. ""Will they really leave, or will I go
home and be thrashed by them again?""

""You will be free,"" I assured her. An hour later Nancy was free.

Nancy's experience is not an obscure, erratic blip in the
contemporary Christian community. In face, in more than 20 years
of ministry as a pastor, counselor, seminary professor and
conference speaker, I have met and ministered to more Christians
in bondage to the dark side of the spiritual world than you may
believe. Christians are woefully unprepared to deal with the dark
world of Satan's kingdom or to minister to those who are in
bondage to it.

Yes, as Timothy warned, ""deceitful spirits and doctrines of
demons"" are real. But as you daily embrace Christ and His truth,
you will be able to recognize Satan's lies and choose the truth.

Thank You, Jesus, for being the way, the truth, and the life. I
know You are my weapon for overcoming the evil one.

"TGIF Marketplace Meditation -- The Purpose of Crucibles","T O D A Y    G O D    I S    F I R S T
                  Marketplace Meditations
                       by Os Hillman

The Purpose of Crucibles

The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord
tests the heart.
- (Proverbs 17:3)


This proverb describes one of God's strangest mysteries. It is a
description of God's formula to refine the human heart in order
to bring out its finest qualities. The significant leaders who
make the greatest mark for the Kingdom had to experience their
own crucible and fire. Without it, the dross can never be removed
from the human heart. Without it, the encumbrances weigh us down.
God understands the human heart. He understands that for us to
become all that He hopes for us, there are seasons of fire.
Joseph went through many tests. Succeeding in the test qualified
him for greater responsibility. The greater the use in the
Kingdom the greater the crucible to prepare the right foundation.
Some of God's greatest crucibles are found in the marketplace
where we live every day: the employee who betrays our trust, the
client who refuses to pay, the vendor who falls short of our
expectations.

Each of these is God's tests to find out how we will respond.
What tests are being brought your way today? His grace has been
provided that we might pass the tests that He brings before us.
Should we fail, we need not fear. His grace is sufficient for
this as well. Ask God for the grace to walk with Him in whatever
tests He has placed before you this day. He is able to accomplish
what He wants for you.

"Membership rewards announcement - Pls distribute 1/18/02","AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.

Weapons of Warfare

Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into
spears.
- (Joel 3:10)


In this third chapter of Joel, we hear the prophet describe a
time yet to come. It will be a time of great harvest on the
earth, and this verse describes the catalyst. A plowshare is an
agricultural instrument used to till the soil. At this point in
history, it was a tool that spoke of one's vocation. However, the
prophet was speaking of a time yet to come. The prophet described
the plowshare as an instrument that will be turned into a sword.
The sword is often used in the Bible to describe God's Word. The
only way a plowshare can be turned into a sword is for it to go
through extreme heat, and then the blacksmith must beat that
plowshare into shape. Heat and punishment of the metal turns that
plowshare into an instrument of battle. God must do this in each
of our lives in order for us to be useable as a worthy sword. We
are all in a battle-a spiritual battle. Paul describes our battle
as one against the principalities of the unseen world. I believe
God is going to raise up many in the marketplace to use their
plowshare as a weapon of righteousness in these last days. That
weapon won't be used for destruction, but as a weapon of love.
That weapon of love will yield a great harvest in our lifetime.
But this is only part of the story.

God is also going to turn our pruning hooks into spears. A
pruning hook is used in two ways. First, it is used to prune a
tree for greater growth and productivity. It is also used to cut
the fruit from taller trees in which one cannot reach the fruit.
This fruit from our vocation is going to be cast forth like a
spear, but even more as seed planted to bring the harvest of
which Joel speaks. Fruit from our business life is often the
financial rewards generated. God wants to use our finances and
everything else for His purposes. We must use our vocations and
the fruit that comes from them as seed to bring the great harvest
that God is planning.

How are you using your plowshare and your pruning hook for God's
glory today? Ask God to show you how He wants to use your skills,
resources, and relationships to prepare for the great harvest He
has planned.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

October 23

EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE

The troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring me out of my
distresses (Psalm 25:17).

Unlike our day-to-day emotions which are the product of our
day-to-day thought life, emotional baggage from the past is
always there. Years of exposure and experience in life have
etched grooves in our memory banks which are triggered by current
events.

For example, if your kind, loving grandfather was named Bill, you
probably have a favorable emotional reaction to other people
named Bill. But if the school bully was named Bill, your initial
reaction to the Bills in your life is probably negative. If your
spouse suggests, ""Let's name our first child Bill,"" you might
even react, ""Over my dead body!""

I call these long-term emotions which lurk beneath the surface
primary emotions. The intensity of your primary emotions is
determined by your previous life history. The more traumatic your
experience, the more intense will be your primary emotion. Many
of these primary emotions will lie dormant and have very little
effect on your life until something comes along to trigger them.
Have you ever brought up a topic of conversation which upset
someone and sent him storming out of the room? ""What set him
off?"" you wondered. He was ""set off"" because a bad experience in
his past was triggered by your topic. The trigger is any present
event which he associates with the past conflict.

Most people try to control their primary emotions by avoiding the
people or events which trigger them. But you can't isolate
yourself completely from everything which may set off a response.
You are bound to see something on TV or hear something in a
conversation which will bring to mind your unpleasant experience.
You must learn how to resolve previous conflicts or the emotional
baggage will accumulate and the past will control your life.

During the next few days, we will consider ways to resolve our
emotional baggage from the past.

Lord, I don't want to be controlled by past events. Show me how I
can resolve these issues so I can walk in freedom today.

Fellas,

Presto has asked me to be the contact to Allan Stewart at PIRA with regard to setting up an arrangement for their consulting services.  I'm currently having information-gathering discussions over services and fees for both gas and power, in both the east and west.  In order to fully incorporate everyone's needs into our arrangement with PIRA, I'll be contacting you this week to gather requests.  Or, if you know what you need, please just reply to me with the specific information.

Thanks,

Fletch

WITH ALL PRAYER AND PETITION

With all prayer and petition, pray at all times in the Spirit,
and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and
petition for all the saints (Ephesians 6:18).

The mother of one of my seminary students was a psychic. She said
to him once, ""Jim, have you been praying for me?"" ""Of course I
have, Mother."" ""Well, don't,"" she insisted, ""because you're
disturbing my aura.""

I say pray on! We never know completely the effects of our
prayers, but we do know that God includes prayer as part of His
strategy for establishing His kingdom and ensuring our spiritual
victory.

One of the most dramatic deliverances I have observed happened in
a man who was a high priest in the upper echelons of Satanism.
Six months after he was set free he gave his testimony in our
church. At the close of his testimony I asked him, ""Based on your
experience on 'the other side,' what is the Christian's greatest
strategy against demonic influence?""

""Prayer,"" he answered forcefully. ""And when you pray, mean it.
Fervent prayer thwarts Satan's activity like nothing else.""

What is prayer? It is communication with God by which we express
our dependence on Him. God knows what we need in our battle with
the powers of darkness, and He is more ready to meet our needs
than we are to ask. But until we express our dependence on Him in
prayer, God may not act. In prayer we say, ""You are the Lord, not
I. You know what's best; I don't. I'm not telling You what to do;
I'm asking."" Prayer is a means by which God guides and protects
His children.

Praying in the Spirit is God's way of helping us pray when we
don't know how: ""The Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do
not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself
intercedes for us"" (Romans 8:26). Helps (sunantilambano) depicts
the Holy Spirit's role of coming alongside us in our condition of
human frailty and spiritual vulnerability and bearing us to the
other side of spiritual protection and victory.

Thank You, Lord, that prayer is such a powerful weapon in my
arsenal against the powers of darkness.

RECKLESS ABANDON

I do not want you to become sharers in demons (1 Corinthians
10:20).

While Christians have been questioning the reality of demonic
influence in the church, the world has charged into the spiritual
realm with reckless abandon. The Western world is experiencing a
massive paradigm shift in its worldview, as best seen in the rise
of the New Age Movement, the acceptance of parapsychology as a
science, the growing popularity of the supernatural, and the
increasing visibility of Satanism in our culture. New Age
mysticism, which gathered its greatest strength with the influx
of Eastern religions in the 1960s, has been popularized by a host
of celebrities in the 1980s. It's commonplace to hear channelers
(mediums) on radio and TV talk shows boasting about their spirit
guides (demons).

But the New Age Movement is not just a celebrity issue. New Age
philosophy is making significant inroads into business, education
and even religion across our nation. Recently I challenged two my
students to attend, for the sake of research, a New Age
conference being held two blocks from our school. When they
arrived at the door and discovered the cost to be $65 each, they
started to walk away. But two strangers approached them saying,
""We were told to give you these tickets."" My wide-eyed students
took the tickets and walked in.

They reported to me that one of the speakers led conference
participants in a meditation exercise. He challenged everyone to
imagine a spirit guide coming alongside. The speaker concluded
the exercise by saying, ""Now invite your spirit guide to come
in."" I could hardly believe it. The devil is giving altar calls
just two blocks from Biola University!

Does the spread of New Age and the occult worry you or frighten
you? It need not. In Christ you have every resource to defuse and
dispel any threat of darkness in your life or family. Stand on
the truth of His Word and walk in the light of your identity in
Christ.

Keep me alert today, Lord, to inroads the devil is attempting in
my world that I may tear down his strongholds with the weapons of
the Spirit.

"FW: Move Related Issues","

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

THE EFFECTS OF THE FALL

Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because
all sinned (Romans 5:12).

Unfortunately, the idyllic setting in the Garden of Eden was
shattered. Genesis 3 tells the sad story of Adam and Eve's lost
relationship with God through sin. The effects of man's fall were
dramatic, immediate and far-reaching, infecting every subsequent
member of the human race.

What happened to Adam and Eve spiritually because of the Fall?
They died. Their union with God was severed and they were
separated from God. God had specifically said: ""You must not eat
from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat
of it you will surely die"" (Genesis 2:17 NIV). They ate and they
died.

Did they die physically? No. The process of physical death was
set in motion, but they were alive physically for several hundred
more years. They died spiritually; their souls were separated
from God. They were banished from God's presence. They were cast
out of the Garden of Eden and guarding the entrance were cherubim
waving a flaming sword (Genesis 3:23, 24).

After Adam, everyone who comes into the world is born physically
alive but spiritually dead, separated from God. Paul wrote, ""As
for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which
you used to live"" (Ephesians 2:1 NIV).

How did Jesus remedy this problem? In two dramatic, life-changing
ways. First, He died on the cross to cure the disease that caused
us to die: sin. Romans 6:23 begins, ""The wages of sin is death.""
Then He rose from the dead to give us spiritual life. The verse
continues, ""But the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ
Jesus our Lord."" Jesus Himself said, ""I came that they might have
life"" (John 10:10).

The bad news is that , as a child of Adam, you inherited
spiritual death. But the eternally good news is that, as a child
of God through faith in Christ, you will live forever because of
the life He has provided for you.

Thank You, heavenly Father, for sending Jesus to die on the cross
for my sins and then raising Him from the dead so I may have
life.

A Man Who Has God's Favor

""...Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with
you.""
- (Zechariah 8:23)


Few men of God have become extraordinary people of faith without
the influence of mentors. A mentor is one who takes
responsibility for the spiritual and, sometimes, physical care of
another. It requires a commitment from the teacher and the
student.

Elijah mentored Elisha. Elisha became one of the greatest
prophets in all the Bible. One of the primary reasons for this
was Elisha's hunger. Elisha wanted a double portion of Elijah's
spirit. It was this hunger that drove Elisha to be sold out to
God's purposes for his life.

I have been privileged to have had many mentors throughout my
spiritual life. In each stage of my maturity, God brought new
mentors who had unique gifts that the previous mentor did not
have. God has given me the hunger to desire a double portion of
those positive attributes of my mentors. This desire is sorely
missing among many today. I fail to see the hunger among many who
could be used greatly in the Kingdom. Instead, they get
distracted by the cares of this world. It is an attitude of a la
carte versus an attitude of pressing in to the full measure of
what God might have for them.

Who are the people of God He has placed in your life? Are you
learning from them? Are you seeking a double portion of their
anointing? What prevents you from gaining from their wisdom and
experience? God may have brought them into your life to prepare
you to be a man or woman of God with great anointing. However,
there is a time of training and waiting to prove out your own
faith. Ask God today if there is someone He would have you mentor
or be mentored by.

"MISO Losses - MORE News","After talking further with MISO folks about the new attachment M, it appears that the MISO will _effectively_ be requiring physical losses, although they don't come out and say that. Financial losses are essentially at the option of the TO, so we ""may"" be able to do Financial losses if the TOs want to offer the service.

In more detail, this is how the process will work:

TCs will use the MISO's loss calculator to identify impacted TOs
If ALL TOs have provided financial loss pricing information, then it will be possible to buy losses
If not, the TC will be required to self supply

TOs can change their loss pricing (or desire to offer financial losses) every 12 hours.  Effectively, this means it will be difficult at best to manage risk associated with having the FIN rug pulled out from under us at scheduling time.  I will continue to work on this issue with Mike  and push for a financial solution that provides for our needs.

"NetcoOnline Launch Plans","
We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas

SING AND MAKE MELODY

Be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and
hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your
heart to the Lord (Ephesians 5:18, 19).

How pathetically unaware we are of the biblical prominence of
music in the spiritual realm. It is interesting to note that
whenever the evil spirit came upon King Saul, David (the heir
apparent to Israel's throne) would play his harp and the evil
spirit would depart (1 Samuel 16:23). When Elisha was about to
inquire of God, he said, ""'Now bring me a minstrel.' And it came
about, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came
upon him"" (2 Kings 3:15). During the reign of David, more than
4000 musicians were assigned to sing in the temple night and day
(1 Chronicles 9:33; 23:5). It is the mark of Spirit-filled
Christians to sing and make melody in their hearts to the Lord
and speak to each other in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs
(Ephesians 5:18, 19).

On the other side of the truth lies the destructive power of
secular music. A former satanic high priest showed me numerous
symbols on popular record albums indicating commitment and
bondage to Satanism. He told me that about 85 percent of today's
heavy metal and punk music groups are ""owned"" by Satanists. They
have unwittingly sold themselves to Satanism in exchange for fame
and fortune. Few of these artists actually practice Satanism, but
most are hopelessly lost and lead others astray through the
godless message in their music.

God created sound and formed our bodies to respond to it. Our
ears pick up the sound around us and send a signal to the brain.
Some sounds irritate us; others soothe us. There is music that
makes you want to march and music that puts you to sleep. Even
without lyrics, music with harmony and order can affect the
nervous system positively while discord produces a negative
effect.

What role does music play in your life? Are you filling your mind
and home with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs? Or are you
allowing destructive secular music to rob you of your joy and
vitality in the Lord?

You are the God who sings over me, Lord. Thank You for the gift
of music and for the songs You give me in the night.

THE ESSENCE OF TEMPTATION

For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our
weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are,
yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15).

I have found that many Christians struggle with the distinction
between temptation and sin. Bombarded by tempting thoughts, they
conclude that there must be something pretty sick about them. But
even Jesus was ""tempted in all things as we are."" But finish the
verse: ""Yet without sin."" As long as we are in the world, we are
exposed to temptation just like Jesus was. But He didn't sin, and
we don't have to sin either (1 Corinthians 10:13).

The basis for temptation is legitimate human needs. We will
either look to the world, the flesh and the devil to have our
needs met, or we will look to Christ who promises to meet our
needs (Philippians 4:19). The essence of temptation is the
invitation to live independently of God.

The power of temptation depends on the strength of the
strongholds which have been developed in our minds as we learned
to live independently of God. If you were raised in a Christian
home where magazines and television programs of questionable
moral value were not allowed, the power of sexual temptation in
your life will not be as great as for someone who grew up exposed
to pornographic materials. Why? Because your legitimate need to
be loved and accepted was met by parents who also protected you
from exposure to illegitimate means of meeting your needs. The
person who grew up in an environment of immorality may experience
a greater struggle with sexual temptation simply because that
stronghold in the mind was well-established before he was born
again.

Jesus was tempted to meet His own physical needs by using His
divine attributes independently of the Father to turn a rock into
bread. But instead He responded, ""Man shall not live on bread
alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God""
(Matthew 4:4). We also must respond to temptation by relying on
God to meet our needs.

Dear Jesus, help me not to listen to the voice of the tempter
today but to run to You as the source for meeting all my needs.

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of ""icap"" as a product (including any ""reserve type"" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on ""Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets.""

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

Standing in the Gap

I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and
stand before Me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not
have to destroy it, but I found none.
- (Ezekiel 22:30)


The people of Israel fell into sin when they worshiped the golden
calf. It would not be the last time God's people would fall into
idol worship. They had forgotten the great things God had done
for them. This angered God so much that He was going to destroy
the whole nation. Only one thing changed God's mind in the
matter-Moses. Psalm 106:23 says, ""...had not Moses, His chosen
one, stood in the breach before Him to keep His wrath from
destroying them."" Moses was a man willing to stand in the gap,
sacrificially, for those who were not deserving of such
sacrifice. This sacrificial love by Moses is called for among His
people today.

The prophet Ezekiel described another situation in which God's
people fell into sin. God was ready to destroy the nation when He
spoke to Ezekiel, asking him if there is a man willing to stand
in the gap so that God would not have to destroy His people.

Judah was a man who stood in the gap on behalf of his younger
brother Benjamin. Joseph held his brother Simeon hostage as
insurance that the other brothers would bring Benjamin to Egypt.
Judah had a long history of a me-focused life, but in this
instance he came forward to stand in the gap for his younger
brother. He responded to the anguish of his father, Jacob, by
personally guaranteeing the safe return of both Simeon and
Benjamin. Judah's sacrifice was rewarded (see Gen. 42-43).

Just as Christ did, we are to be those who will stand in the gap
on behalf of others who are not aware of their own vulnerable
condition. It is a proactive sacrificial position. Who is God
calling you to stand in the gap for? Perhaps it is a mate;
perhaps it is a business associate who has not come to know the
Savior; perhaps it is a wayward child. Are you willing to become
the sacrificial offering to God to change His plans of judgment
because of your willingness to stand in their place? This is a
hard teaching. This is what Jesus did for each of us. When we
stand in the place of another, God moves because of our
willingness to stand on their behalf. If we don't, His plans will
go forward because He is a righteous and holy God who will honor
His own word, even if it means destruction. Are you willing to
stand in the breach of the wall for someone today? Perhaps you
are the only person who will stand on someone's behalf.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

SEEKING GOD'S FACE

My heart says of you, ""Seek His face!"" Your face, LORD, I will
seek (Psalm 27:8 NIV).

""If the sun is shining in the morning, I'll do it."" ""If he's
there when I open the door, I'll know he's the one."" ""If I pass
the class on world missions, I'll be a missionary. If not, I'll
be a local pastor.""

We all know better than this, but it's amazing how often
scenarios just like these pop into our minds. Such propositions
are referred to as ""laying a fleece"" before the Lord or ""seeking
a sign.""

The term fleece comes from the account of Gideon. In Judges 6,
Gideon is called by God to deliver Israel from the Midianites.
Gideon questions whether God is even for Israel (verse 13), and
he doubts his own ability (verse 15). So he asks God for a sign
(verse 17). God gives him one, then tells him to tear down the
altar of Baal. Gideon is afraid to go during the day, so he goes
at night.

Then he questions again whether God will deliver Israel. This
time he puts a lamb's fleece on the ground. If God will deliver
Israel, then the lamb's fleece will be wet in the morning and the
ground around it will be dry. The next morning it is so. That
ought to satisfy him, right? Wrong! Wanting to be sure, and
hoping that God won't get too mad, Gideon asks Him to do it
again, but this time with the opposite result (i.e., the fleece
dry and the ground wet). Not exactly the stuff heroes are made
of. But God answers Gideon's request and then He reduces Gideon's
army down to 300 men!

The whole point of the passage is that God, not man, is the
deliverer. God chose a man desperately seeking assurance and
reduced an army down to nothing so that the victory would clearly
be His. The fleece wasn't a means of demonstrating faith; it was
just the opposite. And it certainly wasn't used to determine
God's will. God had already told Gideon what to do. Gideon was
questioning the integrity of God, just as we do if we ask for a
fleece when God has already shown us His will. ""An evil and
adulterous generation craves for a sign"" (Matthew 12:39). As
God's people, let's seek the face of God.

Lord, forgive me for the times I have looked for sign instead of
seeking Your face. I commit myself today to walk only in the
faith revealed in Your Word.

Your Work

I have brought You glory on earth by completing the work You gave
Me to do.
- (John 17:4)


The Lord has revealed to us that the number one thing we are to
do is love the Lord our God with all our heart and to love our
neighbor as ourselves. His desire is for us to know Him and the
power of His resurrection. These mandates deal with our
relationship with Him. The fruit of this relationship must then
result in our glorifying Him by completing the work He has given
each of us to do. It will become a by-product of this
relationship, not an end in itself.

What is the work God has called you to do? Jesus never did
anything the Father had not instructed Him to do. He lived in
such communion with the Father that He knew when to turn left and
when to turn to the right. Is it possible to have such a
relationship with our heavenly Father? I think that if it
weren't, He would not have given us such an example.

""Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and
unsearchable things you do not know"" (Jer. 33:3). What has He
called you to do? Perhaps you are called to be the best CPA in
your city or the best advertising executive or the best office
worker or assembly-line person in your company. Whatever work He
has called you to do, He will use you as His instrument to
accomplish something that He has uniquely prepared you to do.

When our life is complete, what a glorious day it will be if we
can each say, ""I have completed the work You gave me to do."" This
will have brought great glory to Him.

Impossible Tasks

But He answered, ""You give them something to eat.""
- (Mark 6:37)


Has anyone ever asked you to do something that seems totally
ridiculous? The very suggestion of their instruction may have
brought laughter or even anger for proposing the idea.

I imagine that the disciples may have felt this way when Jesus
responded with this comment when they asked him how they were
going to feed the 5000 who stayed around to hear him speak. The
disciples suggested a logical answer to the problem, ""Send the
people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and
villages and buy themselves something to eat"" (Mk 6:36).

That wasn't the answer Jesus wanted. He saw the need of the
people. He had compassion on them. He wanted to solve the problem
with a Kingdom response, not logic. He asked them what they had
in their hand.

So often what we already have in our hand is what Jesus wants us
to use to solve our problems. We must add faith to what we
already have in our hand. Then we will see the gospel of the
Kingdom manifested to solve problems in a supernatural way. Jesus
wanted to meet a need in which God would receive the glory.
Sending the people away did not meet the need, nor did it bring
glory to the Father.

Do not settle for the gospel of salvation only. Jesus came that
we might experience the gospel of the Kingdom in its fullest
sense. Our job is to look past our logical reasoning and see how
God might want to solve our problem in a supernatural way.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"NOTICE TO: All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan","TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

    plans; we're supposed to ask God for His plans.

  2 Is it consistent with the Word of God? In our culture,
    ignorance of God's Word is no excuse since resources abound.
    I believe that every home should have at least a concordance,
    a Bible dictionary, a topical Bible, a good commentary, and a
    study Bible with notes. Most pastors would love to share what
    God has to say about a given matter. If they wouldn't, you
    have called the wrong pastor!

  3 Can I do it and be a positive Christian witness? A seminary
    student stopped by my office and told me about a job he had
    been offered. It would take care of his financial needs, but
    he had some reservations concerning the sales pitch he was
    required to use. I asked him if he could use the sales
    technique and be a positive witness for Christ. He didn't
    take the job.

  4 Will the Lord be glorified? Can I do this and give glory to
    God? In doing it, would I be glorifying God in my body? Am I
    seeking the glory of man or the glory of God? Am I doing this
    to be noticed by man or am I seeking to please the Lord?

  5 Am I acting responsibly? God doesn't bail us out of our
    irresponsibility. But when we are faithful in little things,
    He will put us in charge of greater things. Don't get ahead
    of God's timing or you will be over your head in
    responsibilities. Seek to develop your life and message, and
    God will expand your ministry.

Dear Lord, help me take a good, hard look at these questions and
then avoid at all costs any compromise with Your will in my life
today.

N E I L   A N D E R S O N   D A I L Y   D E V O T I O N A L
             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

February 2

A RADICAL, INNER TRANSFORMATION

By the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did
not prove vain (1 Corinthians 15:10).

If you believe that you are part light and part darkness, part
saint and part sinner, you will live in a very mediocre manner
with little to distinguish you from the non-Christian. You may
confess your proneness to sin and strive to do better, but you
will live a continually defeated life because you perceive
yourself to be only a sinner saved by grace who is hanging on
until the rapture. Satan knows he can do nothing about who you
really are, but if he can get you to believe you are no different
from the natural person, then you will behave no differently from
the natural person.

Why does this profile describe so many Christians? Because we are
ignorant of our true identity in Christ. God's work of atonement
in changing sinners to saints is His greatest accomplishment on
earth. The inner change, justification, is effected at the moment
of salvation. The outer change in the believer's daily walk,
sanctification, continues throughout life. But the progressive
work of sanctification is only fully effective when the radical,
inner transformation of justification is realized and
appropriated by faith.

""But didn't I read somewhere that Paul referred to himself as the
chief of sinners?"" you may wonder. Yes, but he was referring to
his nature before his conversion to Christ (1 Timothy 1:12-16).
He made a similar statement of self-depreciation in 1 Corinthians
15:9, but continued by saying: ""But by the grace of God I am what
I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain"" (verse 10).
Paul knew that who he was before Christ and who he became in
Christ were two separate identities.

If you claim to be just a sinner, what will you do? You will sin!
You are professing that sin is at the core of your identity.
That's not what the Bible teaches. Why don't we just believe God
that Jesus is at the core of our being and then begin to live
like it by His Spirit?

Thank You, Father, that I am complete in Your Son Jesus and that
my identity is rooted in Him and not in my sin.

Paneled Houses

""Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled
houses, while this house remains a ruin?""
- (Haggai 1:4)


There is a crisis of grand proportions in the spiritual house of
God today. The moral fiber of our world has eroded. Greed,
idolatry, and pleasure are the gods of our day. And it is no
different in the Body of Christ.

The prophet Haggai wrote about a people who had lost concern for
the need to build God's house because they were so focused on
their own worldly needs. It is a dangerous place to get with God.
When our world begins to focus around increasing our pleasure,
building bigger and better homes, and failing to make what is
important to God important in our own lives, this should be a
warning to us.

Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying
and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers
and the benches of those selling doves. ""It is written,"" He said
to them, "" 'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you
are making it a 'den of robbers' "" (Matthew. 21:12-13).

Jesus came into Jerusalem and found the businesspeople buying and
selling in the temple. As far as they knew, this was an
acceptable practice in their day. Their fathers did it, and now
they were doing it. It was business as usual. Jesus got angry,
turned over the tables, and said that His house was a house of
prayer. He found the businesspeople of the day seeing His house
as a place for profit, not prayer. They had stepped into a place
of complacency that was not acceptable to the Lord. When we begin
to blend in with the moral condition of an ungodly world, we
begin losing God's perspective on life.

It is easy to begin blending in with our culture and to accept
what is being modeled by the ungodly. God called us to be salt in
a world that needs much salt. ""You are the salt of the earth. But
if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?
It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and
trampled by men"" (Mt. 5:13). Each of us must ask ourselves if we
have lost our salt. Are we having an impact on our world? Or is
our world having an impact on us? Ask God to give you a vision
for how you can be salt to your world today.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

November 18

THE OLDEST LIE OF SATAN

They sacrificed to demons who were not God, to gods whom they
have not known, new gods who came lately, whom your fathers did
not dread. You neglected the Rock who begot you, and forgot the
God who gave you birth (Deuteronomy 32:17, 18).

The New Age Movement cloaks the occult in the description of New
Age enlightenment: ""You don't need God; you are God. You don't
need to repent of your sins and depend on God to save you. Sin
isn't a problem; you just need to turn off your mind and tune in
to the great cosmic oneness through harmonic convergence."" The
New Age pitch is the oldest lie of Satan: ""You will be like God""
(Genesis 3:5).

This thirst for knowledge and power has lured a fallen humanity
to seek guidance from mediums and spiritists, and from such
occultic practices as fortune-telling, tarot cards, palm-reading,
Ouija boards, astrology, magic charming and automatic writing.
People all around us are ignoring the God who loves them and
wants to guide their lives and are instead seeking light and
peace in the kingdom of darkness. Peace can only be found in the
Prince of Peace, not in the prince of darkness.

Don't be carried away by the prospect of knowledge and power
which is luring so many people in our culture today away from
God. People such as the devotees of Simon in Acts 8:9, 10, will
continue to be astonished by those who practice New Age sorcery.
Others, such as the customers of the demon-possessed slave girl
in Acts 16:16-18, will contribute to the profit of those who
exercise a spirit of divination. As in these examples from the
early church, those who seek knowledge and power from the dark
side will greatly interfere with the work of God, deceiving many
by the counterfeit forces they employ. Other people will thirst
after power to such an extent that they will sacrifice to the
""goat demons"" (Leviticus 17:7) and even sacrifice their own
children to demons (Psalm 106:36-38).

Let the words of Deuteronomy 32:17, 18, sober us to the reality
that even believers are vulnerable to being lured away from the
knowledge and power of God by our enemy.

Lord, I refuse to participate with the powers of darkness. You
are my life and the light of my world.

DEAD TO SIN

Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God
in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal
body that you should obey its lusts (Romans 6:11, 12).

Sin is the condition into which all descendants of fallen Adam
are born (Romans 5:12). Sin is living our lives independently of
God. It's the result of being deceived by Satan to believe that
meaning and purpose in life may be achieved apart from a personal
relationship with, and obedience to, the Creator of life
(Deuteronomy 30:19, 20; 1 John 5:12). In the non-Christian, sin
permeates the old nature, dominates the old self, and perpetuates
the deeds of the flesh. Satan is at the heart of all sin (1 John
3:8). He deceives people into believing a lie and counsels them
to rebel against God.

When you received Christ you died to sin and its power to
dominate you was broken. Satan and sin have not died; they are
still strong and appealing. But you no longer have to sin because
you are dead to sin and alive to God in Christ (Romans 6:11). You
are not dead to sin because you consider it so; you consider it
so because it is so. In Christ you have already died to sin.

Paul goes on to say that we are not to use our bodies as
instruments of unrighteousness (verse 13). If we do, we allow sin
to rule in our mortal bodies. For example, it is virtually
impossible for someone to commit a sexual sin and not use his
body as an instrument of unrighteousness, allowing sin to rule.
Ask the Lord to reveal to your mind how you have wrongly used
your body, especially sexually. Renounce that wrong use and then
submit your body to God as a living sacrifice. It is your
responsibility not to let ""sin reign in your mortal body that you
should obey its lusts"" (Romans 6:12).

Loving Lord, I know that sin's power over me has been broken.
Help me live today in the light of that truth by renouncing sin
and submitting my body to You.

When God Seems Far Away

Why, O Lord, do You stand far off? Why do You hide Yourself in
times of trouble?
- (Psalms 10:1)


One of the great mysteries of God is His ways. Some of His ways
almost appear to bring us into the most difficult places, as if
He were indifferent to our circumstances. It would appear that He
is turning His head from our sorrows. These events in our lives
have a particular objective to perform for us. That objective is
to bring us to the end of ourselves that we might discover the
treasure of darkness. ""Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when
I looked for light, then came darkness"" (Job 30:26).

When we are taken into these dark periods, we begin to see light
that we never knew existed. Our sensitivities become heightened
and our ability to see through spiritual eyes is illuminated.
Unless we are taken into these times, our souls never develop any
depth of character. We do not gain wisdom, only knowledge.
Knowledge is gained through understanding; wisdom is gained
through the experience of darkness.

After we go through these periods, we discover that God was, in
fact, with us throughout the entire time. It does not feel or
appear that He is there when we are in the midst of the dark
periods. However, He is there walking with us. He has told us
countless times that He will never leave us. However, when we are
in those dark periods, it does not feel like He is there because
He does not rescue us from the circumstances. He does this for
our benefit in order that we might become more like Jesus. Jesus
learned obedience from the things He suffered (see Heb. 5:8).
What does that say about how you and I will learn obedience?
Embrace the dark times and gain the wisdom that God intends for
you from these times.

Ability Versus Availability

His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor His delight
in the legs of a man; the Lord delights in those who fear Him,
who put their hope in His unfailing love.
- (Psalms 147:10-11)


Do you ever feel so skilled in what you do that you require
little help from others? Perhaps you may feel that you are more
skilled than any other in your field. Does God need your skills
and abilities in order to accomplish His purposes on this earth?
The answer is NO.

One thing God does not need is our skills and abilities. However,
He does give us the privilege to exercise our gifts and abilities
for His service. That service may be as a computer technician, a
secretary, an ironworker, or even a lawyer. God calls each of us
to our vocations to work unto Him. To believe that He needs our
skills to accomplish His mission on earth would be to lower our
understanding of an all-encompassing and all-powerful God. The
psalmist tells us that His pleasure is not in our strength and
ability, but His pleasure is in the attitude of the heart. It is
what we find in the heart that helps determine whether ability is
translated into availability. You see, God is looking to and fro
throughout the earth for a man or woman who is fully committed to
Him. A man or woman who is committed to fearing the Lord and
placing his hope in His unfailing love is the person God seeks to
support. ""For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to
strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him"" (2
Chron. 16:9a). When our agenda becomes His agenda, we can expect
God to fully support all that we do.

If we want to see our skills and abilities multiplied a
hundredfold, then we must make them completely available to His
service. Where are the opportunities in which God is calling you
to be available to Him? Next time someone asks you to be involved
in some activity, before you say yea or nay, make sure you check
in with the Master of our decisions to ensure that your gifts and
talents are being used as He desires.

THE PEACE OF GOD

Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world
gives, do I give to you (John 14:27).

Peace on earth--that's what everybody wants. But nobody can
guarantee external peace because nobody can control other people
or circumstances. Nations sign and break peace treaties with
frightening regularity. Couples lament that there would be peace
in their home ""if only he/she would shape up."" No one can
guarantee peace at home or on the job site. However, we should
always strive to be peacemakers. Jesus said, ""Blessed are the
peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God"" (Matthew 5:9).
Paul instructed, ""If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at
peace with all men"" (Romans 12:18).

But let's face it: Peace with others isn't always possible,
because peace doesn't just depend on us. Peace on earth is what
we want; peace with God is what we have; the peace of God is what
we need.

Peace with God is something you already have (Romans 5:1). It's
not something you strive for; it's something you received when
you were born again. The Prince of Peace reconciled you to God by
shedding His own blood.

The peace of God is something you need to appropriate daily in
your inner world in the midst of the storms which rage in the
external world (John 14:27). There are a lot of things that can
disrupt your external world because you can't control all your
circumstances and relationships. But you can control the inner
world of your thoughts by allowing the peace of Christ to rule in
your heart on a daily basis (Colossians 3:15). There may be chaos
all around you, but God is bigger than any storm. I keep a little
plaque on my desk which reminds me: ""Nothing will happen to me
today that God and I cannot resolve.""

The peace of Christ will rule in your heart when you ""let the
word of Christ richly dwell within you"" (Colossians 3:16). And
when you turn to Him in prayer, ""the peace of God, which
surpasses all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and your
minds in Christ Jesus"" (Philippians 4:7).

Prince of Peace, rule in my heart today. Give me Your peace and
make me a peacemaker in all my relationships.

THE BONDAGE BREAKER

If therefore the Son shall make you free, you shall be free
indeed (John 8:36).

The contrast between bondage and freedom in a believer's life is
beautifully illustrated in the following letter from a successful
professional man.

    Dear Neil:

    My emotional troubles were probably rooted in my childhood
    experiences with horror movies, Ouija boards, etc. I clearly
    remember fearing a visit from devilish forces after I saw the
    movie titled The Blood of Dracula.

    My father had a pretty hot temper and was given to emotional
    outbursts. My survival response was to sulk and blame myself
    for upsetting him. Bottling my emotions inside became a way
    of life. As I grew into adulthood, I continued to blame
    myself for any and all personal shortcomings and misfortunes.

    Then I accepted Christ as my personal Lord and Savior. I grew
    spiritually over the next several years, but I never enjoyed
    complete peace. There was always a lingering doubt about my
    relationship with God whom I saw as distant and stern. I had
    difficulty praying, reading the Bible and paying attention to
    the pastor's sermons. I seriously questioned the purpose of
    life. I experienced horrible nightmares which woke me up
    screaming.

    It was during my time of prayer with you that I finally found
    freedom in Christ. Now when I read God's Word, I understand
    it like never before. I have developed a more positive
    attitude, and my entire relationship with my Lord has
    completely changed. Since our meeting, I haven't had one
    nightmare.

I'm not saying that every spiritual problem is the result of
direct demonic activity. But you may be in bondage because you
have overlooked or denied the reality of demonic powers at work
in the world. Your inheritance in Christ is the basis for your
complete freedom promised in Scripture.

Help me not to be a spiritual ostrich today, but to be alert to
my enemy's tactics and to Your truth.

Possessions of the Kingdom

But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward
they will come out with great possessions.
- (Genesis 15:14)


Whenever God brings you through a time of great adversity, you
can expect to come out of that experience with great possessions,
if you have been faithful through the trial. This is a universal
truth. Wisdom comes from obedience, not knowledge. When we have
been tested and proven, the reality of our faith results in
possessions from God that we would never receive if we had not
gone through those trials. These are precious in His sight and
should be valued greatly. Those who know you will be amazed at
the wisdom that comes from your mouth. It is one of those
mysteries of the gospel that only those who experience incredible
testing and hardship can explain.

God kept the people of Israel enslaved 400 years, but when the
time came to free them from the bondage of slavery, they came out
with great possessions. These physical possessions symbolize the
spiritual possessions we receive when we come out of being
enslaved to those things that have hindered us all our lives.
These possessions are to be shared with others so that they also
can know how they might become free.

What has God freed you from that allows you to share your
possessions with others? Share what God has done in your life
with someone you work with today. It may be the possession they
need most in their life.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Passing the Tests

The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to
one of your neighbors-to David.
- (1 Samuel 28:17)


When God anoints a person, a pattern of testing appears to take
place at specific times in the leader's life. God often takes
each leader through four major tests to determine if that person
will achieve God's ultimate call on his or her life. The person's
response to these tests is the deciding factor in whether they
can advance to the next level of responsibility in God's Kingdom.

Control-Control is one of the first tests. Saul spent most of his
time as king trying to prevent others from getting what he had.
Saul never got to the place with God in which he was a grateful
recipient of God's goodness to him. Saul was a religious
controller. This control led to disobedience and ultimately being
rejected by God because Saul no longer was a vessel God could
use.

Bitterness-Every major character in the Bible was hurt by another
person at one time or another. Jesus was hurt deeply when Judas,
a trusted follower, betrayed Him. Despite knowing this was going
to happen, Jesus responded by washing Judas' feet. Every anointed
leader will have a Judas experience at one time or another. God
watches us to see how we will respond to this test. Will we take
up an offense? Will we retaliate? It is one of the most difficult
tests to pass.

Power-Power is the opposite of servanthood. Jesus had all
authority in Heaven and earth, so satan tempted Jesus at the top
of the mountain to use His power to remove Himself from a
difficult circumstance. How will we use the power and influence
God has entrusted to us? Do we seek to gain more power? There is
a common phrase in the investment community, ""He who has the gold
rules."" Jesus modeled the opposite. He was the ultimate servant
leader.

Greed-This is a difficult one. Money has the ability to have
great influence for either good or bad. When it is a focus in our
life, it becomes a tool of destruction. When it is a by-product,
it can become a great blessing. Many leaders started out
well-only to be derailed once prosperity became a part of their
life. There are thousands who can blossom spiritually in
adversity; only a few can thrive spiritually under prosperity.

As leaders, we must be aware when we are being tested. You can be
confident that each one of these tests will be thrown your way if
God calls you for His purposes. Will you pass these tests? Ask
for God's grace today to walk through these tests victoriously.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

Subject:	Curve Verification - Ercot


The estate has been working with traders in order to validate curves.    We are also talking with brokers and reviewing Megawatt Daily archives.
Can I get some curve information from the Ercot team?   

  I have three specific dates to verify:  11/30, 12/3 and 12/30.
We are validating the marks for the daily, balmo, the prompt month and the cals.on the above mentioned dates.

Do you have this information?

I have talked to Peggy at APB.  She is willing to pass on info on the dailies,  but the historical data is something they want us to pay for.  I dont really need help with the daily stuff,  just the dates listed above.

I would appreciate any help that you can give,

             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

January 30

THE DEFINITION OF DISCIPLESHIP

Encourage one another, and build up one another, just as you also
are doing (1 Thessalonians 5:11).

Jesus' primary call to His disciples is seen in His words ""Come
to Me"" (Matthew 11:28) and ""Follow Me"" (Matthew 4:19). Mark
records: ""He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him, and
that He might send them out to preach, and to have authority to
cast out the demons"" (Mark 3:14, 15). Notice that Jesus'
relationship with His disciples preceded His assignment to them.
Discipleship is the intensely personal activity of two or more
persons helping each other experience a growing relationship with
God. Discipleship is being before doing, maturity before
ministry, character before career.

Every Christian, including you, is both a disciple and a
discipler in the context of his Christian relationships. You have
the awesome privilege and responsibility both to be a teacher and
a learner of what it means to be in Christ, walk in the spirit
and live by faith. You may have a role in your family, church or
Christian community which gives you specific responsibility for
discipling others, such as husband/father, pastor, Sunday school
teacher, discipleship group leader, etc. But even as an appointed
discipler, you are never not a disciple who is learning and
growing in Christ through your relationships. Conversely, you may
not have an ""official"" responsibility to disciple anyone, but you
are never not a discipler. You have the opportunity to help your
children, your friend, and other believers grow in Christ through
your caring and committed relationship with them.

Similarly, every Christian is both a counselor and counselee in
the context of his Christian relationships. A good counselor
should be a good discipler, and a good discipler should be a good
counselor. Biblically, they are the same role. Your level of
maturity may dictate that you do a lot of Christian counseling.
But there will still be times when you need to seek or receive
the counsel of other Christians. There will never be a day when
we don't need each other.

Father, help me remember that I will never be so mature that I
need not receive godly counsel from my brothers and sisters in
Christ.

             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

January 11

SPRING-LOADED TOWARD THE SPIRIT

Walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the
flesh (Galatians 5:16).

When we first became Christians, we were like one-third
horsepower lawn mower engines. We could accomplish something, but
not very much because we weren't very mature. Our ambition as
Christians is to become engines that can power earth-moving
machinery--real powerhouses for the Lord. But neither a lawn
mower nor a bulldozer can accomplish anything without gas. And
neither can we accomplish anything apart from Christ (John 15:5).
No matter how mature you are, you can never be productive unless
you are walking in the Spirit.

When it comes to the choice between walking according to the
flesh and walking according to the Spirit, our will is like a
toggle switch. The new Christian's will seems to be spring-loaded
toward fleshly behavior. He is still the unwitting victim of a
thoroughly trained flesh which only knows how to operate
independently of God. The mature Christian's will is
spring-loaded toward the Spirit. He makes occasional poor
choices, but he is learning to crucify the flesh and walk in the
Spirit on a daily basis.

If you re hoping for a magic formula or a list of foolproof steps
for walking in the Spirit, you will be disappointed. The moment
you reduce the Spirit-filled walk to a formula or an intellectual
exercise, you probably won't be Spirit-filled anymore.

The Holy Spirit is a ""He,"" not an ""it."" Our walk with God is a
personal experience, not a mechanical or legalistic formula. We
see the immorality of fleshly indulgence everywhere, but simply
preaching against it and telling people to shape up is not God's
answer. The law is powerless to give life (Galatians 3:21).
Reintroducing the law to believers won't work. But if we learn to
walk by the Spirit, we won't carry out the desires of the flesh.
Let's encourage others to do the same.

Lord, I desire to be patient with others in their walk of faith
as You are patient with me. Help me have a gracious response and
a gentle answer to others today.

Godly Rewards

You have said, ""It is futile to serve God. What did we gain by
carrying out His requirements and going about like mourners
before the Lord Almighty? But now we call the arrogant blessed.
Certainly the evildoers prosper, and even those who challenge God
escape.""
- (Malachi 3:14-15)


Have you ever felt that serving God had little reward and the
ungodly seemed actually to be more blessed than you? This is what
the people of God felt. God heard their cry and responded through
the prophet Malachi to explain God's view on this matter.

Then those who feared the Lord talked with each other, and the
Lord listened and heard. A scroll of remembrance was written in
His presence concerning those who feared the Lord and honored His
name. ""They will be Mine,"" says the Lord Almighty, ""in the day
when I make up My treasured possession. I will spare them, just
as in compassion a man spares his son who serves him. And you
will again see the distinction between the righteous and the
wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not""
(Malachi 3:16-18).

Notice that after the people complained about this, they began to
talk to each other, and the Lord listened and heard. God had been
taking note of those who were serving Him and honoring Him. There
is a day coming in which God will honor His ""treasured
possessions."" We will see that there is a distinction between the
righteous and the wicked on that day when ""the sun of
righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. And you will
go out and leap like calves released from the stall"" (Mal. 4:2).
What a beautiful picture of what we will feel like on that day.

Faithful obedience is rewarded by God. It often requires
patience, suffering, and perseverance. Be of good cheer; He will
reward you if you faint not.

"CAN YOU HELP ME?---   Jeff King","FROM Dr OLOGURU
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
UNION TOGOLAISE DU BANQUE
LOME- TOGO.
TEL:00228-911-40-37.



DEAR,
                   (CONFIDETIAL PLEASE)

I am Dr OLOGURU, chief accountant for the bills and
credits in the foreign remittance dept. section of
Union Togolaise Du Banque Lome-Togo in west Africa
with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact
you on a business transaction that will be very
beneficial to both of us at the end of the
transaction.

During our investigation and auditting in this bank,
my
department came across a very huge sum of money
belonging to a deceased person who died on november
1992 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in
his account with this Bank without any claim of the
fund in our custody either from his family or relation
before our discovery to this development.

Although personally, I keep this information secret
within myself and partner to enable the whole plans
and idea be Profitable and successful during the time
of execution. The said amount was $6,500,000.00usd(six
million five hundred thousand united states dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive
information through my good friends who works with
chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here
in Lome-Togo. It is him who recommended your person
to me to be viable and capable to champion a business
of such magnitude without any problem .

Meanwhile all the whole arrangements to put claim over
this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,
get the required approval and transfer this money to a
foreign account has been put in place and directives
and needed information will be relayed to you as soon
as you indicate your interest and willingness to
assist us and also benefit your self to this great
business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because
of my position in this country as a civil servant, we
are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would
eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the
time
of transfer because I work in this bank.

This is the actual reason why it will require a second
party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of
kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and
also present a foreign account where he will need the
money to be re-transferred into, on his request as it
may be after due verification and clarification by the
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money
will be remitted from to your own designation bank
account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction
is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this
transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total
sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to
take care of expenses that may arise during the time
of transfer and also telephone and fax bills, while
60% will be for me and my partner.

Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as
we are still in service and intend to retire from
service after we conclude this deal with you. I will
be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank
until you confirm the money in your account. and ask
us
to come down to your country for subsequent sharing
of the fund according to percentage.

previously indicated and further investment, either in
your country or any country you advice us to invest
in. All other necessary information will be sent to
you
when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as
soon as possible, stating your wish in this deal.

Yours faithfully,
Dr.OLOGURU

A New Breed of Businesspeople

Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to
Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of
the people....
- (Haggai 2:2)


Zerubbabel was the governor of Judah 60 years after the great
temple built by Solomon had been destroyed. The temple lay in
ruins, and the Lord spoke to the prophet Haggai, ""Is it a time
for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while
this house remains a ruin?"" (Hag. 1:4) God was calling for a
remnant of His people to come out of their comfort zones and
restore the glory of God's house.

God is doing this same thing today among Christian businesspeople
throughout the world. He is raising up a remnant of
businesspeople who are being handpicked to use their resources,
skills, and experience to affect nations that have not heard the
message of Jesus Christ. The only way they can hear is by
commerce being brought into their nation through Christian
businesspeople, because these are closed regions to normal
missionary efforts.

""But now be strong, O Zerubbabel,"" declares the Lord. ""Be strong,
O Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you
people of the land,"" declares the Lord, ""and work. For I am with
you,"" declares the Lord Almighty. ""This is what I covenanted with
you when you came out of Egypt. And My Spirit remains among you.
Do not fear"" (Haggai 2:4-5).

The remnant of businesspeople God is calling today understand
that they have to come out of Egypt from their past business
life. Egypt signifies the way of the world. It represents sweat
and toil. It is the flesh. This new way is exemplified by a
pioneer spirit. God knows we need to have courage in order to
move in this realm. Also, God assures us that His Spirit is with
anyone who seeks to live in the realm of supernatural faith.

Are you one of these remnants He has handpicked in these days?
Has He called you out of Egypt in order to do extraordinary
things in your life for His Kingdom? Ask God to show you how He
wants to use you in the marketplace this year. Then act and ""be
strong, all you people of the land.""

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Please take a moment to review the locations of your people and place them in the appropriate seats within your group (best printed on 11 x 17 paper)   Note that desks 858-860, 651-652, 658-660, 662-667 and 705-715 will not be available on Day 1, temporary replacement seats are assigned in the lower right hand of the spread sheet, if the lag time will be over two weeks.  

Kindly return this at your earliest convenience on Thursday, confirming your approval of the names and seat assignments.  I am also including the most current version of the 5th floor for your information.

Call me if you have any questions and thank you.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"PC EPHONE","PC EPHONE (OTC BB: PCPH)
Latest price: 78 cents


Check out this awesome device at http://www.pc-ephone.com
Comparing the 16,197,039 common shares of PC EPHONE
outstanding as of October 31, 2001 with the market
capitalization of a company such as PALM, this is a stock
that really could be about to fly.

With news of carrier approval expected soon, there could be
a huge win here. PCPH was over $6 earlier this year and
that was well before all the recent exciting events.


PC-EPHONE HONORED AT COMDEX FALL 2001

nominated by leading industry experts for such
recognition,'' said David Meltzer, CEO and President, of PC-
EPhone, Inc. ``We are proud of our development partner,

offering securities for sale. An offer to buy or sell can
be made only with accompanying disclosure documents and
only in the states and provinces for which they are

security administrator to determine whether a particular
security is licensed for sale in your state. Many companies
have information filed with state securities regulators and
many will supply investors with additional information on
request. All statements and opinions contained in this
advertisement are the sole opinion of the authors and are
subject to change without notice. We are not liable for any
investment decisions by our readers. Readers should
independently investigate and fully understand all risks

adviser or broker prior to completing any such purchase or
sale decision. We are not registered investment advisers,

bodies. The information contained in this advertisement is

guarantee past performance will be indicative of future
results. Any reference to past performance(s) of companies
previously advertised are specially selected to be
referenced based on the favorable performance of these
companies and the companies referenced may not be
representative of all past advertised companies as not all
past advertised companies may have performed as well.
Readers are cautioned that small and micro-cap stocks are
high-risk investments and that they may lose all or a
portion of their investment if they make a purchase in our
advertised stocks. In order to be in full compliance with
the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(b), we have
received 40,000 free trading shares of PC EPhone, Inc. from
a third party as compensation for the distribution of this
and other advertisements. Since we have received
compensation and hold stock in the advertised company there
is an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and
opinions and such statements and opinions cannot be
considered independent. We will benefit from any increase
in share price of the advertised company. We will sell our
shares at any time, without notice, be that before, during
or immediately after the release of this advertisement. The
liquidation of our stock may have a negative impact on the
securities of the company liquidated, including decreased
market value and/or dilution of the company's securities.
Furthermore, our associates and/or employees and/or
principals may have stock positions in advertised companies
purchased in the open market or in private transactions.
These positions may be liquidated, without prior
notification, even after we have made positive comments
regarding the advertised company. It should be understood
that any price targets and/or projections mentioned are
solely opinions and should not be taken as suggested
holding periods. In fact, we will sell our positions in any
companies advertised before they reach such target prices.
The receipt of this information constitutes your acceptance
of these terms and conditions. Reading this advertisement
shall not create under any circumstances an offer to buy or
sell stock in any company advertised. Nor shall it create
any principal-agent relationship between the reader and us.
The stocks of advertised companies may trade in fast
moving, highly volatile markets, and any reader should
observe the trading behavior of any advertised company
prior to investing. Advertised stocks are often thinly
traded and large sell orders will have a substantially
negative impact on share price. Investors in advertised
stocks may experience difficulty in selling shares without
seeing a decline in market price and may have difficulty in
finding ready buyers of their stock. Information within
this advertisement contains ""forward looking"" statements
within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the U.S. Securities
Act of 1933 and Section 21(e) of the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Any statements that express or
involve discussions with respect to predictions,
expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives,
goals, assumptions or future events or performance are not
statements of historical facts and may be forward looking
statements. Forward looking statements are based on
expectations, estimates and projections at the time the
statements are made that involve a number of risks and
uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to
differ materially from those presently anticipated. Forward
looking statements may be identified through the use of
words such as expects, will, anticipates, estimates,
believes, or by statements indicating certain actions may,
could or might occur. We encourage our readers to invest
carefully and read the investor information available at
the web sites of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) at http://www.sec.gov and the National
Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) at
http://www.nasd.com. We also strongly recommend that you
read the SEC advisory to investors concerning Internet
Stock Fraud, which can be found at
http://www.sec.gov/consumer/cyberfr.htm. The NASD has
published information on how to invest carefully at its web
site. Readers can review all public filings by companies at
the SEC s EDGAR page. All information within this
advertisement is qualified in its entirety by the detailed
information and financial statements of the advertised
company contained in its regulatory filings with the SEC.

Knowledge That is Productive

For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they
will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
- (2 Peter 1:8)


Productivity is a term all businesspeople can relate to. It is
the by-product of what we desire from our work. Without
productivity, we do not make sales, we do not deliver goods, we
do not achieve our goals. There are things in our business lives
that can creep in making us unproductive. The same is true in our
walk with God.

The apostle Peter tells us that we can become knowledgeable of
Jesus but fail to be effective and productive in our relationship
with Him. We are a society that has great knowledge, but our
comparable scale of productivity from that knowledge is extremely
weighted to the knowledge side. The apostle Peter tells us there
is a solution to this dilemma.

For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith
goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge,
self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to
perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness;
and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you possess these
qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being
ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ (2 Peter 1:5-8).

Is your Christian experience filled with knowledge, but little
power? Is there a staleness in your walk with God? Is there an
unrest in your soul? It may be due to a need to develop character
that only the Holy Spirit can develop out of an obedient heart.
Ask the Lord today to add these qualities to your faith so that
you can be productive as a soldier of Jesus Christ.

             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

February 5

HOW WE PERCEIVE OURSELVES

The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are
children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and
fellow heirs with Christ (Romans 8:16, 17).

Lydia is a middle-aged woman who was dealt a bad hand in life
right from the beginning. Memories of ritual and sexual abuse
that she suffered as a young child have haunted her continually
throughout her Christian life. When she came to see me, her
damaged self-image seemed beyond repair. As she told me her
story, Lydia displayed little emotion, but her words reflected
total despair.

When she concluded, I asked, ""Who are you, Lydia? How do you
perceive yourself?""

""I'm evil,"" she answered stoically. ""I'm just no good for
anybody. People tell me I'm evil and all I do is bring trouble.""

""You're not evil,"" I argued. ""How can a child of God be evil? Is
that how you perceive yourself?"" Lydia nodded.

It is never pleasant to see the evil one express his ugly
personality through a victim like Lydia. But realizing that she
is primarily the product of the work of Christ on the cross
instead of the victim of her past, she was able to throw off the
chains of spiritual bondage and begin living according to her
true identity as a child of God.

Nothing is more foundational to your freedom from Satan's bondage
than understanding and affirming what God has done for you in
Christ and who you are as a result. We all live in accordance
with our perceived identity. In fact, we cannot consistently
behave in a way that is inconsistent with how we perceive
ourselves. Your attitudes, actions, responses and reactions to
life's circumstances are often determined by your conscious and
subconscious self-perception. If you see yourself as the helpless
victim of Satan and his schemes, you will live like his victim
and be in bondage to his lies. But if you see yourself as the
dearly loved and accepted child of God that you really are, you
will more likely live like a child of God.

Thank You, Jesus, that You have made me more than a conqueror.
Because of Your love and power, I can live as a victor instead of
a victim today.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Sacrificing at What Cost

...""I will not sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that
cost me nnothing.""
- (2 Samuel 24:24)


One day I was having lunch with a man who had a certain amount of
notoriety in his life. After a time of getting to know each
other, he said, ""How can I help you?"" Those words surprised me
coming from a man who obviously already had many requirements on
his time. My first thought was that I was impressed with the
individual. My next thought was to wonder whether it was a
genuine offer or just an effort to impress me with his humility
and Christian piety. I have since discovered he was sincere.

This encounter reminded me that each of us must be willing to
give to others without a motive to get anything in return. It is
simply an act of serving others. Jesus said that we must consider
others more important than ourselves. When is the last time you
did something for another without a motive of getting anything in
return?

When King David came to offer a sacrifice and pray for the
removal of a plague on Israel, he was given the opportunity to
make the sacrifice without the cost of purchasing the sacrificial
animals.

But the king replied to Araunah, ""No, I insist on paying you for
it. I will not sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that
cost me nothing."" So David bought the threshing floor and the
oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them. David built an
altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and
fellowship offerings. Then the Lord answered prayer in behalf of
the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped (2 Samuel
24:24-25).

David, understanding the principle of giving, said he could not
offer anything to God that did not cost him something. Otherwise,
it was not a sacrificial gift.

When is the last time you sacrificed for another that it cost you
something with no expectation of getting anything in return? We
can all give something to others, such as our time, our money, or
our expertise. This is real Christianity that models the Spirit
of Christ. The next time you meet with someone, why not consider
how you might be a blessing to that person. Why not ask, ""How can
I help you?""

"MILITARY RESALE GROUP","BACTROL TECHNOLOGIES (OTC BB: BCTL)  MILITARY RESALE GROUP
Latest price: $1.27


MRG, as a private company with limited capital, grew 5
fold, breaking $5 Million in revenue. MRG as BCTL, a public
company, has greater access to capital and to registered
securities to assist in future acquisitions and expansion.

MRG today announced they have increased their space 3
times. Watch for revenue to soar 3 - 5 times again.

Military Market Segment Is Hot. Xcel Associates'  target is
$3.00.


MRG TRIPLES WAREHOUSE SPACE IN ANTICIPATION OF CONTINUED
RAPID GROWTH

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.--Oct. 16, 2001--Military Resale
Group, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL) is pleased to announce it has
moved from its previous 12,000-square-foot warehouse to one
containing almost 33,000 square feet.

This move will allow the Company to approximately triple
its dry space, double its cooler space and triple its
freezer space. Ethan D. Hokit, President, stated that
``many household name companies have requested that we
begin to service their accounts in our current market.
Consequently, we continue our planned multiphase expansion
to serve the Military Resale Market. Military Resale Group,
Inc. is negotiating with several companies to obtain new
business and anticipates showing continued growth in sales,
which the new warehouse would accommodate.''

In 1999, Military Resale Group, Inc. was housed in a 2,500-
square-foot warehouse and a few months later acquired
another 2,000 square feet. In October 1999, the Company
acquired another 7,500 square feet, bringing its total to
12,000 square feet. This space was adequate until a few
months ago, when it became evident that more warehouse
space was needed to support the growth that the Company is
experiencing.

Military Resale Group, Inc. (MRG) was incorporated in 1997
when it acquired a 50-year-old distributor to the Military
Resale Market. At that time MRG's annual sales were
$750,000, and they have since soared five-fold in three
years to $4.5 million in 2000. Military Resale Group is now
a publicly owned company as a result of its recent
acquisition by Bactrol Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL).

The Military Resale Market is a $15 billion niche market,
with 13,000,000 authorized patrons, which operates under
the aegis of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), a
Department of Defense agency. The DOD's objective, in this
area, is to operate resale store systems, which sell
groceries (at commissaries) and general merchandise (at
exchanges, i.e., PXs) at the lowest possible prices. The
resulting average cost savings of about 25% are a major
fringe benefit (untaxed) to military personnel. The
competitive structure of the Military Resale Market
consists of a few large distributors, who do not dominate
the industry, and hundreds of small ones. The post-
acquisition strategy of MRG is to grow, primarily, by
acquiring other small distributors and, secondarily, by
internal growth.

                  Marketplace Meditations
                       by Os Hillman

Our Labor in the Lord

Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you.
Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you
know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
- (1 Corinthians 15:58)


There is a paradigm shift going on among a remnant of
businesspeople today. That paradigm shift is a focus on using our
business and work life as a platform for ministry versus a
platform solely for material success. There is a remnant of
businesspeople throughout the world today who understand their
birthright in the marketplace is to reflect Christ fully in and
through their work. It is reflected by a commitment to use their
resources and skills to provide a product of excellence with the
overall motive to affect people for Jesus Christ. The difference
is that these individuals have an overriding ministry objective
to their work.

When the apostle Paul tells us to fully work unto the Lord, he
does not mean we must be working as missionaries in ""full-time
Christian effort."" He understands that all of life is holy and
sacred to God. If our motive is to serve God where we are, then
our labor ""in the Lord is not in vain.""

As you begin your work today, ask God if you are working with the
primary motive of reflecting His life and character through your
work on this day. Let nothing move you from this motive being
central to your activity. The Lord will reflect His power and
leading in and through your life when this becomes your primary
motive.

CHILDREN NEED MODELS

A pupil is not above his teacher; but everyone, after he has been
fully trained, will be like his teacher (Luke 6:40).

Your children need to see how you handle failure even more than
how you handle success. If you make a mistake, you need to own up
to it and ask forgiveness if the situation calls for it. If you
don't model how to deal with your own fleshly responses, how are
they going to learn how to own up to their mistakes and resolve
them biblically?

One Sunday morning my daughter wasn't ready when I wanted to
leave for church. I fumed about it until I exploded with anger.
After the service I was about to say grace before a meal when I
felt the convicting hand of God weighing heavily upon me. I
stopped and asked my family to forgive me for my outburst of
anger. I didn't confess my daughter's tardiness because it wasn't
my responsibility. Nor did I ask their forgiveness in hopes that
my daughter would own up to her tardiness. I asked their
forgiveness because my outburst of anger was a deed of the flesh.
I had to ask forgiveness to be right with God myself.

You never lose esteem in your child's eyes when you do what God
requires you to do. You gain esteem because you are an honest
person, and in the process you are modeling what they need to do
when they blow it. Children need models, not critics. Modeling is
what establishes our credibility to ""bring them up in the
discipline and instruction of the Lord"" (Ephesians 6:4).

Lord, help me model a life of obedience and honesty before my
children and others who look to me as an example. And when I
fail, give me grace to admit my mistakes and resolve my
conflicts.

THE FULL ARMOR OF GOD

Therefore, take up the full armor of God, that you may be able to
resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm
(Ephesians 6:13).

A primary element in our protection from Satan and evil is the
armor that God has provided for us and instructed us to put on in
Ephesians 6:13-17. When we put on the armor of God, we are really
putting on Christ (Romans 13:12-14). And when we put on Christ,
we take ourselves out of the realm of the flesh, where we are
vulnerable to attack, and we place ourselves within the dominion
of Christ, where the evil one cannot touch us. Satan has nothing
in Christ (John 14:30), and to the extent that we put on Christ,
the evil one cannot touch us (1 John 5:18). He can only touch
that which is on his own level. That's why we are commanded,
""Make no provision for the flesh"" (Romans 13:14), meaning ""Don't
live on Satan's level.""

It would appear from the verb tenses in Ephesians 6;14, 15, that
three of the pieces of armor--belt, breastplate and shoes--are
already on you: ""having girded . . .""; ""having put on . . ."";
having shod. . . ."" These pieces of armor represent the elements
of your protection made possible when you receive Jesus Christ
and in which you are commanded to stand firm. The Greek tense of
""having"" signifies that the action it refers to was completed
before we were commanded to stand firm. That's the logical way a
soldier would prepare for action: He would put on his belt,
breastplate and shoes before attempting to stand firm. Likewise,
we are to put on the full armor of God after having already put
on Christ.

When you read through Ephesians 6:10-20, you will notice the
emphasis on the active part we must play on behalf of our own
spiritual defense: ""be strong"" (verse 10); ""put on"" and ""stand
firm"" (verse 11); ""take up,"" ""be able,"" ""resist,"" and ""stand
firm"" (verse 13); ""stand firm"" (verse 14); ""taking up"" (verse
16); ""take"" (verse 17)' ""pray at all times"" and ""be on the alert""
(verse 18).

Over the next several days, we will consider each of the six
pieces of armor from Ephesians 6:13-17.

Teach me my responsibility in spiritual warfare, Lord, that I may
be strong in You and in the strength of Your might.

An Encounter With God

So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no
strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless.
- (Daniel 10:8)


Daniel received a vision that troubled him greatly. He wanted
understanding of this vision. He set himself out to understand
the vision by fasting for three weeks. Three days after his three
weeks of fasting, a messenger of God appeared to Daniel. The
messenger explained that Heaven had heard his prayer from the
first day, but the angel was temporarily prevented from coming by
the prince of Persia, a demon angel, who sought to thwart God's
messenger from coming to Daniel.

There are times in our lives when we must set ourselves to
seeking God with all our hearts. It is in these times that we
hear from Heaven in ways we may never have experienced before.
Daniel's perseverance in prayer was rewarded with a personal
encounter with Heaven. However, in order to receive from God,
Daniel had to be left alone, his strength removed, and be placed
in a helpless condition. When we have no ability in our own
strength to move Heaven or the events around us, we are in
position to hear from Heaven. It is the acknowledgment of our
humanity and our frailness that places us in a position to have a
personal encounter with the living God.

Do you need a personal encounter with God today? Do you need God
to intervene on your behalf? Seek Him with all your heart.
Demonstrate to Him you are serious. Get alone and acknowledge
your helpless condition before Him. He will reward you with His
presence.

THE BELT OF TRUTH

Having girded your loins with truth (Ephesians 6:14).

The first piece of armor for the Christian warrior is the belt of
truth. Jesus said, ""I am . . . the truth"" (John 14:6). And
because Christ is in you, the truth is in you. However,
continuing to choose truth is not always easy. Since Satan's
primary weapon is the lie, your belt of truth (which holds the
other pieces of body armor in place) is continually being
attacked. If he can disable you in the area of truth, you become
as easy target for his other attacks.

You stand firm in the truth by relating everything you do to the
truth of God's Word. If a thought comes to mind which is not in
harmony with God's truth, dismiss it. If an opportunity comes
along to say or do something which compromises or conflicts with
truth, avoid it. Adopt a simple rule of behavior: If it's the
truth, I'm in; if it's not the truth, count me out.

When you learn to live in the truth on a daily basis, you will
grow to love the truth because you have nothing to hide. You
never have to cover up to God or anyone else; everything you do
is in the light. Furthermore, when you live in the truth you
dislodge the lies of Satan, the father of lies (John 8:44).
Remember that if Satan can deceive you into believing a lie, he
can control your life.

Jesus prayed, ""I do not ask Thee to take them out of the world,
but to keep them from the evil one"" (John 17:15). How? ""Sanctify
them in the truth; Thy Word is truth"" (verse 17). You will only
dislodge Satan's lies in the light of God's revelation, and not
by human reasoning or research.

The only thing a Christian ever has to admit to is the truth.
Walking in the light and speaking the truth in love may seem
threatening to some. But in reality truth is a liberating friend
and the only path to fellowship with God.

Forgive me, Lord, for entertaining lies and walking in darkness.
Give me courage to face the truth and to speak the truth in love.

SPIRITUALLY ALIVE

And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and
this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does
not have the Son of God does not have life (1 John 5:11, 12 NIV).

When God breathed life into Adam, he was both physically and
spiritually alive. Adam was spiritually alive because his soul
was in union with God. We were never designed to be separated
from God or to live independently of Him. We were born to be
spiritually alive.

For the Christian, to be spiritually alive is to be in union with
God. This concept is repeatedly presented in Scripture by the
prepositional phrase in Christ. Being in Christ is the theme of
the New Testament. Like Adam, we were created to be in union with
God. But Adam sinned and his union with God, and ours as well,
was severed. It is God's eternal plan to bring human creation
back to Himself and restore the union He enjoyed with Adam at
creation. That restored union with God, which we find in Christ,
is the essence of our identity.

When you were born again, your soul was united with God and you
came alive spiritually, as alive as Adam was in the garden before
he sinned. As the New Testament repeatedly declares, you are now
in Christ, and Christ is in you. Since Christ who is in you is
eternal, the spiritual life you have received from Him is
eternal. You don't have to wait until you die to get eternal
life; you possess it right now!

The apostle John wrote, ""He who has the Son has the life"" (1 John
5:12). He probably remembered Jesus' statement to Martha: ""I am
the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me shall live
even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes in Me shall
never die"" (John 11:25, 26). After Jesus said this to Martha, He
added, ""Do you believe this?"" (verse 26).

The Word of God is clear: Because of Jesus, we will continue to
live spiritually even after we die physically. Do you believe
this?

Dear Father, I declare my wholehearted belief that my spiritual
life--eternal life--is in You. Help me live today with eternity's
values in view.

GOD'S MINISTRY OF DARKNESS

For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for
Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our
mortal flesh (2 Corinthians 4:11).

What is the point of troubled times in our lives? What is God
trying to do? What is He trying to teach us? Peter wrote,
""Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you,
which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange
thing were happening to you; but to the degree that you share the
sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing; so that also at the
revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with exultation"" (1
Peter 4:12, 13).

In God's ministry of testing, we learn a lot about ourselves.
Whatever is left of simplistic advice such as ""Read your Bible""
or ""Just work harder"" or ""Pray more"" gets stripped away. Most
people going through testing times would love to resolve the
crisis, but they seemingly can't and don't know why.

In God's ministry of darkness we learn compassion. We learn to
wait patiently with people. We learn to respond to the emotional
needs of people who have lost hope. We weep with those who weep.
We don't try to teach or instruct or advise. If God took away
every external blessing and reduced our assets to nothing more
than meaningful relationships, would that be enough to sustain
us? Yes, I believe it would.

Perhaps God brings us to the end of our resources so we can
discover the vastness of His. We don't hear many sermons about
brokenness in our churches these days, yet in all four Gospels
Jesus taught us to deny ourselves, pick up our cross daily, and
follow Him. I don't know any painless way to die to ourselves,
but I do know that it's necessary and that it's the best possible
thing that could ever happen to us.

""No pain, no gain,"" says the body builder. Isn't that true in the
spiritual realm as well (Hebrews 12:11)? Proven character comes
from persevering through the tribulations of life (Romans 5:3-5).
Every great period of personal growth in my life and ministry has
been preceded by a major time of testing.

Lord, I submit to Your testing so I may come to the end of my
resources and joyfully discover Yours.

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's ""RTO Week"" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was ""RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets.""  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

UNDER SPIRITUAL ATTACK

The Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall
away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons (1 Timothy 4:1).

A seminary student stopped by my office to tell me he was having
difficulty getting to school on time. What should have been a
five-minute drive lengthened to 45 minutes because a voice in his
mind kept telling him to turn at intersections. Not wanting to
disobey what he perceived to be the ""still, small voice of God,""
he was treated to a tour of the city almost every morning.

A pastor's wife, desperately needing the comfort of the Holy
Spirit and desiring His leading, passively believed that whatever
entered her mind was from God. She soon found herself bound by
fear and plagued by condemning thoughts.

These examples underscore the wisdom of John Wesley's words: ""Do
not hastily ascribe things to God. Do not easily suppose dreams,
voices, impressions, visions or revelations to be from God. They
may be from Him. They may be from nature. They may be from the
devil. Therefore, do not believe every spirit, but try the
spirits, whether they be from God"" (Martin Wells Knapp,
Impressions, Wheaton, IL: Tyndale House Publishers, 1984, p. 32).

In a survey of 1700 professing Christian teenagers, 70 percent
admitted to hearing voices, like there was a subconscious self
talking to them. I don't believe they are psychotic or paranoid
schizophrenic. There is a battle going on for their minds. I have
shared with many tormented people that they aren't going crazy
but are under spiritual attack. They usually respond, ""Praise the
Lord, someone understands."" It's freeing to know this truth,
because if there is a battle going on for our minds, we can win
that war.

Lord, today I choose to test the spirits and assume my
responsibility to think upon that which is true.

"FW: Summary RTO Week Day 2 -- Planning & Expansion","

 


  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

                  Marketplace Meditations
                       by Os Hillman

Seeing a Greater Purpose in Adversity

But Paul shouted,""Don't harm yourself! We are all here!""
- (Acts 16:28)


Paul and Silas had just been thrown into prison. An earthquake
erupted and the jail cell was opened. It's Paul and Silas'
opportunity. ""Deliverance! Praise God!"" might be the appropriate
response. But this is not what Paul and Silas did. In fact,
rather than leave, they sat quietly in their cell area. The
guard, in fear of his life, knew that it would be automatic death
if prisoners escaped. Paul and Silas did not leave because they
saw a higher purpose for which they were in prison. They were not
looking at their circumstance; they were much more concerned
about the unsaved guard. The story goes on to explain how Paul
and Silas went home with the guard and his family. Not only did
the guard get saved, but his entire household as well.

What a lesson this is for us. How often we are so busy looking
for deliverance from our circumstance that we miss God
completely. God is looking to do miracles in our circumstances if
we will only look for them. Sometimes as businesspeople we become
so obsessed with our goals we miss the process that God involves
us in, which may be where the miracle lies. What if that bill
collector who has been hounding you is unsaved and he is there
for you to speak to? What if a problem account has arisen due to
something God is doing beyond what you might see at this time?
Our adverse situations can often be the door of spiritual
opportunity for those who need it.

I saw this personally when God allowed me to go through a number
of adversities. It took some time, but I saw some great miracles
as a result of those adversities. When God said that ""all things
work together for good for those who are called according to His
purposes"" (see Rom. 8:28), He meant all things. It is up to us to
find the ""work together for good"" part by being faithful to the
process. In the next adversity you face, tune your spiritual
antennae and ask God for discernment to see the real purpose for
the adversity.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"Online Launch Plan Update","With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power

             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

January 13

BELIEVE IN GOD

Without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to
God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those
who seek Him (Hebrews 11:6).

The life of Wilma Rudolph, the great Olympic sprinter, is a
remarkable story of faith. Wilma was born with health problems
that left her crippled. ""Will I ever be able to run and play like
the other children?"" Wilma asked her parents.

""Honey, you have to believe in God and never give up hope,"" they
responded. ""If you believe, God will make it happen."" Taking her
parents' counsel, she painfully struggled to walk. By the time
she was 12, to the delight and surprise of many, Wilma no longer
needed her braces. She went on to play basketball on her
championship high school team and win three gold medals in the
1960 Olympics.

When you hear inspiring stories of faith like Wilma Rudolph's, do
you sometimes wonder, ""What could I accomplish if I took God at
His Word?"" Faith is the foundational principle of the Christian
life. Believing who God is, what He says, what He has done, and
what He will do defines the kingdom of God.

Furthermore, faith is the essence of the Christian's day-to-day
activity. Paul wrote: ""As you therefore have received Christ
Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him"" (Colossians 2:6). How did you
receive Christ? By faith. How then are you to walk in Him? By
faith. In Scripture, walking refers to the way you conduct your
everyday life. Victorious Christian living and spiritual maturity
are determined by our belief in God.

We tend to think of faith as some kind of mystical quality which
belongs only in the realm of the spiritual. But everybody walks
by faith. It is the most basic operating principle of life. The
question is, in what or in whom do you believe? We are challenged
to believe in God and take His Word seriously.

Thank You, Lord, that Your Word stands forever in heaven. I can
trust in You and Your Word despite my changing feelings and
circumstances.

"IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN THE ENRON CORP SAVINGS & ESOP PLANS","
PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

THE PROCESS OF FORGIVENESS

Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who
curse you, pray for those who mistreat you (Luke 6:27, 28).

Here are 12 simple steps you can use to walk through the process
of forgiving someone who hurt you in the past.

  1 Ask the Lord to reveal the names of the persons who offended
    you and the specific wrongs you suffered.

  2 Face the hurt and the hate. If you are going to forgive from
    your heart, you must let God search the depths of your heart.

  3 Acknowledge the significance of the cross. It is the cross of
    Christ that makes forgiveness legally and morally right.

  4 Decide that you will not retaliate by using the information
    about the offender's sin against them (Luke 6:27-34).
  5 Decide to forgive. Forgiveness is a conscious choice to let
    the other person off the hook and free yourself from the
    past.

  6 Take your list of names to God and pray the following: ""I
    forgive ___(name)___ for ___(specifically identify every
    remembered pain)__.""

  7 Destroy the list. You are now free. Do not tell the offenders
    what you have done. Your forgiveness is between you and God
    unless the offenders have asked you for forgiveness.

  8 Do not expect that your decision to forgive will result in
    major changes in the other persons. Instead, pray for them
    (Matthew 5:44).

  9 Try to understand the people you have forgiven. They are
    victims also.

  10Freedom is a result of forgiveness in you. In time you will
    be able to think about the people who offended you without
    feeling hurt or anger.

  11Thank God for the lessons you have learned and the maturity
    you have gained.

  12When appropriate, accept your part of the blame for the
    offenses you suffered. Confess your failure to God and to
    others (1 John 1:9) and realize that if someone has something
    against you, you must go to that person (Matthew 5:23-26).

Lord, teach me how to love unconditionally and forgive quickly
those who hate me, curse me or mistreat me.

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists were:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mission; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBridge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give testimony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week.  What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energy market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.    

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Schmuel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Carol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should try a couple of different systems and see what works.  

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not physical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissioner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could work together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it's okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premise, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or flowgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not agreed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstances change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable.  

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates) should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on which instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs being allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front.  

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

THE PRIMARY LABORATORY

Wives, be subject to your husbands . . . Husbands, love your
wives . . . Fathers, do not exasperate your children (Colossians
3:18-21).

God works in our lives primarily through committed relationships.
Your family is the primary laboratory for your character
development. This is precisely the order of Scripture: Establish
your identity in Christ, then focus on living out who you are at
home. Notice the order in Colossians 3:10-25;

  * God's great goal for His children is that we conform to His
    image: ""Put on the new self"" (verse 10). Our identity is no
    longer in racial, religious, cultural or social ties: ""There
    is no distinction . . . but Christ is all and in all"" (verse
    11).

  * Character is the focus of development once identity is
    established: ""Put on a heart of compassion, kindness,
    humility, gentleness and patience"" (verse 12).

  * Character is developed in the context of relational living:
    ""Bearing with one another, and forgiving each other"" (verse
    13).

  * Love is the highest level of character development: ""Beyond
    all these things put on love"" (verse 14).

  * The means by which all this is accomplished is Christ in you:
    ""Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts . . . Let the
    word of Christ richly dwell within you"" (verses 15, 16).

  * The primary setting for character development is the home:
    ""Wives, be subject to your husbands . . . Husbands, love your
    wives . . . Children, be obedient to your parents . . .
    Fathers, do not exasperate your children"" (verses 18-21).

As a parent, you are not just shaping your child's behavior, you
are developing his character. Training a child means discipling
him to be Christlike. Don't be a phony at home; your spouse and
children will see right through it. You can't model perfection,
but you can model growth.

Lord, help me be the spouse and parent You want me to be by
remaining committed to be a growing child of God.

A NEW CREATURE

Therefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old
things passed away; behold, new things have come (2 Corinthians
5:17).

Dan and Cindy were a fine young Christian couple who were
preparing for ministry on the mission field. Then tragedy struck:
Cindy was raped. As hard as she tried to get back to normal life,
Cindy couldn't shake the horrible memories and feelings from her
experience.

Six months after the tragedy, Dan and Cindy attended a church
conference where I was speaking. During the conference Cindy
called me in tears. ""Neil, I know God can turn everything into
good, but how is He going to do that?""

""Wait a minute, Cindy,"" I said. ""God will work everything out for
good, but He doesn't make a bad thing good. What happened to you
was evil. God's good thing is to show you how you can walk
through your crisis and come out of it a better person.""

""But I just can't separate myself from my experience,"" she
sobbed. ""I've been raped, Neil, and I'll be a victim of that all
my life.""

""No, Cindy,"" I insisted. ""The rape happened to you, but it hasn't
changed who you are, nor does it have to control you. You were
the victim of a terrible, ugly tragedy. But if you only see
yourself as a rape victim for the rest of your life, you will
never be free. You're a child of God. You can't fix the past, but
you can be free from it.""

All of us have a number of hurtful, traumatic experiences in our
past which have scarred us emotionally. You may have grown up
with a physically, emotionally or sexually abusive parent. Any
number of traumatic, emotional events can clutter your soul with
emotional baggage which seems to limit your maturity and block
your freedom in Christ. You must renounce the experiences and
lies that have controlled you and forgive those who have offended
you.

As a Christian, you are primarily the product of the work of
Christ on the cross. You are literally a new creature in Christ.
The ""old you"" is gone; the ""new you"" is here.

Father, thank You for working all things for good in my life,
even the effects of evil attacks meant for my harm and
destruction.

Subject:	Curve Verification - Ercot


The estate has been working with traders in order to validate curves.    We are also talking with brokers and reviewing Megawatt Daily archives.
Can I get some curve information from the Ercot team?   

  I have three specific dates to verify:  11/30, 12/3 and 12/30.
We are validating the marks for the daily, balmo, the prompt month and the cals.on the above mentioned dates.

Do you have this information?

I have talked to Peggy at APB.  She is willing to pass on info on the dailies,  but the historical data is something they want us to pay for.  I dont really need help with the daily stuff,  just the dates listed above.

I would appreciate any help that you can give,

JForney
Enron Estate Boy

Unprofitable Anger

Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in
the lap of fools.
- (Ecclesiastes 7:9)


Every day of our lives we are placed in situations that engage us
with other people, whether it is in the office, our homes, or in
public places. Do you recall the last time someone cut you off in
traffic, or you were forced to wait in line because someone up
front got held up? Perhaps your employer did something that was
downright unfair. Anger can result from many circumstances.

A friend once told me that anger is like warning lights on the
front of your car dashboard. They signal that there is something
going on under the hood, and we should take a look to examine the
source of the problem. Anger can be traced to a few sources.
First, when we lose control of a circumstance that we have placed
certain expectations on and those expectations do not result in
our desired outcome, we are tempted to get angry. The source of
this type of anger is both fear and protection of personal
rights. You see, when we believe we have a right to something, we
have not given the Lord permission to allow an outcome different
from what we want. If an outcome is different from our
expectations, this may stimulate fear.

For instance, if a vendor failed to deliver an important job on
time due to something out of his control, you may respond out of
anger. Please know that the source of your anger is the fear of
what might happen to you or what this might say about your
abilities to manage a project. You no longer are in control of
the circumstance and this creates fear in you.

The next time you get angry ask the Lord what is the source of
that anger? Did the Lord allow that failure to let you see what
is ""under your hood""? God has not given us a spirit of fear, but
of love, power, and a sound mind (see 2 Tim. 1:7). Give up your
rights to expectations that God never gave you. You will find a
new freedom in Christ you never knew you could have.

The Value of Words

And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair
white or black. Simply let your ""Yes"" be ""Yes,"" and your ""No,""
""No""; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.
- (Matthew 5:36-37)


Imagine for a moment that you are living in Jesus' time. It is
before Jesus has begun His public ministry. He is a carpenter in
your local town of Nazareth. You have asked Jesus to make a table
for you. You're on a deadline and you must have it in a week. You
agree on the price of for the table and the date of one week for
completion. A week later you arrive to pick up the table. You lay
your money down on the table and Jesus says, ""Mr. Johnson, I am
sorry but the table is not ready. I ran into complications. Also,
I can no longer honor the price I gave you. It is now instead of
.""

Two years later you hear about this same Jesus who is preaching
to the local townspeople. How are you going to view this Jesus?
You probably won't give much credence to His message because of
your personal experience. Our lives have an ability to reinforce
the message we stand for, or they can violate it and make it
totally ineffective. This literally happens all over the world in
different settings with Christian businesspeople. Our message
becomes ineffective because we have not done what we said.

I know people who, when they tell me they plan to do something, I
can expect them to follow through about 50 percent of the time. I
am sure you have had the same experience. Words and commitments
are made with little meaning behind those words. However, I know
others who will follow through almost every time. The only time
they don't is when something falls outside their control. I
quickly learn whose words have substance behind them.

There are times when we are unable to perform or deliver what we
promised due to outside influences. The key to turning these
potentially negative circumstances into a witness for Christ is
communication. If we are unable to pay a bill on time, we must
communicate with those we owe and make a good faith effort to
resolve it within our means. In these cases, God's purposes are
being performed as well if we seek to do the right thing.

Do your words mean anything to those who hear them? Do you make
commitments and fail to follow through on them? What would others
say about how you follow through? Ask the Lord today to show you
how you are doing in this area. You might even want to ask three
people who are the closest to you how you fare in this area.

             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

November 20

SIGNS AND WONDERS

By this all men will know that you are My disciples if you have
love for one another (John 13:35).

Signs and wonders validated the ministry of Jesus and the
apostles. After quoting from the prophet Joel and demonstrating
that the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost was biblical,
Peter preached about Jesus of Nazareth as ""a man attested to you
by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed
through Him in your midst"" (Acts 2:22). Of the apostles, Paul
said, ""the signs of a true apostle were performed among you with
all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles"" (2
Corinthians 12:12).

However, signs and wonders would also accompany false teachers
and false prophets (Matthew 7:21-23; 2 Peter 2:1-22). In fact,
biblical references to signs and wonders in the last days are
nearly all credited to false teachers, false prophets and false
Christs (Matthew 24:11, 24). The false prophet in the tribulation
""deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which
it was given him to perform"" (Revelation 13:14).

Jesus is no longer with us in the flesh and there are no more
apostles. Jesus identified the sign of a disciple as markedly
different: ""By this all men will know that you are My disciples,
if you have love for one another"" (John 13:35).

Does this mean that signs and wonders have ceased? I certainly
don't want to be identified with an evil generation that seeks
only after a sign, but I also don't want to be associated with
the powerless, anti-supernaturalism evidenced in Western
rationalism. Both the power of God and the wisdom of God are
expressed in Christ. Paul said, ""For indeed Jews ask for signs,
and Greeks search for wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, to
Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those
who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God
and the wisdom of God"" (1 Corinthians 1:22-24).

Lord, reveal to me the true source of my spiritual experiences.
If they are not from You, I renounce them and command Satan to
leave my presence.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Online Trading Simulation","We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

"Employee Meeting Postponed","We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

Subject: I-45 speed limit


I received this today.  Knew it was going to happen.

Houston/Harris County has wasted little time complying with the new speed
limits imposed by the TNRCC. I learned last evening, from my husband, that
the stretch of I-45 between Hobby Airport and NASA Rd. 1 now has a speed
limit of 55 mph. Noontime yesterday, there were six police cars with people
pulled over along that stretch.

Let's be careful out there!

HOW FAITH AFFECTS OUR LIVES

For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that
no one should boast (Ephesians 2:8, 9).

After Jesus claimed to be sent by God, some were seeking to seize
Him, having come to the conclusion that He was not a good man.
But others did believe in Him, ""and they were saying, 'When the
Christ shall come, He will not perform more signs than those
which this man has, will He?'"" (John 7:31). All the evidence was
there. Some chose to believe; others chose not to. People do the
same today. Faith is a choice. We choose to believe or not
believe.

Faith is the operating principle of life. It is the means by
which we relate to God and live our lives in freedom. Notice the
variety of ways stated in Scripture by which faith affects our
lives.

First, we are saved by faith (Ephesians 2:8, 9).

Second, we ""walk by faith, not by sight"" (2 Corinthians 5:7).

Third, being found faithful is a prerequisite for ministry: ""I
thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He
considered me faithful, putting me into service"" (1 Timothy
1:12). Paul then adds, ""And the things which you have heard from
me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful
men, who will be able to teach others also"" (2 Timothy 2:2). This
is more than being reliable, since a person could be counted on
to follow through on an assignment and not be a believer. The
added ingredient in faithful people is that they know the truth
and can be counted on to be reliable.

Fourth, the quality of any relationship is determined by faith or
trust: ""Many a man proclaims his own loyalty, but who can find a
trustworthy man?"" (Proverbs 20:6). The words faith, trust and
believe are all the same word (pistis) in the original language.
The man who has faith believes in something. The one who believes
also trusts, or he doesn't truly believe. There is no concept
that looms larger in life than faith because what we believe
determines how we live.

Lord, I affirm that I cannot please You without faith. I choose
today to believe in You and trust in Your name.

THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

Having put on the breastplate of righteousness . . . (Ephesians
6:14).

The second piece of armor God has provided for us is the
breastplate of righteousness. When you put on Christ at
salvation, you are justified before our holy God. It's not your
righteousness but Christ's (1 Corinthians 1:30; Philippians 3:8,
9). So when Satan aims an arrow at you by saying, ""You're not
good enough to be a Christian,"" you can respond with Paul, ""Who
will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one who
justifies"" (Romans 8:33). Your righteousness in Christ is your
protection against Satan's accusations.

Even though we rejoice in our position of righteousness in
Christ, we are well aware of our deeds of unrighteousness when we
think, say, or do something apart from God. Standing firm in our
righteousness requires us to live in continuous agreement with
God according to 1 John 1:9: ""If we confess our sins, He is
faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
from all unrighteousness."" Confession is different from saying
""I'm sorry"" or asking forgiveness. To confess (homologeo) means
to acknowledge or to agree. You confess your sin when you say
what God says about it: ""I entertained a lustful thought and
that's a sin""; ""I treated my spouse unkindly this morning and
that was wrong""; ""Pride motivated me to seek that board position
and pride doesn't belong in my life.""

Satan will make confession as difficult for you as he can. He
will try to convince you that it's too late for confession, that
God has already erased your name out of the book of life. That's
another one of his lies. You're in Christ; you're already
forgiven. You are the righteousness of God in Christ (2
Corinthians 5:21), and He will never leave you. Your confession
of sin clears the way for the fruitful expression of
righteousness in your daily life. We should be like Paul, who
said, ""I also do my best to maintain always a blameless
conscience both before God and before men"" (Acts 24:16).

Lord, I put on the breastplate of righteousness today and seek to
maintain a blameless conscience before You and the people around
me.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

SYNERGETIC TECHNOLOGIES (Pink Sheets: SYGE)
Latest price: 4.5 cents


SYGE could trade up dramatically on this news announcement,
released after market close. It' s a powerful story, which
should certainly excite people and this so far overlooked
company could soon take on a high profile. At just 4.5
cents the potential for large short-term gains is huge.
Long- term profits here could be exponential.


SYNERGETIC TECHNOLOGIES COMPLETES THE ACQUISITION OF CUSTOM
BROADBAND INC. TO PROVIDE IN-HOUSE SUPPORT FOR ANTI-
TERRORIST EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE FOR THE AIRLINE AND TRAVEL
INDUSTRIES

SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 28 -- Synergetic Technologies Inc.
(Pink Sheets: SYGE) announced today that the company has
completed the purchase of Custom Broadband Inc., a newly
formed company. Custom Broadband Inc. was formed as an
independent operating arm of a much larger satellite uplink
and broadband broadcasting company. The purpose of the
formation is to provide ICU Security Systems Inc. with
continuous broadcast abilities for all land and air based
transmissions of critical data and live streaming video to
ground based receptors .

Custom Broadband Inc. will work only for ICU Security
Systems Inc. to provide clear and efficient data
transmissions. The principles of Custom Broadband Inc. have
several years of satellite transmission experience, and
will be able to provide this service to the company.

The world airline industry has approximately 12,000
(information obtained from Boeing) active passenger and
commercial aircraft in service at this time. The cost per
aircraft is not static as each airline configures floor
plans differently, and each model of aircraft will have
different requirements based on divisions of floor plan,
and layout of security sensitive areas. The company
anticipates that on board costs for a Boeing 767 for
example would be close to $5,000, and $10,000 per 747, with
a cost of $20,000 per ground unit. Each ground unit will
service 20 aircraft on an immediate tracking base for the
local area of departing and incoming flights, and with the
addition of Custom Broadband Inc. the ground unit can track
a aircraft world wide if desired. The recurring revenue
stream from data transition will be paid to Synergetic
Technologies Inc. on a per minute bases with a 20% built in
profit over and above transmission costs. These charges
will be collected weekly using electronic bank
transactions.

The addition of Custom Broadband Inc. also allows the
company to broadcast images worldwide from any moving or
stationary platform. This is considered a very important
part of the development path for 2 additional products that
will be made available for the home and retail market using
very similar technologies based on a home computer, to
provide worldwide access to home and personal property
surveillance using portions of the ICU Security System Inc.
platform.

Although it is hard to put a dollar figure on the future
business of this company the future is very bright and the
company looks forward to active beta tests in the very near
future. Investors should be advised that these are
developmental stage companies and technologies. However it
is the goal of Synergetic Technologies Inc. to provide a
vertical integration into this industry and be able to
provide these services at very competitive rates.

purpose any statements contained in this document that are

N E I L   A N D E R S O N   D A I L Y   D E V O T I O N A L
             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

February 1

OUR TRANSFER

He delivered us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us
to the kingdom of His beloved Son (Colossians 1:13).

Perhaps you have heard the illustration of the two dogs. Some
people say that we have two natures within us vying for control
of our lives. They claim that our old sin nature, which we
inherited from disobedient Adam, is like a big black dog. Our new
nature, which we inherited through Christ's redemptive work, is
like a big white dog. These two dogs are bitter enemies, intent
on destroying each other. Whenever you involve yourself in
worldly thoughts or behavior, you are feeding the black dog.
Whenever you focus your mind and activities on spiritual things,
you are feeding the white dog. The dog you feed the most will
eventually grow stronger and overpower the other.

This dramatic illustration may motivate Christians toward saintly
behavior, but is it accurate based on who we really are in
Christ? Since God ""delivered us from the domain of darkness and
transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son"" (Colossians
1:13), can we still be in both kingdoms? When God declares that
we are ""not in the flesh but in the Spirit"" (Romans 8:9), can we
be in the flesh and in the Spirit simultaneously? When God says
that ""you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the
Lord"" (Ephesians 5:8), can you possibly be both light and
darkness? When God states that ""if any man is in Christ, he is a
new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have
come"" (2 Corinthians 5:17), can we be partly new creature and
partly old creature?

But be careful. Can a Christian sin? Of course! ""If we say that
we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not
in us"" (1 John 1:8). But having sin and being sin are two
completely different issues. When we choose to walk by the flesh
we will sin, but, as 1 John 2:1 reminds us, we don't have to: ""My
little children, I am writing these things to you that you may
not sin.""

We will spend the next few days exploring the scriptural bases
for this truth.

How liberating to know today, Lord, that I am in the light, that
I am a new creature, and that my new nature is firmly anchored in
Your work of reconciliation.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
The Greater Houston Community Foundation
The Greater Houston Community Foundation (GHCF), in collaboration with the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, the Houston Area Urban League, Crisis Intervention of Houston, and Career and Recovery Resources, have established a fund to provide dedicated support for former Enron employees.  GHCF offers former employees counseling services and helps them work with mortgage companies, landlords and utilities to defer monthly bills while they are out of work.   If you are interested in making a tax-deductible donation to the GHCF, please call 713-268-6458 or mail donations to GHCF at 4550 Post Oak Place, Suite 317, Houston, TX  77027.

Latest price: 30 cents


Take a close look at TERRA SYSTEMS (Pink Sheets: TSYI) -
latest price: 30 cents - which has just released the
following news.

The group behind TSYI is the same people who put together
ETGP. When they got involved in ETGP, the stock was trading
at a similar price (20 - 25 cents). It lifted to 50 - 60
cents in a short period of time. ETGP did a 10 for 1
reverse (not needed in TSYI) so that it traded $5.00 -
$6.00 in July of 1995 on the Bulletin Board. The stock went
to $66.00 in September of 1995 and split two for one. The
whole transaction took less than a year.

Company's patented Pneumatic Accelerator technology.

The title of the report is ``Dry Bulk Materials Handling
Technology With Emphasis On Coal.'' The report's
conclusions are positive concerning TSYI technology's
technical and economic feasibility. In part because TSYI is
still a development-stage company, La Mancha's report cites
certain caveats including that ``...these general
conclusions must be adequately measured and documented in
rigorous pilot-test environments such as those proposed by
TSYI....''

The Summary Statement of the La Mancha Report says: ``In
conclusion, the process and its potential application to
utilization in coal-fired power generation, the recovery of
usable coal fines from long-accumulating waste sites, and
its environmentally ''friendly`` attributes, constitute an
intriguing and innovative approach to assisting in
reconciling the current dichotomy of energy demand and
environmental concern. The proposed Phase I Program (of
Terra Systems) should be supported as a first step.''

Commenting on this study, Clayton Timothy, Chairman of
TSYI, said: ``We are very pleased with the positive
conclusions about our technology that this report has
reached. The La Mancha Company is a prestigious scientific
consulting firm; and, in this case, two of the authors of
the report hold Ph.D.s in relevant physical sciences and
are also retirees from the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
We recognize the challenges TSYI faces in achieving
successful commercialization, including those mentioned in
this report. But, we also feel this study provides
substantial professional support for the faith we have in
the scientific and economic efficacy of the Company's
unique process for dry bulk materials handling.''

Terra Systems, Inc. was incorporated in Utah in 1996 and is
presently a development-stage company. It is primarily
engaged in the development and commercialization of its
patented Pneumatic Accelerator. This device is a gas linear
particle accelerator, which conveys and processes bulk
materials at high velocity in a particle-isolated state,
using air as the medium of movement. This technology
operates efficiently at ambient temperatures and at low
pressures and does not use water, the generally more costly
traditional alternative for processing bulk materials.
Virtually, all organic and inorganic bulk materials used in
basic industries can be more economically separated and
classified by our dry-process technology. This capability
facilitates a number of associated procedures, including:
drying, micro pulverizing, mixing, forming, conveying, and
loading. In addition, bulk materials can be beneficiated in
important ways including moisture reduction, ash reduction,
Btu enhancement, and electro-customization. Our system can
perform multiple tasks, needs less maintenance, requires no
chemical additives, and can improve the surrounding
environmental quality. Opportunities are seen for many
applications in an array of large industries including
power generation, agriculture, mining, environment,
construction, ceramics, and materials transportation.
We estimate that our technology could generate economic
returns to industrial users in the form of revenues and/or
cost savings in the area of $2 billion within a few years,
if adopted for implementation in several large projects.
Terra Systems anticipates it will share in these economic
returns through fees, royalties, and profit sharing from
licensing of its technology. TSYI has approximately 18
million shares currently outstanding.

A HIGHER PRIORITY

For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of
God (Romans 8:14).

Two significant events in my life brought into clear focus the
priority of relationship over achievement. Before being called
into the ministry, I worked as an aerospace engineer on the
Apollo program. I will never forget the day the lunar lander
touched down on the moon. This bold headline dominated the front
page of the Minneapolis Star: ""Neil Armstrong Lands on the Moon.""
It was an achievement I was proud to be part of.

But the really big news came months earlier on page 7 in the
third section: ""Heidi Jo Anderson, born to Mr. and Mrs. Neil
Anderson, Northwestern Hospital, March 12, 1969."" That may not
sound like big news to you, but it was to her mother and me.
Heidi totally took over my den and captured an entire shelf in
the refrigerator. She altered our sleeping pattern and restricted
our social calendar. But she was ours to hold, to hug and to care
for.

What does God care about moon shots? They are deeds to be
outdone. Somebody will always come along and do it better, faster
and higher. What God cares about is little people like Heidi Jo
Anderson because they will be with Him forever.

The second significant event in my life was receiving my first
doctoral degree. But it turned out to be one of the most
anticlimactic days of my life. I heard no applause from heaven,
and I don't believe my achievement added so much as an asterisk
to my name in the Lamb's Book of Life. I was a child of God
before that day and I was still a child of God afterward.

But what happens in heaven when one sinner repents? Applause!
Why? Because a relationship with God is eternal, while earthly
achievements last only for time. Have you sacrificed the eternal
to gain the temporal? Have you ignored personal and spiritual
relationships in your pursuit of human achievements?
Relationships must always have a higher priority than temporal
achievements.

Lord, amidst the busyness of my schedule and clutter of my
possessions, help me cherish and nurture my relationships today.

IDENTIFYING A CHRISTIAN LEADER

There will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly
introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who
bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves (2 Peter
2:1).

What comes to mind when you hear the terms false prophets and
false teachers? Many people tend to thing of Eastern mystics and
gurus, the spokespersons for nonbiblical religions or dynamic
cult leaders--people who are recognizably outside the boundaries
of the Christian church. But the apostle Peter devoted an entire
chapter in one of his letters (2 Peter 2) to false prophets and
teachers who operate within the church. False teachers may
operate in our churches disguised as workers of righteousness.

Notice that the lure of false teachers is not primarily their
doctrine: ""And many will follow their sensuality, and because of
them the way of the truth will be maligned"" (verse 2). What does
Peter mean by ""follow their sensuality""? He is talking about
Christians who evaluate a ministry based on the outward
appearance and charm of its leaders. We say, ""He's such a nice
guy""; ""She's a very charismatic person""; ""He's a real dynamic
speaker""; ""She's so sweet and sounds so sincere."" But is physical
attractiveness or a syrupy personality a biblical criterion for
validating a ministry or a teacher? Of course not! The issue is
always truth and righteousness. A Christian leader should be
identified by his commitment to the truth, his righteous life and
his servant's heart.

Dear God, keep me from playing to the grandstand; I want only to
live for You. Keep me accountable as a person of truth,
righteousness, and love, ever fearful of discrediting Your name.

OUR ESSENTIAL IDENTITY

Then God said, ""Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our
likeness"" (Genesis 1:26).

Adam was created physically and spiritually alive. He possessed
eternal life from his first breath and enjoyed God's abiding
presence in the Garden of Eden.

Furthermore, unlike the animal kingdom that operated by divine
instinct, Adam was created in the likeness of God with a mind,
emotions and will, giving him the ability to think, feel and
choose. No other created being can make that claim.

After creating Adam, God said, ""It is not good for the man to be
alone"" (Genesis 2:18). So He created a suitable helper for him:
Eve. They both enjoyed a sense of belonging to God and each
other. Not only that, God gave them a purpose: to ""rule over the
fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle
and over all the earth"" (Genesis 1:26). Adam and Eve didn't have
to search for significance; they had it in their relationship
with God. And because God was present with them, they lived in
perpetual safety and security.

Eternal life, identity, purpose, significance, security and a
sense of belonging are all attributes of mankind created in the
image of God. Adam and Eve experienced these attributes in full
measure, and we were destined to enjoy them too. But when Adam
sinned, he died spiritually and forfeited everything God had
provided. Being separated from God, Adam's glowing attributes
became glaring needs.

As children of Adam born separated from God, we come into the
world with these same glaring needs. We wander though life
striving to make a name of ourselves, looking for security in
temporal things, and searching for significance apart from God.
Is it a hopeless quest? No! We are able to fulfill these needs by
establishing a personal relationship with God through faith in
Jesus Christ. Everything Adam enjoyed in the garden before he
sinned is now at our disposal.

Loving heavenly Father, thank You for sending Jesus to die for my
sin so I may have eternal life. And thank You that in Christ my
need for identity, significance, security and a sense of
belonging can be met.

RESOLVING A PAST CONFLICT

Teach me your way, O LORD, and I will walk in your truth; give me
an undivided heart (Psalm 86:11 NIV).

You have no control over a primary emotion, developed in the
past, when it is triggered. It doesn't do any good to feel guilty
about something over which you have no control. But you can seek
to resolve the past conflict and you can immediately evaluate the
present circumstance to bring it into perspective. For example,
suppose you meet a man named Bill. He looks like the Bill who
used to beat you up as a child. Even though he's not the same
person, your primary emotion initially jumps to a 3 on a scale of
10. But you mentally tell yourself that this is not the same
Bill, and you think yourself down to a 2.

You have not only used this process yourself thousands of times,
but you have also helped others do it. Someone flies off the
handle, so you grab him and tell him to get hold of himself. You
are helping that person gain control of himself by making him
think. Notice how this works the next time you're watching a
football game and tempers explode on the field. One player grabs
an enraged teammate and says, ""Listen, Meathead, you're going to
cost us a 15-yard penalty and perhaps the game if you don't
simmer down."" The player will see the conflict in perspective and
will get himself under control by thinking clearly.

Some Christians assert that the past isn't important. If you're
talking about truth, then I would agree. The truth is
truth--past, present and future. But if you are talking about
what people are actually experiencing, I would have to disagree.
Most of the people who argue that the past isn't important have
major unresolved conflicts from the past which they are not
allowing to surface. They are attempting to handle themselves by
living in denial. Either that or they are extremely fortunate to
have a conflict-free past. Those who have had major traumas and
have learned to resolve them in Christ know how devastating the
past can be to present reality.

Lord, I choose not to live in denial. Give me the grace to look
at my past and the courage to face the truth.

"RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel","RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

THE SIGNIFICANT DOMINION

Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let
them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky
and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every
creeping thing that creeps on the earth (Genesis 1:26).

In the original creation, Adam didn't search for significance; he
was significant. He was given rule over all His creatures. Was
Satan on the scene at creation? Yes. Was he the god of this world
at that time? Not at all. Who had the dominion in the garden?
Under the authority of God, Adam did, that is until Satan usurped
his dominion when Adam and Eve fell. That's when Satan became the
god of this world.

Do you realize that the significant dominion Adam exercised
before the Fall has been restored to you as a Christian? That's
part of your inheritance in Christ. Satan has no authority over
you, even though he will try to deceive you into believing that
he has. Because of your position in Christ, you have authority
over him. You are seated with Christ in the heavenlies (Ephesians
2:6).

First John 3:8 says, ""The Son of God appeared for this purpose,
that He might destroy the works of the devil."" The whole plan of
God is to restore fallen humanity and establish the kingdom of
God where Satan now reigns. This work of God is not just for our
personal victory but for all of creation. ""For the anxious
longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the
sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not of
its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that
the creation itself will also be set free from its slavery to
corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God""
(Romans 8:19-21).

Thank You, Lord, that I am part of Your redemptive plan. Show me
my responsibility so I may live a life of purpose.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families.

	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm

Onsite Confidential Counseling / 24 Hour Hotline
EAP Counselors are available for individual, confidential appointments onsite in the Enron Building or at a variety of neighborhood locations.

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel


RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

November 21

LORD, TOUCH ME

Then again He laid His hands upon his eyes; and he looked
intently and was restored, and began to see everything clearly
(Mark 8:25).

One of the greatest personal crises I have faced in the ministry
revolved around the issue of forgiveness and a board member. I
struggled relating to this man, and I knew that I couldn't
continue on the way things were. So I decided to resign my
pastorate.

The week before I was going to read my resignation to the
congregation, I got sick. I was flat on my back with a
temperature of 103.5 and I totally lost my voice. It was easy to
recognize that God wasn't pleased with my decision. I began
reading the Gospels and came upon Mark 8:22-26 where Jesus healed
the blind man. I noticed that after Jesus' first touch, the man
said, ""I see men . . . like trees"" (verse 24). I suddenly
realized that I saw this man like that: a big tree, an obstacle
blocking my path.

Then Jesus touched the blind man again and he began to see people
clearly, not as trees. I got the message. ""Lord, I don't love
this man. I know You do, and I want to. But You will have to
touch me like You did that blind man. Lord, I need You to touch
me so I can be the person You want me to be."" And God did! I
chose at that moment to forgive the man completely.

The next Sunday I went to church, not to resign, but to preach.
My voice was still so husky that I almost couldn't speak. I
confessed to the congregation my own independence and my desire
for the Lord to touch me, to see people as people, not as
obstacles to my goals. At the end of the sermon, I invited anyone
who desired a touch from the Lord to join me at the altar. Soon
the altar area and the aisles in the front were packed with
people. Eventually all but a few people had come forward. It was
a revival!

Guess who was one of the few? To my knowledge he never changed,
but I did. And I thank God to this day that He put me flat on my
back to make me the pastor He wanted me to be. If I had had my
way, I would probably be out of the ministry today.

Lord, touch me today that I may love the difficult people in my
life as You do.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

             from Freedom in Christ Ministries

January 16

THE BELIEVER'S TENT

Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground and breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
being (Genesis 2:7).

Biblically, life means to unite and death means to separate. When
Adam became a living being, his soul was in union with his body.
When he died, his soul separated from his body.

As long as you are alive, your soul is united with your body. But
when that separation occurs, you do not cease to exist. Paul said
that to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord (2
Corinthians 5:8). Your primary identity is not found in your
physical existence. Paul said, ""From now on we recognize no man
according to the flesh"" (2 Corinthians 5:16).

Even though your principal identity is more than physical, in
this temporal life you cannot function without your physical
body. Your immaterial self needs your material self, and vice
versa. You need your physical brain to control your movements and
responses, and you need your immaterial mind to reason and make
value judgments. Your brain is like a computer and your mind is
the programmer. The finest human brain can't accomplish anything
in a corpse which lacks a mind. And the most brilliant mind
cannot function in a brain damaged by Alzheimer's disease.

In 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 Paul referred to the believer's body as a
tent, the temporary dwelling place of the soul. Using his
illustration, I must confess that my tent pegs are coming up, my
poles are sagging, and my seams are becoming frayed! At my age
I'm just glad that there's more to me than the disposable earth
suit I walk around in.

You don't exist for your body; it exists for you. That's why Paul
said, ""I beat my body and make it my slave"" (1 Corinthians 9:27
NIV). In order to fulfill your purpose for being here, you need
to manage your body well through exercise, balanced diet and
adequate rest.

Lord, help me to not overemphasize or underemphasize the
significance of my physical life but stay in step with Your view.

(Ephesians 6:15).

The next piece of armor is the shoes of peace. When you receive
Christ, you are united with the Prince of Peace. You have peace
with God right now (Romans 5:1), but the peace of Christ must
also rule in your heart if you are going to live victoriously,
and that is possible only when you let the Word of Christ richly
dwell in you (Colossians 3:15, 16).

The shoes of peace become protection against the divisive schemes
of the devil when you act as a peacemaker among believers (Romans
14:19). Peacemakers bring people together by promoting fellowship
and reconciliation. ""Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall
be called sons of God"" (Matthew 5:9). Anyone can divide a
fellowship, but it takes the grace of God to unite us in Him.

Too many Christians insist on common doctrine as the basis for
fellowship. They reason that if we don't think the same and
believe the same, there is no basis for peace. But common
doctrine isn't the basis for fellowship; common heritage is.
We're all children of God. If you wait to fellowship with someone
until you agree perfectly on every point of doctrine, you'll be
the loneliest Christian on earth. Instead of insisting on the
unity of the mind, preserve the unity of the Spirit by taking the
initiative to be the peacemaker in your relationships (Ephesians
4:3).

Some people like to play the devil's advocate in their
relationships and churches. I ask, Why? He doesn't need any help!
In His high priestly prayer, Jesus prayed, ""I in them, and Thou
in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, that the world may
know that Thou didst send Me"" (John 17:23). We have the promise
that ""the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet""
(Romans 16:20). Ask God to use you to bring unity to your
relationships by making you a peacemaker.

Heavenly Father, use me today to bring unity to Your family.
Enable me to be a peacemaker.

Fruitful Suffering

...""It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my
suffering.""
- (Genesis 41:52)


Joseph named his second son Ephraim. Ephraim was given to him
after he had been delivered from his suffering of 13 years.
Joseph said that he named him this because God had made him
fruitful in the land of his suffering. Ephraim means ""twice
fruitful.""

Joseph was fruitful in two instances. He was fruitful during his
time of adversity and in his prosperity. When God brings us into
a time of suffering, it can be a fruitful time. It's rare for us
to see the fruit during the suffering period. But know that the
roots are going deep into the spiritual soil of our soul because
of our pressing in to God during our time of suffering. This is
producing a work in our character that cannot be seen until it
finishes the process. Such was the case for Joseph.

It was not until several years after such a time of suffering
that I began to see the fruit of the trials that the Lord allowed
me to experience. How grateful I am to understand some of the
""why"" that has led to a new life in Him that I would never have
had without this period.

Samson had great anointing but lacked character. We see many
today who have great anointing yet lack character. But God is
raising up Josephs who not only have great anointing for these
days but also great character. Suffering produces character.

If you find yourself in a time of suffering, now is the time to
press into God. Let your roots grow deeper. Whenever there is a
famine, tree roots are forced to drive deeper into the soil to
find water. These times are designed to create such a deep-rooted
faith that our natures will be changed forever.

Loose Your Donkey

...""Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a
donkey ttied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring
them to Me. If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the
Lord needs them....""
- (Matthew 21:2-3)


A donkey was an animal of commerce in Jesus' day. It was used to
carry great burdens of goods from place to place and he was known
as the ""beast of the burden."" This donkey no doubt was owned by a
village businessperson. But Jesus told His disciples to fetch the
donkey for ""He had need of it."" This donkey played an important
part in Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem. It was a day that
was the culmination of three years of ministry. Jesus chose to
use a vehicle of commerce to bring Him into His most important
public display.

We are entering a time in our own history in which God is saying
to businesspeople, ""Loose your donkey for My purposes. I have
need of it."" God is preparing His Church to be a vessel for
ushering in a great harvest of souls. He is preparing His remnant
of businesspeople, who are like a tribe within the Church, to be
a major force in this great harvest.

""He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest
branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood
of grapes. His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter
than milk"" (Gen. 49:11-12). Is your donkey tied to the living
Vine, the choicest branch of Jesus Himself? When we are tied to
the living Vine, designed for His use, we will be useful in God's
Kingdom. Jesus wants to free us from the bondage of business
slavery; He wants us to walk in freedom so that others may see
God's grace flowing through us and our place in the business
world. Is your donkey available for His use?

Today, ask Jesus to allow the Vine to flow through you in every
area of your life.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

                       by Os Hillman

Thirsting After God

...""Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit""....
- (2 Kings 2:9)


The first requirement to move in greater power and authority in
God is to hunger for it. Yet even this hunger is born from God.
Elisha hungered after God. Elisha saw many miracles as Elijah's
servant. But he wanted more. He wanted a double portion of
Elijah's spirit. When he asked Elijah for this, the prophet
responded, ""You have asked a difficult thing."" It wasn't because
it couldn't be granted. Elijah knew that with great anointing
came a great weight of responsibility and difficulty.

Second, humility comes before honor. Elisha was known as the
""servant of Elijah."" How would you like to be known as ""the
servant of John""? Your name is not even mentioned. This was the
preparation of Elisha. It has been the preparation of many men of
God. Consider Joseph, the servant of Pharaoh. Consider David, the
servant of Saul.

Third, Elisha committed himself totally to his calling. The
Scripture says when Elisha was called to join Elijah, the younger
man left his farm business completely. He slaughtered his oxen
and had a great feast for the community. It was all or nothing.
He could not fall back on his farm trade if his new venture
didn't work. This demonstrates Elisha's pioneer spirit in
stepping out, not knowing what was ahead.

Do you want greater anointing in God? ""You will seek Me and find
Me when you seek Me with all your heart. I will be found by you""
(Jer. 29:13-14a). Begin thirsting for God's anointing in your
heart today. This is the starting place.

Placing Trust in Our Strength

So the Lord sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of
Israel fell dead.
- (1 Chronicles 21:14)


When was the last time your overconfidence cost the lives of
70,000 men? That is exactly what happened to David. David made
what might appear to be an innocent request of his general, Joab.
But the minute Joab heard the request, he cringed. He knew David
was in big trouble for this one. You see, to number the troops
was a great sin in Israel because it was against the law. Why?
Because it demonstrated that you were placing more trust in
numbers than in the living God. David displayed enough pride to
cost the lives of 70,000 fighting men. God gave him three choices
of punishment for his sin. A plague was the one he chose, and it
resulted in the loss of 70,000.

Throughout Israel's history, God set the stage for battles to be
won, miracles to take place, and people to exercise faith. The
stage was always set so that man could not take credit for what
God did. Consider Gideon who was only allowed 300 men to fight an
army of 100,000. Consider Jehoshaphat, who had to lead his army
with his singers. God defeated the enemy. Consider Joshua, who
was told simply to walk around Jericho seven times, and they
would get victory. God did things in some very unconventional
ways!

How does this relate to you and me as businesspeople? Well, the
minute you and I place more trust in our abilities than in God,
we are guilty of numbering the troops. How does He punish us?
Sometimes it's through letting a deal go sour. Sometimes it's
through problems with a client or vendor. Sometimes situations
just blow up in our face. Other times, He lets us go on for a
long time doing our own thing, but eventually He deals with it.

The lesson here is to learn daily and complete dependence on God.
Use your gifts and abilities through the power of the Holy
Spirit. Ask Him daily for direction and wisdom. His ways won't
always line up with conventional wisdom. When we begin depending
on our abilities only, God has a responsibility to make known to
us who is the giver of the blessings.

"Final Benefits Memo","
 
In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

the story of Rabbi Akiba, who was imprisoned. Rabbi Joshua
brought him some water, but the guard spilled half of the
container. There was too little water to both wash and drink, and
Rabbi Akiba faced the possibility of death for lack of water if
he chose to use the water for ceremonial washing. He reasoned,
""He who eats with unwashed hands perpetuates a crime that ought
to be punished by death. Better for me to die of thirst than to
transgress the traditions of my ancestors!""

Jesus responded harshly to such reasoning: ""You blind guides, who
strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!"" (Matthew 23:24). The Lord
cautions that the weightier matters of the law (such as justice
and mercy) are overlooked when attention focuses on strict
observances of religious practices. This leads to a corresponding
negligence of the eternal laws of God. Jesus told people to pay
more attention to cleansing their hearts and not be like their
leaders who cleanse only their hands.

The laws of God are liberating and protective. They are
restrictive only when they protect us from the evil one. The
rules of any institution should ensure the freedom of each
individual to reach his or her God-given potential. They should
serve as a guide so we don't stray from our purpose, and they
should protect us from those who abuse the system.

The principle that Jesus modeled could be stated as follows: If
people are commanded to follow a traditional practice that makes
life more difficult and no longer contributes to the purpose of
the organization, then we must not participate as a matter of
religious conscience. Jesus simply didn't observe such
traditions, and He defended His disciples for not observing them
as well.

Thank You for reminding me, Lord, that the law kills but the
Spirit gives life. Help me walk in that freedom today.
