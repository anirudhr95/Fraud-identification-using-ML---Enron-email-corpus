Subject: FW: Big Boy harvested


Jeff Duncan of Sanger, Texas shot the deer they call ""Big Boy"" at Hagerman
National Wildlife Refuge in Grayson County with a bow on Sunday afternoon.
His gross B&C score green score is 234 3/8, and net green score is 230
6/8.
He will be a new Texas state archery record.  The deer is believed to be
10.5 years old, at least.  He has been photographed and videoed several
times in the past, and was actually shot 2 years ago on private land, but
the arrow passed through his hindquarters, and he survived.
Congratulations
to Jeff.  The story will probably be in Sunday's Dallas Morning News.
Jeff hasn't quit smiling since Sunday.

Subject:	Vacation Time

Just a reminder that we are coming up to the end of the year and that you will be able to roll over 40 HOURS or ONE WEEK of vacation time.  Should you have more that 40 hours please try and use them before the end of the year so that you don't loose them.  I do have a print out of the vacation time if you need to verify your current balance.

Thank you,

Jeff

I am tentatively planning a trip to Houston for the weekend of Nov 16th.
Seeing just a few accounts while I'm there and I am hoping to get a round of
golf in for that Saturday.  I am hoping you can take the time to allow me to
kick your ass on the links.  What do you say?  I will let you know when my
plans are finalized.
