"U2.COM Update - October 19th 2001","Dear U2.Com Member,

Several items of news for fans this week: award nominations, exclusive U2
video and new Elevation 2001 tour items. Let's list them to keep it simple.

- The Awards Season is upon us and U2 are up for prizes at several
prestigious events. If you'd like to see them win, cast your votes
by following the links below.

First off the band are up for 'Best Album', 'Best Live Act' and 'Best Band In
The World Today' in the annual Awards of the UK's Q Magazine.
Add your vote here
http://www.processrequest.com/quickstart/LeadCapture/Display_LeadCapture.asp?e=XbcagcabBC-RaA&oid=UchcaBB

U2 are also up for prizes - against Limp Bizkit and Gorillaz no less - in the
MTV Europe Awards. It's the fans who decide and U2 are up for Best Group,
Best Album, Best Rock Act and best Web Site (that's us!). Make your vote
count here - http://ema.mtv.co.uk/uk/content/voting.shtml


- At U2.COM we have just posted exclusive new video of the band performing
at the recent Video Music Awards. Watch it here ( http://www.u2.com/lite ).
In the next few days we'll be carrying the new Walk On video directed by
Jonas Akerland and the US video for Stuck In A Moment.

- We are now carrying several new items of clothing in the U2.Com shop, from
hooded sweatshirts to t-shirts. Check out the whole range here
( http://shop.u2.com/ )

- We hope to launch our interactive fan-based Zootopia area on U2.Com within
days - we'll let you know first. Meantime, don't forget to check back with
the site regularly. As the band continues their record-breaking Elevation
2001 Tour, we're posting fresh band news stories most days
( http://www.u2.com/lite ) - as well as reports and reviews of each show.


Best wishes

"5K Freedom Run on Veteran's Day","WE WANT YOU! Please join Dallas in celebrating America at The Freedom Run
(www.thefreedomrun.com )on Veteran's Day, Saturday, November 10, 2001. The 5
K Run/Walk begins at 8:30 AM at the American Airlines Center. The Dallas
Association of Young Lawyers' Leadership Class, which is organizing this
event, is looking for runners, walkers, and volunteers to participate in the
walk/run. Volunteers are needed on race day from 6:30 AM until the course is
complete. In addition to being part of this patriotic event, volunteers will
receive a complimentary T-shirt (red, white, and blue, of course!). Our goal
for this family event is to fill the race course and festival site with an
outpouring of patriotism in tribute to the heroes and victims of September
11. There will be activities for all, including those who choose not to run,
walk, or volunteer. There is literally something for everyone, and all
proceeds will go to the American Red Cross's September 11th Fund. A ""Freedom
Wall"" will also be available for you to record a message to those affected
by the tragic events last month, and the Wall will then be sent from Dallas
to New York for display.  If you are interested in participating in the
race, you may sign up at the website listed above.

Eric seems to think he is in charge of this little outing. But, he is
mistaken because I am the gatekeeper of the tickets. If you have any
questions regarding the Wings Over Houston Airshow this Sunday, please
direct them to me. Thanks for your cooperation.



   This just in from Ellington Field to me.







                                    Please Note!


          Due to heightened security at all airports across the United

          States, the following rules have been issued by the FAA and

          local officials concerning attendance at our airshow:

               Because of heightened security all backpacks, coolers and

               tote bags must be left in the car and will not be allowed

               on the field.



          These rules will be enforced by officials at the gates and on

          the grounds. Your cooperation and understanding is appreciated.

"Caselaw, Cheese and Syrup...","From: Mark Whitney
TheLaw.net Corporation
Homepage: http://www.thelaw.net
Remove: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

  By late November folks aren't thinking about legal research, they're thinking about food. Our answer:

--discount subscriptions to TheLaw.net for the month of November by up to 20%
--send you something sharp and something sweet

  Subscribe to TheLaw.net before the end of November and we'll immediately direct the farm families of the Cabot Creamery in Cabot, Vermont, to ship you a pint of their pure Vermont Maple Syrup and a pound of their Vintage Vermont Cheddar. See, http://www.cabotcheese.com
see also http://www.thelaw.net/cabotoffer.htm


?AND SAVE 20% ON THELAW.NET CONVENIENCE EDITION!

  Just $395 (save $100!) on TheLaw.net Convenience Edition. TheLaw.net is a custom legal browser. It is very easy to use. $395 covers you for a year. You have unlimited access to everything. Install at work at home and on your laptop and feel-free to hand the software off to your trusted assistant at no extra charge. And did we mention there's a 30-day unconditional money back guarantee.

  Our Small Office Special is on sale, too, and the prices for multi-user Workgroups look even more attractive. See, http://www.thelaw.net/subscribe.htm

  Of course, our large competitors' databases have been a work in progress for generations. But, times have changed. A judicial opinion does not take on greater precedential value merely because it's fed to you via a WestLaw pipeline. It just costs more to read it. If you take a look at the searchable case law database you'll have UNLIMITED access to with TheLaw.net we stack up quite nicely, particularly when you consider the price.
See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm

  By deploying TheLaw.net in your world you may discover that:

----your online productivity increases ten fold
----the list of expensive subscription items is much shorter
----it makes sense to turn to the big guns only when you cannot otherwise find the answer elsewhere, faster, cheaper.


?UNRESOLVED MANAGEMENT ISSUES

  Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues when it comes to choosing legal research resources?

     --What do you do when you have to research across state lines?

     --What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits?

     --Our subscribers snicker to themselves, click a checkbox to search all states or all Federal and they pay not one thin additional dime for the privilege. (See covered jurisdictions listed below the signature line.)


""I AM IN MY SWEATS DOING BILLABLE RESEARCH. I LOVE IT!""

     And there you have our new favorite quote, from a new subscriber leaving a large firm to start her own thing. We have others; lots of them. See, http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm

     What's not to like?

--TheLaw.net is less than $1 a day for an individual annual subscription to our Solo Edition. Even less per day, per workgroup user. See, http://www.thelaw.net/susbcribe.htm

--Enter a statutory cite into the search engine, and pop up cases construing that item, in one mouse click. See, http://www.thelaw.net/statutes.htm

--Have a case citation you need to know more about? Find cases construing that item in one mouse click. Simple.

--Easy to use? Do you know how to operate a browser, shuttle through little windows folders and do electronic case law research? If so, you're on your way to being a guru using TheLaw.net. If you don't know how to perform these tasks, we will teach at no cost.

--PERFORM UNKNOWN ITEM SEARCHES: Use Boolean and, or, not, near, within, adjacent, nesting, truncation See, Sample Searches: http://www.thelaw.net/searchdemo/home.htm

--PERFORM KNOWN ITEM SEARCHES: Field search by cite, party, counsel, docket, author, date or panel.  See, http://www.thelaw.net/help/operators.htm

Subject:	West Virginia title received

Okay, all.  I am sure there is a very good deal behind this, but do any of you know where the recently received, state of West Virginia title to a used trailer belongs?  The year of the trailer is 1995, the make of the trailer is ""NORS"", and the serial number is N01020318TN.  The title was issued by WV on 09/26/01 to Enron North America Corp., no lienholder (well, that's a good fact!).

Please ask around your groups regarding who is interested in holding on to this title.  Unless otherwise notified, I am going to have it sent to the vault.  Please call me if you know to whom it should be directed.

2) UNDER THE HOOD:
You're in (Re)Charge Part II: Jump-Starting Your Car

In last month's MapQuest newsletter, we gave a few ways to keep your car battery charged and vital. Our suggestions of buying trusted, name-brand batteries and performing regular cleanings can help decrease the threat of sudden battery death at an inconvenient moment. But batteries don't live forever, so with a pair of jumper cables, the help of a friendly citizen and the following easy steps, you might suffer an inconvenience when your battery goes, but you won't be stranded.

--Put both cars in park, facing each other but not touching, with emergency brakes on and engines shut off.

--Remove the caps from both cars' batteries.

--Use the red cable first, affixing one clamp to the positive terminal on each cars' battery. (The positive terminal should be marked with a + or the letters POS)

--Use the black cable second, affixing one end to the other car's negative battery terminal (often marked with a minus sign or the letters NEG) and the other to a piece of unpainted metal on your car that is at least a couple feet away from your battery and carburetor.

--Double check your connections! Today's electronic ignitions can be sensitive and costly to repair if recharged incorrectly.

--Start your car. Expect to take a leisurely drive of up to half-an-hour as your battery recharges (don't shut it off until you're in a safe place, just in case!). If your car does not start on the first attempt, try starting the other car and letting it idle for a bit, then shut it off and try again. If it's a no-go after one or two tries, it's probably time for a new battery.

3) TRAVEL DEALS:
Free Foliage Part II: Fall is for Frugal and Lavish Alike

Meet Sam and Tara. They wear Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. She's got a Volvo, he's got a BMW. Their Friday night pizzas are topped with exotic vegetables and imported cheeses.

Meet Jed and Courtney. Their idea of a fun Saturday is flea market hopping in their VW bus that still has shaggy carpet in back. Their idea of pizza is $1-a-slice take out.

November to August, these two couples have little in common. But during fall foliage season, weekend leaf peeping becomes a common ground upon which the thrifty and the extravagant can agree. For two months, the ""deal"" is inherent in the season.

As beautiful as those New England covered brides and old farmhouses are, stopping in the road or trespassing to take pictures isn't always a good idea. The answer? Take advantage of the nation's most treasured land -- head to the National forests and parks.

We can't give you an exhaustive list of the nation's best foliage spots within this newsletter, but here a just a few pared-down suggestions to peak (no pun intended) your interest.

Disclaimer: We know it's nearly impossible to throw a stick anywhere between Connecticut and Maine without hitting some gorgeous foliage. So choosing just one New England route is tough. But Kancamagus Highway in New Hampshire is a favorite for a slew of reasons. Some of the most spectacular autumn hues in the nation, views of the stunning White Mountains, the Appalachian Trail, water falls and rivers, historical sites, a 3,700-foot mountain summit and outlet shopping and excellent coffee shops nearby, just in case you're inclined to buy a sleeping bag, camp out for the night, and wake up to a cup of morning joe.

""Never,"" says one New Hampshire native who spends nearly every fall weekend in the region. ""Never will I get used to the Appalachian (trail) in the fall. The day I do is the day I'm no longer alive.""

If you can't make it to New England, don't fret. The eastern seaboard is sprinkled with fantastic foliage posts. Those wanting to visit the Chatahoochee-Oconee National Forests in Georgia, for example, are probably receiving this newsletter right amid the region's peak season. The forest's miles and miles of hiking trails, 25 designated camp sites, white water rafting and horseback riding are just a few foliage-friendly draws.

When flying into the northwest corner of the country, it's apparent that Mt. Saint Helens isn't the only thing capable of eruption. Blinding reds and yellows are one of the main attractions in Gifford Pinchot National Forest come fall time. And while you'll just miss the huckleberry picking season, you might be inclined to break up your leaf peeping stints with a guided tour or geology workshop at the Mount St. Helens Institute.

We'd love to entice you further with tales of America's best 20-mile hikes and 100-mile panoramas, but this newsletter would never end. Our suggestion: Check out two very important sections of the MapQuest site for more ideas. The <link>scenic drives</link> section is a great place to start, thanks to information provided by the National Scenic Byways Program. For more information about MapQuest's guide to America's National Parks, see the On MapQuest section at the end of this newsletter.

4) ON MAPQUEST:
Follow the Yellow Leafed Road

Question: What do all these words have in common?
-Acadia
-Sequoia
-Shenandoah
-Isle Royale
-Hot Springs

If you guessed ""they're all national parks,"" you should treat yourself to a nice Saturday afternoon hike and a bottled water. If you also guessed ""they're all detailed on MapQuest's National Parks guide"" you should throw in an extra energy bar and a few rolls of film.

It's foliage season, and the perfect time to bask in fall's colors in national park. So what kind of details can you garner from MapQuest's guide to America's treasures? As you'd expect, you'll find excellent park, trail, street and atlas maps as well as directions to and around the area. You'll also get contact information, topographic details, area scenic drive suggestions as well as camping, hiking, fishing, boating, picnicking, and hunting information.

Just one warning: Your romantic weekend plans to the Badlands could easily turn into a full-fledged vacation.

"Re: Air Show","
Eric seems to think he is in charge of this little outing. But, he is
mistaken because I am the gatekeeper of the tickets. If you have any
questions regarding the Wings Over Houston Airshow this Sunday, please
direct them to me. Thanks for your cooperation.



   This just in from Ellington Field to me.






                                    Please Note!

          Due to heightened security at all airports across the United
          States, the following rules have been issued by the FAA and
          local officials concerning attendance at our airshow:
               Because of heightened security all backpacks, coolers and
               tote bags must be left in the car and will not be allowed
               on the field.


          These rules will be enforced by officials at the gates and on
          the grounds. Your cooperation and understanding is appreciated.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"Funny...","
 I  usually don't forward these but this one is particularly frightening
to me....

Don't go to the bathroom on October 28th. CIA intelligence reports that
a major plot is planned for that day. Anyone who takes a poop on the
28th will be bitten on the ass by an alligator. Reports indicate that
organized groups of alligators are planning to rise up into unsuspecting
American's toilet bowls and bite them when they are doing their dirty
business.

I usually don't send emails like this, but I got this information from a
reliable source. It came from a friend of a friend whose cousin is
dating this girl whose brother knows this guy whose wife knows this lady
whose husband buys hotdogs from this guy who knows a shoeshine guy who
shines the shoes of a mailroom worker who has a friend who's drug dealer
sells drugs to another mailroom worker who works in the CIA building. He
apparently overheard two guys talking in the bathroom about alligators
and came to the conclusion that we are going to be attacked. So it must
be true.

Enron Economics 101

-----

Feudalism
You have two cows.
Your lord takes some of the milk.
---------

Fascism
You have two cows.
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you
the milk.
---------

Pure Communism
You have two cows.
Your neighbors help take care of them and you all share the milk.
----------

Applied Communism
You have two cows.
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.
----------

Totalitarianism
You have two cows.
The government takes them both and denies they ever existed.
Milk is banned.
----------

Pure Democracy
You have two cows.
You and your neighbors decide who gets the milk.
----------

Representative Democracy
You have two cows.
Your neighbors pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.
---------

Mexican Democracy
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.
----------

European Democracy
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking
apply.
If there aren't any, they invent some.
They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down
the drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.
----------

American Democracy
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.  After
the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow futures.
The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.
Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.
----------

Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows.
You sell them and retire on the income.
----------

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/
equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four
cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the
six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company
secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all
seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the
company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

Dear Fellow Diver;

We are watching things very closely to see what PADI can do to help the dive industry get back to business as usual.  I want to thank all of you who have sent me notes letting me know that you are still traveling, and still telling friends to get wet and try this cool sport.

We are currently evaluating incentives to encourage you to bring even more people into scuba diving, and we are asking other stakeholders in the industry to do the same.  Every study we have ever done indicates that word of mouth from friends and family brings more people into diving than anything else. So, stay tuned as we develop innovative ways to recognize and reward you for doing what you love to do anyway: tell people about the thrill and fun of scuba diving.

And, just a reminder. I'm still sending out checks to Fellow Diver Newsletter readers for $10.00 until October 31st .  To get yours, just sign up for any PADI Adventures in Diving, Rescue Diver, or Divemaster course, send me your receipt attached to your special Fellow Diver coupon and I'll send you a check. Download your coupon at http://www.padi.com/promo/dfd/ Just type in padidiver when asked for the password.

If you remember, a couple of months ago, we were trying to get Fellow Diver Newsletter readers to join us on Grand Cayman to dive with some huge country western music stars.  Well, if you didn't make it, you can read all about it in this month's issue of Country Weekly.  Travis Tritt and SheDaisy tell you about their great experiences as PADI Divers during Cayman Country.  You can also see story summaries on the PADI Today Home page at http://www.padi.com

Speaking of travel, as you know, the travel industry has been hit hard by the events of September 11th.  I just wanted to thank all of you who participated in our online survey at http://www.padi.com about your future travel plans.  As of this moment, 68 percent of divers taking the survey are not changing existing travel plans.  Of the 32 percent who are changing their plans, about 90 percent are only changing the dates or the destination of their travel.  That means only 10 percent of divers taking the survey are permanently canceling their trips.  Please do your best to support the airline, hospitality, and resort sectors of the world economy and book a dive trip soon.

According to our information, now that the summer dive season is winding down in the northern hemisphere, literally hundreds of PADI Dive Centers and Resorts are gearing up for PADI Seal Team programs.  Earlier this year, PADI launched this program for kids eight and older.  They get to do AquaMissions like Creature ID, Environment, Navigation, and Snapshot specialist.  Check it out at http://www.padisealteam.com/what.asp  or call your local PADI Dive Center.  If you take your children, nieces or nephews into a PADI Dive Center or Resort and sign them up for the PADI Seal Team program, I'll do my best to get them on the PADI Home Page where more than 10,000 of your fellow divers will see them every day. Just send me a photo or two of them taken during the program, along with the name of the PADI facility. You can send photos and stories to me a brianc@padi.com

Until next month, get a friend (signed up for The PADI Open Water Diver course) and go diving!  They'll thank you for doing it!

When Is A Software Invention Actually Ready For Patenting?    The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently affirmed  a District Court decision of patent invalidity under the on-sale  provisions of 35 U.S.C. ?102(b). Robotic Vision Sys.,  Inc. v. View Eng'g, Inc and General Scanning, Inc., 249 F.3d  1307 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Federal Circuit applied the new two  prong on-sale bar test from Wayne K. Pfaff v. Wells Elecs.,  Inc., 525 U.S. 55 (1998).    In the Pfaff case, the Supreme Court, referred to drawings  and other descriptions of an invention as proof that the invention  is complete and hence ready for patenting. Using the new Pfaff  test, the Federal Circuit held in the Robotic Vision case that a software invention was ready  for patenting when one of the inventors verbally described the invention  to a co-worker in sufficient detail to allow him to practice it,  even though the actual software used to practice the invention  did not exist before the on-sale bar date.    The Robotic Vision case helps illustrate the dynamic nature  of patent law used to protect high-tech inventions. It also illustrates  the caution that must be exercised when attempting to protect  high-tech inventions including methods that are implemented with  software. The conduct of inventors as well as marketing or sales  materials that could describe details of software inventions must  now receive more scrutiny to avoid inadvertent on-sale bars under  ?102(b).

Show





Eric seems to think he is in charge of this little outing. But, he is
mistaken because I am the gatekeeper of the tickets. If you have any
questions regarding the Wings Over Houston Airshow this Sunday, please
direct them to me. Thanks for your cooperation.



   This just in from Ellington Field to me.







                                    Please Note!


          Due to heightened security at all airports across the United

          States, the following rules have been issued by the FAA and

          local officials concerning attendance at our airshow:

               Because of heightened security all backpacks, coolers and

               tote bags must be left in the car and will not be allowed

               on the field.



          These rules will be enforced by officials at the gates and on

          the grounds. Your cooperation and understanding is appreciated.

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

DEAR RECEIVER,

You have just received a Taliban virus. Since we are
not so technologically advanced in Afghanistan, this
is a MANUAL virus.

Please delete all the files on your hard disk yourself
and send this mail to everyone you know.

Thank you very much for helping me.
