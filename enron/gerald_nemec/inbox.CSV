You are right.  It was our mistake of executing the wrong  agreement.
 
We will take your 2nd alternative:
 
2. Leave the Inside Ferc. reference for July and change  Aug - Oct. to
enable future hedging opportunities. We would need to create  an

Subject: Revised Cover Page to Price  Confirm
I noticed that Mexicana and ENA inadvertantly executed the  confirm that
referenced an ""Inside FERC"" Socal Border Index. I believe that  we had
revised the paperwork to reflect a ""Natural Gas Intelligence""  Socal
Border Price since that is the index used for fianancial settlement  in
the basis markets.  
The Inside FERC index is new (started  in March 2001) and reflects an
index of $4.76 for July whereas NGI  published $4.70. Should you elect to
hedge August, Sept and/or October, we  would need to amend the agreement
to reflect the NGI posting.
Here  are our options:
1. Substitue the first page of the confirm (I would  need to send it back
to you for initials) for July - Oct.
2. Leave the  Inside Ferc. reference for July and change Aug - Oct. to
enable future  hedging opportunities. We would need to create an
amendment for NGI if you  want to go this route.
Please call me to discuss at your earliest  convenience - I will be out
of the office this afternoon but back Monday  morning.

"RE: Aspect Contracts","Gerald, a couple of comments...
1) Pricing does not change until 1/102, nor do other provisions like the keep whole, The way you have the contracts drafted, it is as if we have new terms beginning now. I think the producers will object to this and think we are trying to put something over on them now. Can we make the new contracts effective 1/1/02?

2) Under Art. 2 Contract price....I have a questions about the 80% of ""First of the Month Nomination""...what about the 5% swing they get...Shouldn't it be 80% of actuals, subject to the keep whole? Maybe I am the one confused, but could you please call me to discuss. Thanks.

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Subject:	NNG Hubbard

Stuart,  I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements:

All these contracts are in Enron North America Corp.'s name

1.  Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one.  We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings.  NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement)  This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities.  No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  Thus it is not terminated.  If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year.  Term is through January 31, 2018.

2.  First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997.  NNG operates the electric driver for ENA.  Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater.  Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above.  Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period).  

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

3.  Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997.  ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative.  Term is through December 31, 2017.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

4.  Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995.  ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation. This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69.

	Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default.  GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default.  If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the ""Stipulated Loss Value"" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder.  The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement.

Let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements.

"Schedule For Territorial Dispute","

Gerald,

See the attached schedule for Docket 010441, the Gulf/WFEC dispute.

There is no schedule yet for the Gulf rate hearing. We expect that in early
October and I will forward it to you.

You asked about the effect of intervention in the rate case on the
territorial dispute. In addressing this question it is useful to know that
the FPSC rate hearing intervention rules are very liberal        (Enron can
intervene at any time) and that the rate case will not proceed rapidly. For
procedural purposes, a prompt intervention decision is not necessary.

Also, I think that Gulf has the stronger position in the territorial
dispute. Because an Enron intervention in the rate case could confuse the
staff and raise questions from WFEC, I think it best from ECS's perspective
to await a decision in the territorial dispute before petitioning for
intervention.



I've reviewed the questions in Harry Kingerski's e-mail that you forwarded.
Preliminarily, I note two corrections. First, we expect a decision in the
territorial dispute in early December, not November. Second, Harry said
that;

      ""Gulf proposed surcharge treatment for the capital costs of Smith
earlier this year, but eventually withdrew the application because the PPA
it was trying to get in place, whereby Southern would take ownership of the
plant and sell energy and capacity back to Gulf, drew a lot of flack"".

I don't know if it matters, but Susan Clark was told that Gulf withdrew the
application because the discovery order in the docket would have required
the release of Southern Company strategic planning material that Southern
considered very confidential. Withdrawal was preferable to disclosure. (I
recognize that this may be only Gulf's ""spin"" on the withdrawal and they may
have withdrawn for exactly the reason Harry suggests.)

The strategic questions posed in Harry's e-mail are complex and involve more
than one Enron entity. His questions defy a prompt response, at least from
us. We suggest that it would be useful to convene a meeting in Houston,
including us and a representative from each wholly-owned and potentially
affected Enron entity. That would facilitate the development and
handicapping of a regulatory stance that is best for Enron. Susan's
experience as a Florida Commissioner for nine years (and General Counsel for
years before that) is useful in understanding the factors that inform
staff's recommendations as well as a Commissioner's decisions in this
context. (I've attached Susan's information.)

Let me know what you would like us to do.

Bill

Dear Fellow Diver:

Well, it's been a while, but we have been busy.  Here's a brief rundown on what's been happening.  In the United Kingdom PADI received some great exposure for the PADI Seal Team Program when the BBC's children television series Blue Peter did a whole segment on the Scouts in the UK taking up the Seal Team program.  Here is a link to the Scout website so you can learn more; http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/activity/outdoor/adventure/scubascout.htm

Speaking of the PADI Seal Team, they made an appearance in October at the Scuba Extasea Expo in Denver, Colorado, USA.  They were signing autographs and having a great time.  Shina, Blade, Kiros, Daria and Alano even had their pictures taken with real-life U.S. Navy Seals.  It was great.

By now, you should have received two special Fellow Diver newsletters inviting you to bring three friends into scuba diving and receive a $50.00 check from PADI.  I'm happy to report that the program is a big success!  The scuba industry at large is jumping on the bandwagon developing associated offers for those of you who show them your PADI check.  We will be doing our best to keep track of the many offers so that we can keep you informed.  Please keep checking the PADI website and be on the look out for more special newsletters.

I did receive quite a few e-mails about the PADI Diving Society.  Currently, there are two PADI Diving Societies. One is based in the US and the other is based in the UK and serves that region. The official publication of the PADI Diving Society in the US is Sport Diver magazine. I encourage you to visit their site at; www.sportdiver.com to learn more about Society membership and the magazine. And, PADI Diving Society members receive another $25.00 from Sport Diver when three friends or family members receive their PADI Open Water Diver certification. Sport Diver also has a great email newsletter you can receive for free. Just drop in and register online at http://www.sportdiver.com/idiver

The holidays are quickly sneaking up on us.  So what scuba-related gift can you give your friends or family?  Here is an idea.  We recently added cool post cards to the padi.com website.  One is a gift certificate for $10.00 off the PADI Open Water Diver course.  Send friends or family members the post card and when they follow the simple directions and complete the Open Water Diver course, they get $10.00 directly from PADI.  Just follow this link: www.padi.com/fun/postcard2  And don't forget to wish them happy holidays.  It's a nice gift that doesn't cost you a thing.

If you happened to be in the Cayman Islands the first week of November, you might have met Michelle.  ""She"" was the hurricane that came blowing through literally hours before PADI Diving Society's Total Submersion Event.  Despite this, Sunset House, a PADI Gold Palm Resort, and the event's host hotel did an incredible job of making everyone feel at home.

If you were at Total Submersion, you would have seen something unusual. Me diving next to a mermaid! That's right, I dove the Mermaid off Sunset House and have pictures to prove it!  Take a look at http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/mermaid/. Despite the initial bad weather, more than 70 people had a fabulous week.  Please consider joining us next year at this fantastic event.  Details will be posted on the PADI website as they become available.

I know this is getting a little long, so until next time, get a friend (or three) and go diving. And, drop me a line to let me know about your latest dive adventure.

Here are the documents on the Questar open seasons that Stephanie discussed with you.  Since the precedent agreements are binding, we would like to put in some sort of contingency clause to give Enron a potential out.  Unfortunately, we only have the PAs in pdf format, so we may need to just write in whatever language we need.

The Denver office will be meeting with Questar on Tuesday or Wednesday to discuss the open season details, and we can touch base after then.  

Have a good holiday weekend.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"RE: GTC clearing report","Stacey,

I did have one concern regarding the report. I noticed that several of the counterparties that I noted as needing masters had zeroes for the count of GTC Firm confirms. When I ran a search on them, there were several GTC Wellhead or GTC Pooling Point contracts. Can you check on those counterparties with zero to see why they are not showing contracts?

Judy,

Attached is a very simple report I pulled together on those ENA Upstream counterparties you are trying to get masters in place with.  I ran a Sitara report to check those names against two GTC types that weren't already reported under my regular report:  Committed Reserves GTC and Wellhead Pooling Point GTC.  I'll email you my regular report and I can run something like that in the future once you decide on the threshold levels you'd like to see.

Judy,

For ENA, we have set thresholds of reporting any counterparty with 100 or more total transactions clearing on online GTCs, 100 or more deals on spot GTCs, and 30 or more deals on Firm GTCs.  While some of these obviously don't apply to ENA Upstream now (online deals), others do.  Do you want to keep the same thresholds or lower yours?  I can create a separate spreadsheet for Gerald to review if you want to have separate, and lower, deal counts.  Please let me know.  I'm getting ready to send out the August report (this is usually done the first week of the month following production).

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Stacey,

I think that is a good idea. I have attached a list of the counterparties that reflect those suppliers that are our highest priority because of the number of transactions as well as other provisions that are negotiated each month. Please let me know if there is anything else that you may need from me.

Thanks,

Judy, we currently run a monthly report that we give to Legal showing all counterparties with excess GTCs (both telephonic and online).  We also include credit information and comments regarding the status of any masters we may already have in place with the CP (if applicable).  Since Legal uses this as a tool to see where we really need to focus our negotiating efforts, would you like the report changed to include the ENA Upstream GTCs?  We can then include Gerald Nemec (and any other Legal folks you'd like to add) on the distribution.

Please let me know what you think.  If you'd like the ENA Upstream GTCs included, I will need to work with our IT guy to have the report format changed.  I'll also be happy to send you the August report once I'm done (hopefully today) so that you can see what I'm talking about.

Thanks!

"RE: EEX Confirm","Judy, the confirm language looks good, but the price is wrong - should be Index less .0175 for the first 1700/d and  Gas Daily flat for gas over that amount each month. We can put a MDQ if you want to...but the only way we would have more gas is if they add another well and we could reject it I think if we wanted to based on it not being w/in the dedication......Do you want to talk more about that? Thanks.

Gerald,

Please review the attached completed confirmation for EEX E&P and forward to Ellen Wallumrod to send to the customer if you approve.  We need to get this to the customer today if at all possible.

Per Jill Zivley, there is not an MDQ, but she will work with the customer on a monthly basis for volumes above 1700.  Please let me know if we need to adjust the confirm based on that information.

Note that there is no MDQ.  From the printout, it looked as though all volumes in excess of 1700 MMBtu per day were priced as gas daily.  If there is an MDQ, we will need to insert it.  Thanks.

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Also, PGT needs to make a manual adjustment to the releases - therefore they need the deals loaded and ready to go before the 1:00 CST deadline. We don't want to wait till the last minute in case there are other ""fixes"" that need to be done.

"United Way Days of Caring - EWS","ole0.bmp

<http://www.unitedway.org/local.cfm?id=46377&zip=77002>

EWS has been asked to sponsor the Center for the Retarded, for this year's Days of Caring.  We need your help to make this effort a success.  

What are the Days of Caring?

United Way Days of Caring began in 1992 with 800 volunteers from area corporations.  The Days of Caring for the year 2000 grew to over 7,000 participants from the Houston area.  During the annual Days of Caring, volunteers put their caring into action by working at agency locations.  Donors are able to see for themselves the work done by the agencies, meet those who are served and learn more about how their investment in the United Way impacts our community.

What agency are we sponsoring?

The Center - Serving Persons with Mental Retardation   

 Serving Bay Area and Fort Bend, Harris, Montgomery and Waller Counties  
 Provides opportunities for persons with mental retardation to maximize their potential for independence.   
 Services include: adult activity centers, education, community living options, employment and health services.   
 For more information, visit the website at: www.cri-usa.org <http://www.cri-usa.org> 

How long will I be away from the office? 

You have 2 shifts to choose from.  We will provide your transportation to and from the location.  The morning shift will start at 8:15 a.m., Friday August 10th, with a kick-off from the Office of the Chair.  The bus will then leave at 8:30 a.m. and will drop you in front of The Center.    The bus will return you to Enron by 11:30 a.m. where you can grab your complimentary sack lunch from Chick-Fil-a.  

The Body Shop has been generous enough to let us use its shower facility for anyone who chooses an outdoor activity.

What will I need to do?

You have the option to sign up for a variety of activities.  These activities include Landscaping, Heavy Cleaning, Light Construction, Painting, Arts & Crafts, Playing Bingo, and Hosting a Party (providing baked goods, punch, and snacks).

Will I need to bring any equipment / supplies?

Depending on the activity you choose, you may be asked to provide equipment / supplies.  The necessity for supplies may range from construction paper and scissors to rakes, brooms, and gloves.  Your Business Unit representative will follow-up with more details.

Contest Information -

For everyone in EWS who participates in the Days of Caring, your name will be entered into a drawing  to win 1 of 5 American Express Gift Certificates. 

As I stated earlier, WE NEED YOU TO MAKE THIS EVENT A SUCCESS. 

      

How do I volunteer?

"The U.S. Department of the Interior Minerals Management Service Guaranty","Veroinca,

Below is some additional information regarding our conversation yesterday on MMS. There are 3 deals in Sitara that capture the deal that Nelson has done that begins November and runs through March (Deal #1103008, 1103884, 1103914). We are working with Gerald Nemec to establish a GISB to cover this deal. We are going to use the same form that was used by Enron North America. 

Please let me know if there is anything else that you need from me.

Subject:	Gas Sale Paperwork

Nelson, your current GISB is dated 1/1/2001 and is between Enron North
America Corp. and MMS.

When we scored the 2000 financials we used Enron Corp. financial statements.
We can certainly use other Enron subsidiary's financials if you want to
provide them but, if Enron North America Upstream Company LLC is the
purchaser and the only financial statements we have are Enron Corp. we would
like the parental guarantee to be from Enron Corp.


Enclosed is a guarantee that is available on our web page. You can provide
your own if that is more convenient. At a minimum, the guarantee should
cover 60 days volume at current prices and the term should go from the first
delivery date under the contract until  60 days beyond the last delivery
date. In some cases, we have had companies increase the term and value of
the guarantee so that adjustments don't have to be made for subsequent
purchases.

I know that this is additional paperwork. We are trying to streamline things
as much as we can. But, one of the things we have to deal with is making
sure we are consistent with all our purchasers. We appreciate your continued
interest in the MMS RIK program. Let me know if you have any questions. My
phone is 303-275-7224. Sorry for the long winded message. Hope you have a
good weekend.

"Revision to Master Netting Forms","
As a point in clarification, in Section 2(a) of the Master Netting Agreement the parenthetical ""(including automatic termination, if applicable)"" should be deleted.  Here are the new forms with the deletion made in them.  Since the form is amending the underlyings to not include automatic termination, the parenthetical should no longer be included.

    

Further, see the attached once again revised process (hopefully this will be the last revision for a time!).  Changes are in bold and deal with the gas receivables financing and credit sign-off.  To the extent a counterparty will agree to a 25th of the month effective date, do so, as it fits our physical gas billing cycle and makes it easier to pull out the receivable from the gas receivable financing.

"RE: Dudes...","Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, ""Where is this relationship headed?""  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  

Gerald

You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35"" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20"" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

He is new to Enron and will be helping with our ""Producer Focus"" efforts.

Gerald, a couple of comments...
1) Pricing does not change until 1/102, nor do other provisions like the keep whole, The way you have the contracts drafted, it is as if we have new terms beginning now. I think the producers will object to this and think we are trying to put something over on them now. Can we make the new contracts effective 1/1/02?

2) Under Art. 2 Contract price....I have a questions about the 80% of ""First of the Month Nomination""...what about the 5% swing they get...Shouldn't it be 80% of actuals, subject to the keep whole? Maybe I am the one confused, but could you please call me to discuss. Thanks.

Steve, this was forwarded to me by Robert Rose.  Should we change the name to LRCI, Inc. and go with it?
We'll still need a legal description of the R/W itself.

Patrick,

While reviewing the proposed easement I found myself
making many changes to the easement.  It then occurred
to me that Ann Elizabeth has already prepared a standard
easement for situation where another company wishes
to construct a new pipeline across HPL owned property.

Perhaps you can use this standard easement agreement
(attached hereto) for the situation in Assumption Parish?

Let me know your thoughts on this agreement.  It's terms
and conditions are certainly more favorable to Enron's interests.

"Enron Blood Drive","Due to the overwhelming response from Enron employees and contractors, today's blood drive appointments are completely full, and there are a large number of you who still wish to donate blood.  We are working diligently with the M. D. Anderson Blood Bank to schedule another day for blood donations, and you will be notified as soon as that date is secured.  For those of you who are interested in giving, please continue to either call the Enron Health Center, ext. 3-6100, to get your name on the waiting list or go to the donation line in front of the building.  We recognize and are grateful to the many of you who are wanting to give blood today, but ask that you be patient and understand our inability to accept walk-in donations at this time.  

Thanks again for the tremendous outpouring of concern.

"Enron Principal Investments - Organizational Memo","
Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

Please join me in supporting the efforts of Enron Principal Investments.

Hi Jason and Veronica,

I have left messages with both of you regarding negotiations with Tenaska Marketing Ventures.  Basically, they sent us language limiting any recourse that ENA Upstream might have against the personal assets of any partner, officer, director, employee, or stockholder of Tenaska.  We need to determine whether the company is secure enough for us to agree to this provision.  This is the only thing preventing us from signing this agreement and they are anxious to get it executed.  Please let me know as soon as is reasonably feasible.

Thanks,

Alisha

Judy,

I am sorry to be a pest, but may I ask you about the 5% special pending language for: 
Q-West Energy 1065012
Cohort Energy 1068138

What should I use here? Is this the keep whole language proposed for Mariner and Forest?


Also,
One other question,   Swift Energy 1049657 (oct 01),  This shows a customer PF trigger price of $2.12 is the $2.12 the net price or is the net price  $2.12 less  .155 =  1.965

Thanks so much, I hope you had a relaxing time off.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"Tennessee Gas","Gerald:

I just spoke with Shane Lakho again regarding the Tennessee Gas TPA.  She said that it may have been your predecessor, Sandy Brayband(?), who was involved in this deal, but that the terms had been approved by ENA-Legal for ENA and ENA-Upstream.  Can you confirm this and let me know?  Thanks.

This deal was done some time ago.   I assume that all ENA Upstream deal makers going forward know they should be going through you.

Gerald,

Can you or anyone else who will be working on ENA Upstream contracts let me know if you get any future requests for confirmations or contracts that are for ENA Upstream? All of the purchase deals from the Originations or Mid-marketers for ENA Upstream going forward should be on the Committed Reserves confirmations and that usually does not get communicated so it can be put on the appropriate confirm/contract.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Folks,

Good work on the documents that you've pulled together to get to Nicor and to Shell Capital.  I have added the Letter of Interest along with slightly modified versions of the others attached.  Review, make any minor changes, and let's get these out to Shell Capital (Risks & Mitigants, Schedule) and Nicor (Letter of Interest, Letter of Intent, and Schedule) today.  I would have Gerald take a look at the Letter of Interest prior to sending it to make sure that I didn't mis-represent anything.  Sorry about the hold up on my end from being on the road.

    
Thanks,
Chris Hilgert

Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a ""Discussion Document"" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell

I am still waiting to get a finalized version of the Point Specific GTC from Gerald.  I will copy that in the copy drive once it is finalized and approved by legal.  Gerald, can you please let me know the status on that???

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Please note that the pooling point version is the revised version provided by Gerald.

One more question:  I assume the new keep whole GTCs are primary term.  There is no mention in either the Confirm or the GTC language.  Can you please confirm?   Again, I need something to default to in the template I am setting up.

Gerald,

On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions, the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery.  I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template.  Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts.

I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on.  Are we close to having a final version?  Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

Please get back to me as soon as possible (I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now).  Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

Gerald,
FYI - The paragraph on Firm Transportation Backhaul was revised, to include secondary rights and tiered pricing, and the Interruptible Transportation Forwardhaul was deleted.  Exhibit II was revised and Exhibit III was deleted as well.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

The time frame for WFEC to file a motion for reconsideration of Order No. PSC-2499-FOF-EU with the FPSC expires on Monday, January 7, 2002 (15 days from the date of the order is Saturday, January 5, 2002, therefore the time for filing is extended until the next business day).  If a motion for reconsideration is filed, we have 7 days in which to serve a response.  The time period for
pursuing an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court is tolled until the FPSC disposes of any motion for reconsideration.  If no motion for reconsideration is filed, then the time frame for filing a notice of appeal to the Florida Supreme Court expires Tuesday, January 22, 2002 (30 days from the date of the order is Sunday, January 20, 2002, and Monday, January 21,

"READ:  RE CONVERSION OF 1 WAY PAYMENTS TO TWO WAY PAYMENTS","As you are aware a ""safety net"" type of provision has been included in the master netting agreement to attempt to convert any underlying master agreement one way payment provision to a two way payment provision.  However, this is only a safety net and should not be relied upon.  It may not cover every particular definitional/form structure in an underlying master agreement.  Please be sure to review the underlying master.  It is probably always best to draft a contract specific amendment to convert to 2way payment since this is a critical issue to effect properly the closeout netting and setoff provisions of the master netting agreement.  The specific amendment can be included in the master netting or accomplished as a separate amendment to the underlying master agreement.

Any questions, call me.

"","Gerald,

I just finished visiting with Mark Knippa about Enron Compression Services.  It probably makes sense to get together with you and someone on the bankruptcy team to talk about how we should handle all of the deals in ECS.  Can we set something up for Wednesday?  I have asked Mark to put together deal structure charts and explanations so that we have something to present to the bankruptcy lawyers for consideration at this meeting.  I would ask that you work with him to verify the accuracy of those charts/explanations.

"Napoleonville land sale","Lisa,
Here is the deal as it stands with each counterparty:

Texas Brine
Wayne Sneed--Treasurer, the main contact, his number is 713-877-2661
Ted Grabowski--President and CEO, 713-877-2716
Sale Agreement--The ""Cash Sale Form"" is drafted, no changes needed, Gerald can get executable copies ready right away
Easements Agreement--We would like to delay execution if possible, but Gerald can have executables in place fairly quickly if they insist
DASH--written, requires signatures, beginning with Dave Gorte.

I will call Wayne in the morning and tell him to remain on standy. We'll know fairly quickly where we are when Reliant calls us tomorrow morning around 10:30, and I can tell him before my flight leaves.   If the Reliant deal is off, we can start moving right away on this.  I'll tell him to be in touch with you regarding document delivery and cash transfer.  

Reliant
Ken Bradley--VP Energy Wholesale Group, main contact, his office number is 713-207-1456.  He tends to be easier to reach on his cell, 713-805-3889.
Sale Agreement--The ""Act of Sale"" is drafted and just needs to have the new pricing put in, at which point we can get executables and signature.
Board Resolution--Drafted and submitted to Reliant, we expect they will not have issues with it and we can get executables on what we have.
Corporate Guaranty--Has been executed for $3MM.  Gerald has the original.  For ease of execution we will try to get Reliant to accept it at $3MM even with a higher sale price, but if pressed we will have to get another one signed for the amount of the sale.  I believe Clement Abrams will take care of that, but check with Gerald.
Certificate of Non-Foreign Status--Signed by Stephen Douglas, I have left you the original (for Reliant, I assume) and 2 copies (for us)
DASH--written, but will require ran update for new pricing.  Need to show Gorte one last time, get his signature, and then it needs the rest of the signatures.

Ken will be calling us back around 10:30 tomorrow immediately after his meeting with whomever can authorize a higher price, he has all our numbers so if he can't reach me he will call Jean directly in Buffalo.  If we get a suitable price ($3.25 MM or higher), then the next step is to get them comfortable with the guaranty we have executed, then get the DASH signed and move on from there.  In my previous email, I told him you would be involved, so I'll put him in touch with you as soon as we have a deal. 

The wiring instructions for either party are as follows:

Account name: 		ECT Cash Services Acc. Entity
Bank Name:     		Citibank New York
Account Number : 	40781075
Routing Number :	021000089

Reliant already has these instructions.  Either party may want to cut a check instead, it just becomes a question of which is faster and easier.

I will forward you the latest copies of all the documents for each party as separate emails.  As far as signatures are concerned, Julie Gomez told me she would be in on Wednesday and availabe to sign, but Jean may want to handle it via fax.  That can be decided tomorrow.  I will list out the rest of the needed signatures in the respective emails. 

Well, try as I may, I'm sure there are issues I have not covered, so feel free to call me at any point at the phone numbers I sent earlier.  Good luck and THANKS for helping us out!

Hi Gerald,

I hope that things have gone well with your first set
of law clerks.  I was writing to confirm that I will
be starting work for you next Monday, July 2.  I have
been trying to contact the HR representative that I
spoke with initially, but she hasn't returned my
calls.  I just wanted to make sure that everything was
set for me to begin working.

I also wanted to let you know that I heard from the
HBA about the photograph you recommended me for.  I
wanted to thank you for remembering me.  I think that
will be a great opportunity for me.

If you need to contact me, my phone number is
713-523-4723
or my mobile is 281-814-9934.

Sincerely,

Alisha Mahabir

As for Fred Lagrasta, I've already created a document (copy attached) asking for Lagrasta to be named a V.P.  I don't know where it is in the signing cues of the relevant officers, but it may need to be changed since the directors have changed since I created the doc.

"RE: GT's email?","Thanks for the address.  I emailed Paul shortly after he emailed us, and it
seemed to get through.  But I haven't sent anything lately.  Gotta keep that

Hey E,  Good to hear from you again.  Not much new around here.  Working
and partying.  Still trying to restock the girlfriend pipeline.  George's
email is gtownsend@manorisd.net.  I haven't played any golf recently, but
do like to play.  I am pretty horrible, but it is fun nonetheless.  I would
definetly be up for a round some time. Let me know.

Have you been able to email Bieraugel at the last address he sent?  I have
tried, but my emails keep getting bounced back to me.

      Hey G,

      Haven't heard from you, what's going on?  Things are same 'ol here
   at work, am going on vacation to San Antonio next week.  Hey, I'm going
   to
   be in Austin tomorrow for work and am planning to play golf in the
   afternoon.  I plan to play at a course that is towards Houston on 290,
   and
   since George works out there somewhere, I thought he might be able to
   join
   in.  Do you have his email and/or phone numbers (work/home)?

      Have you been playing any golf?  We got a new analyst here at work
   from UT and he's got got fever.  He got me to play last Friday (my first
   time in Houston!) and now I've got the fever again.  My wife is not
   thrilled, but.................  So if you play at all, we should hook
   up.

      Thanks,
      E

      Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a
   little
      early, so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a
   good
      time on Friday night?  How is everything going?

      It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights
   last
      week to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of
   the new
      car with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points
   on
      Friday and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

      Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of
   him
      since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.

           Gerald,

           Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
   $129
      rate.
           Below
           you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
      matters
           which
           one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
      They're both
           on
           my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

           I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
   from
      SA.  I
           estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
      right?)
           We'll
           actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
   family
      from the
           Valley will be there as well.

           If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
   at
      the
           hotel
           sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
   wedding
      together
           from
           there.

           In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
   got
      him a
           gift
           yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

I'd definitely do my best to get a pass for a game, if you ever have an opening.
Don't want to get my hopes up with the pre-season rankings, but it would be cool
to see a #1 vs #2 matchup OU weekend.

Have you heard from George?  I never got a response from the email I sent him a

I think your on solid ground.  I think the stock will stay down for a
little while until they name those that will join Lay in the office of the
chairman.  We continue to beat earnings estimates, but things like
broadband, Dahbol,  and now Skilling put pressure on the stock.

Not much new going on.  Just hanging out.  Working.  Will be heading to
Austin for the game on Sept 1.  Let's see if the horns can live up to all
the hype.  I have a pair of season tix for all the home games, so I will
let you know when I have an extra for the game.  See if you can't get a
hall pass from your better half.

      I probably should have picked your brain first, but I bought some

   little
   carried away now.  While there is uncertainty over Skilling leaving, I
   think
   your guys fundamental position is still excellent.  Can't say I bought
   enough to help turn it around, but I hope there are others who feel as I
   do.....................

      Anything new going on?  Pretty much the same ol here.  Just about to

   wedding
      together
           from
           there.

"RE: NNG Hubbard","
	Gerald,
	Generally there has been a gas sales agreement with ENA.  Given that this transaction was done as ENA, it may have been handled
	differently.  What contractual provisions exist for the gas delivered by NNG to ENA?

Subject:	NNG Hubbard

Stuart,  I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements:

All these contracts are in Enron North America Corp.'s name

1.  Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one.  We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings.  NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement)  This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities.  No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  Thus it is not terminated.  If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year.  Term is through January 31, 2018.

2.  First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997.  NNG operates the electric driver for ENA.  Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater.  Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above.  Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period).  

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

3.  Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997.  ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative.  Term is through December 31, 2017.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

4.  Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995.  ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation. This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69.

	Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default.  GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default.  If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the ""Stipulated Loss Value"" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder.  The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement.

Let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements.

Are you Ready2Go ?

Have you ever experienced problems accessing the network remotely when traveling on business or when trying to work from home on your laptop?  Would you like someone to test and customize the dial-up access on your laptop before you head out of town on your next trip? 

We have identified a need and are now supplying a new service for Corp and EBS employee's and it's called Ready2Go !

This new service has been established to test, modify, and update the dial-up software on your laptop.

How it works:

A calendar has been created on ITCentral at <http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/Ready2Go>

Go to the site and schedule a time that is convenient for you. Then, bring your laptop to our testing site, (either at 3AC105 or EB2249B).  We will examine your system, update your software (if needed) and even customize it for the next location you will be traveling to.  We'll also provide a brief training session in accessing the network remotely with your laptop.

If you are interested in participating, simply access the web site and schedule an appointment.

Thank you for your time.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

The list furnished to Gerald Nemec are bonds that are open bonds.

 

Since Houston Pipeline Company was sold and they have appointed Marsh USA the agent of record effective 06-01-01.  These bonds should be moved to the new agent and the surety, St. Paul Fire and Marine.  Please let me know how to proceed.

Gerald, we recently placed a $50,000 bond for HPL for Franchise Tax Certification for you.  

I understand from our broker, John L. Wortham that our surety, St. Paul/Seaboard Fire & Marine was informed that Marsh USA will be handling the HPL bonds effective 06-01-01 (please see attached email).

I am attaching a list of outstanding bonds that HPL has in place.   Should these bonds be canceled? Or if these bonds are still required, you may wish to consider placing with your new agent of record, Marsh USA.  They can either be replaced all at once or just prior to expiration. 

Please note while most of the bonds were placed with St. Paul/Seaboard Fire & Marine there are a couple that were placed with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.   

Please let me know how you wish to handle the outstanding bonds.. Thanks.  

If you have questions, please give me a call 713 853-5687.

Mary, we have received information from Roger Bumgarner at St. Paul/Seaboard that Marsh USA has been appointed agent of record effective June 1, 2001 on the HPL bonds he writes.

As you know, there are three bonds with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and two through Insurance Company of North America.  I presume we will  be receiving notice that Marsh has been appointed on them, also.   However, we have not yet received information to that effect.

"RE: Still here and still ready...","Hey Geraldo,

It would be great to see Paul go far in his Navy career, the military can use
more guys of his caliber.........

I had not seen the writings on the bombs, that's great, I'm sure those guys are
motivated to do their jobs well............

Wow, that's great news about Sharon.  This is her first, right?

My sister is now engaged.  She and her fiance moved into an apartment off of
Memorial Drive.  He's an engineer (UT grad as well, civil engineering I think)
and works for Chicago Bridge & Iron.  So we are relieved she hooked up with a
good guy.  She's 27 going on 18, so yes, it's kind of wierd to see your little
sister growing up before your eyes.

We definitely need to get you out to the house.  We just had laminate wood and
tile flooring put in to part of the house, so it's a bit more presentable now.
The cheapo original carpet was getting pretty trashed.  My kids are getting big
fast, they're a lot of work but getting to be a lot of fun too.  All the talk
arouond the house is of Hallloween, they're looking forward to it.

OK bud, gotta get a presentation ready for a meeting this a.m.

Let's hook up soon,

Ernie,  I think that's right.  It makes sense since he is Chief Weapons
Officer.  Bieraugel is one smart dude.  He helped me through many an
engineering class.  Wouldn't be surprised to see Admiral Bieraugel one day.

Did you see on CNN how the Navy guys are writing ""For NYPD"" and ""FDNY"" on
the bombs being dropped in Afghan!  Eat that!!

Yep, Saturday was pretty depressing.  I have to hand it to OU.  Stoops is
an outstanding coach.  I will still go to the games, though some of the
luster is lost. How is the family doing?  My little sister Sharon had a
little boy yesterday.  William Boone.  Pretty weird when your little sister
starts having babies.  We still need to get together when we get a chance.
Let me know when you get some time.

   Gerald,

   Does LCDR mean Lieutenant Commander?  On my last email his title was LT,
   just
   lieutenant.  I guess that means our boy has been promoted......

   The Horns weren't too impressive on Sat.............I was going to go to

"Bridgeline ROFR","Gerald,

I found out that the provision that everyone keeps calling a ROFR is actually a shotgun bidding process.  I am interested in reading the relevant provisions of the document relating to this.  Apparently, if either party wants to sell, it must give purchase price to the other partner and then that other partner has the option to either buy or sell its interest at that price.  This provision may be unenforceable under bankruptcy law if the partner is a debtor.  Please have your assistant provide me with a copy of the partnership agreement ASAP.  Thanks very much.

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

FYI - Karen cannot find an accrued liability balance at 6/30/01 after all.  I want to make sure that this is a final adjustment, not subject to further audit whereby we would have to give it back. Exposure is the 100k we deducted from the Hanover realted amouints.

OK folks, here's an update on Holcomb Oil and Gas Inc./Key Gas Holding, LLC.  The only active contract we have in place with Holcomb is an Enfolio II Spot and the interest assignment letter sent by Holcomb does not cover an agreement so broad.  I spoke with Susan Herrera at Holcomb [(505) 326-0550] and asked her to send an assignment letter.  She didn't seem to really understand what I needed to I also gave her Gerald's number in Legal.

Once we receive a good assignment, I will request that the Global Counterparty group set up the CP.  Sharon will process the assignment at that point.  Depending on whether we want to split deal 901255 or repath will depend on how long this process takes.  I will keep everyone informed in the meantime.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kelli,

I'm not sure who normally submits request to the Global Counterparty group when you have new counterparties, but here is a link to the Lotus Notes request form.  You should be able to be see all the pertinent information needed by the GCP group besides contact name and address.  If you can supply this information, I'd be happy to submit the request for you.  Otherwise, please let me know if you find someone to finish this.  I don't have access to change the counterparty on the deal, so my group will not be able to attach a contract until the counterparty is there.

I spoke with Eric yesterday and he said that you did a great sales job and he wants to try to work with Enron.  He is marketing his gas through John Bower of Natural Gas Associates.  No one here is too impressed with NGA and have visited with them before on behalf of other clients but will meet with John this afternoon to discuss Black Diamond's needs.  From Eric it sounds like they want gas purchases in addition to other physical services.  If that is the case we will bring Mark Whitt's group in on the deal.  I will keep you informed as to the progress.  Mike Legler will likely be taking the lead of this after today.  Thanks for your efforts!  James

"RE: Construction Expedition Letter","Gerald,

Attached are my edits to the letter. Daphne will prepare a version that is
without all of the deletions and additions so it is easier to read. You can
compare the two to see exactly what I have done.

My edits are in blue. Comments are in bold blue and bracketed.

ECS may be over the barrel here and this may be the best deal that you can
get. But it isn't a deal because it is all illusory.

They agree to try to complete construction by a date certain (no recourse if
they don't) in exchange for an ECS guarantee to reimburse Gulf for an amount
that they think is fair (that is the only standard - they have no
responsibility justify and we have no ability to verify that amount).

In general, Gulf is allowed contributions in aid of construction and can
stop construction if they don't get it. If our existing agreements clearly
provide for a guaranteed term and minimum load, and those provisions are
linked to the costs of construction (so no further contribution from ECS was
contemplated in those agreements), then I think that ECS can hold them to
the deal.

We have no contract with WFEC so if the PSC decides in their favor we may
have to petition the PSC and ask that we not be financially damaged by their
decision and Gulf's incorrect representation (upon which we relied) that our
facility was in a territory that they could serve. I think (but have not
researched the point) that ECS would have standing as a customer. I believe
that the commissioners and their non lawyer staff would be sympathetic to
our situation.

However, if we agree to a capped amount of reimbursement then their may be
no issue for the PSC to decide. As of now Gulf has changed the deal on ECS.
If ECS accepts the change (unless under protest) then a court or the
commission will probably consider the matter moot. I'm not sure about the
legal effect of ""signing under protest"" in this context but can do some
research if you think that useful.

In any event I think that the letter should recite more of the history of
this negotiation and the early agreements or representations that are now
modified. I know our clients hate lawyers but we should try to have as clean
a record as possible if we think that we may have to seek relief. I don't
have any of the agreements at issue here and there is probably more that
should be included in the letter to give the context in which it is written
and signed.

More later. Call when you can.

Bill

Attached is my draft of the ""two-pager"" for LLC.  Obviously it is going to be a bit longer than two pages.

Please take a look and provide any comments that you might have.

Also:

1)  Gerald please provide summaries of the debtor contracts as you did for NNG and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo;
2)  Karen - please continue your efforts (in cooperation with Mark) to provide the revenues/expenses both actual and forecasted to be attached to the memo;
3)  Mark - please provide the deal structure diagrams for the deals (obviously you already gave me Gallup - but please forward to me electronically) and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo.

I really would like to have this memo completed by mid-day tomorrow so that I can get it to Patty M as promised.  Thanks in advance for your efforts.

Regards

Stuart

"RE: Renegotiation Letters","Debra,
We are only showing that 4 producers need renegotiation letters:  Kennedy and MTG (notice by Nov. 1) and Quantum and Coleman (notice by October 1).  These are based off of the ""Initial Pricing"" term which was 2 years from ""In service date"" (Dec. 1, 1999).

I show Wellstar and Phillips (Petrogulf) are expiring in Dec. 02 and Independent expires Dec. 03.

Also, I noticed you set up the Phillips agreement as Petrogulf. Do you have the assignments from Petrogulf to Phillips?  I can fax those to you if you need them.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
Theresa

Rude-Dog, Enron is still treating me like a baby treats a diaper!  Just
kidding.  Things are going fairly well and have gotten pretty busy
within the last couple of weeks.  Still trying to recharge the
girlfriend pipeline on the weekends.  Kinda of in a dry spell right now.
Oh well at least my life isn't complicated.  Glad to hear things are
going well for you.  Yes the days of surfing Longhorn boards for 3 to 4
hours a day are over.

I am really getting comfortable with our DTs actually.  Maurice Gordon,
even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc. He crushed Curry in
the endzone for the safety.  Sounds likes Tubbs is picking up the double
teams (ala Casey Hampton) which allows Gordon more room to work.  He is
very quick and can get to the backfield quickly.

Mark my words, Derrick Johnson is our best linebacker Now!!!  Watching
him against NC was a joy.  He toys with the lineman and makes them look
silly when he jukes and blows past them.    The guy needs to be starting
now.  I know he has only played two games, but I haven't seen a more
talented linebacker play at UT since I began watching Longhorn football.

The game against UH is national on ESPN2, I believe.  You should be able
to catch it.  Watch #11 on Defense.  Look for me in the stands.  I be
the one wearing burnt orange.

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Maureen,

I think that Janel Guerrero and Gerald Nemec might be getting into Myrtle Beach,SC around that time.  I have cc'd them on this email so you guys can start a dialogue about getting to Ocean Isle, NC in one car.

Good Morning Brucie! I have a quick question, do you know if anyone is arriving in Myrtle Beach on Friday around 4:30? If anyone arrives around that time, maybe we can share a ride somehow. Vicki and Dennis are flying into Charleston the night before and offered to pick me up on the way but I don't want to incovienice them if I don't have to. Have a good day, Maureen

"Dudes...","Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.

"LOI Outline - Nicor Compression Deal","
Gerald - 
This afternoon, the Compression team is headed to Chicago for a Friday meeting with Nicor.  We have not yet progressed to the point of providing Nicor a LOI.  Instead, one of the items they plan to discuss is the attached outline of the LOI in order to give Nicor an indication of what would be included if and when the deal progresses.  

Could you review the attached LOI Outline and provide any comments?

 

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

"RE: Legal initials for TPA's","Bob,
Thanks for the note-I know we can all appreciate the need to speed up the process, but typically, initialling standard agreements is not where the slow down comes-Legal was not aware that the  standard agreements were being treated any differently than those more negotiated. Legal had authorized Donna Greif's group to originate and send out the standard agreement, but Legal's one check of those was to be through the initialing process--I know Shane was aware of this and has made every effort to comply--perhaps you and Barbara should discuss whether the process should be changed going forward, but until that time, all TPA's and their amendments should continue to come to us before execution. 


Thanks very much--
Sandi




	Bob M Hall/ENRON@enronXgate 06/14/2001 11:22 AM 	   To: Sandi M Braband/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna Greif/ENRON@EnronXgate, Shahnaz Lakho/ENRON@enronXgate, Robert Superty/ENRON@enronXgate  cc: Barbara N Gray/ENRON@enronXgate, Gerald Nemec/ENRON@enronXgate  Subject: RE: Legal initials for TPA's	


Let me clear up this process.

Suzanne is only looking at the TPA's that are standand/model agreements which had been
pre-approved by legal.

If there are any changes to the model that has been approved, then legal will have to sign-off.

If this is unacceptable, please let me know.

We were only trying to help speed up the process.

Suzanne was not initialing as legal, but as operations rep that there were no deviations
from the model agreement.

Hope this helps.

Donna and Shane,
As I mentioned to you previously, Gerald Nemec will be handling the trading partner agreements upon my departure. His extension is  33512. As has been the practice in the past, Gerald should initial all trading partner agreements and any amendments prior to execution by a VP. I understand that Suzanne Calcagno has initialed some of these agreements without authorization from legal and while I understand she has recently received her law degree and awaits bar results, since she is not part of our legal department we would ask that you continue to abide by the procedures we have set in place to come through our legal department  until such time as Barbara Gray authorizes a different procedure. If you have any questions about that please feel free to contact Barbara Gray at ext. 36832.

Thanks and it has been a pleasure working with you!

"Re: Dudes...","You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35"" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20"" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Subject:  Dudes...

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

"RE: Greeley Gas Company","I need to check on their 3rd party debt.  I'll get back to you later today.

However, since the entity is set up as a division of Atmos Energy Corp, do we legally have a master contract with Atmos Energy Corp as well??  Greeley's exposure rolls up under Atmos Energy at the end of the day and they transact under both names.  Also, have we verified that Greeley Gas Company, a division of Atmos Energy Corp is actually a valid legal entity??

Let me know, please.

Thanks--Veronica

Attached is the Guaranty that has been review by our legal department with
the changes that they requested.

Trevor  I also ran across a few contracts in  the name of Bridgeline Gas
Distribution. There hasn't been any activity on these contracts over the
past year. Should we take Bridgeline Gas Distribution off of the approve
bidders list? If not we will need it listed on the guaranty as well.

Thanks

 4.5. Termination Offset.  Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date, the Notifying Party may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Affected Party by the Notifying Party or any Affiliate of the Notifying Party under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by the Affected Party to the Notifying Party or any of the Notifying Party's Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of the Affected Party and the Notifying Party under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by the Notifying Party and/or the Notifying Party's Affiliates.  The Notifying Party will give the Affected Party notice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section 4.5, ""Owed"" shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.  Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section 4.5 may be converted by the Notifying Party into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which the Notifying Party, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, the Notifying Party may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section 4.5 shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law.  This setoff provision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, off-set, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represent and acknowledge that the rights set forth in this Section 4.5 are an integral part of the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  The parties further acknowledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Section 4.5, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section 4.5 and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had entered into this Agreement as its relates to Section 4.5.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Notifying Party shall not be required to pay to the Affected Party any amount under Section 4.5 until the Notifying Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever of the Affected Party to make any payments to the Notifying Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied.

Would you please prepare a memo regarding PB-KBB and the work that they are doing.  The memo should include scope of work, amount currently owed, amount to be spend from now until completion and the substance of the conversation that took place today.  I am not looking for a novel but rather something that is concise and can be taken to Don and the cash committee for approval.  I will take what you put together and add some information regarding the importance of getting approval for this contract given our need to complete Cavern #1 in order to satisfy our obligations under the Bridgeline agreements.

"ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes","
INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom
Large Agricultural Processing

Gentlemen:

Please find the attached letter agreement, structure term sheet and key assumptions for the Kathleen Anne storage field.  I would suggest the following:

1.	All parties review and comment on the language of the documents.  

2.	All parties should assess the assumptions provided with respecto to their requirements and economics.

3.	Enron will forward the historical values for the summer/winter spreads.  Note: the average value (2006 $s) of the expected summer/winter spreads going forward is assumed to be $0.38.  This spread is based on Enron's price curves, and the base economic value of the deal assumes we capture the full summer/winter spread in each year.  

4.	All parties develop assumptions/requirements for the following:
	a)	GLO and PNP required % of net oil revenue (net of costs) during EOR period, and storage period
	b)	GLO and PNP required % of net storage revenue
	c)	Enron base marketing fee (as well as cost estimate)
	d)	Enron at risk marketing payment


5.	 We meet to discuss:
	a)	Transaction structure, roles and responsibilities
	b)	Key project assumptions
	c)	Actions going forward

Regards,
Brian

Hi Mary, 
I don't have a clue who filed the original documents.  I know for a 
fact that ROW did not do the filing for this transaction.  It seems 
to me it would have been someone on EB38 who did the filing. 
Back a couple of months ago there were copies of some of the 
agreements in a meeting AE, Patrick Johnson, and I had (I 
think AE brought her copies to the meeting).  So, it would 
stand to reason that these copies should exist in AE's 
""Enron"" files left on EB38.  I don't think I ever saw the 
originals though.

Dear Robert:  Do you recall what you did with the documents relating to
Bridgeline whereby the Napoleonville land was kept out of the
transaction by being deeded over to LRCI, Inc.?  Patrick Johnson recalls
you were involved with those documents, and we're trying to find them.
Ann Elizabeth White said that she believes the files are here in Legal,
but we can't locate them.  Patrick Johnson's recollection that you might
have filed the conveyance documents is what leads me to ask you if you
have them or know where they are.  
Thanks for letting me pick your brain on (yet again) another document
search.

 Dear Debra,

I want you to know that I am truly sorry for not meeting you for lunch. I
feel so bad. I am in Dallas right now visiting family. I was interviewing
for jobs in Atlanta last weekend. Anyway, I will be back in town on Thursday
of this week. Friday lunch would work great for me, just let me know. I want
you to fill me in on how you have been.

Subject:	RE: Enron/Hanover

Mark,

The agreements you received are to cover the operating lease with the purchase option quoted for this transaction. Hanover will issue the contract whereby Hanover Compression Limited Partnership will be reflected as the Lessor and ECS will be the Lessee. Hanover will then assign the contract to GE whereby all monthly payments will be remitted to GE. Hanover will enter into a separate agreement to cover the maintenance and service portion of this transaction, of which Hanover shall invoice.

The documents forwarded to you are the actual documents you'll be require to execute however they will reflect Hanover as Lessor. Additionally, Hanover maintains all warranty obligations extended against the package regardless of the assignment to GE.

Please review the documents and advise of any exceptions or issues. Keep in mind that these documents are specifically for the monthly operating lease installments and that most of the language is required to comply with the FASB Accounting regs. which keep this transaction as an operating lease/off balance sheet transaction. This is a standard agreement we utilize with other companies seeking operating leases with purchase options while maintaining an off balance sheet transaction.

I'd be glad to visit with you or anyone from your office if necessary to clarify any questions or concerns.



>>> ""Knippa, Mark"" <Mark.Knippa@ENRON.com> 06/22/01 03:52PM >>>

Not sure I get the picture.  ECS is expecting to have an Operating Lease with Hanover that accommodates the new compressor station (equipment, packaging & installation).  ECS is also expecting to enter into a Maintenance Services Agreement with Hanover that covers the provided equipment and installation, bumper to bumper, for the 10 year term of the agreement.

What has been provided is blank documentation from GE Capital that requires maintenance services, delivery, use & operation, insurance, the return of equipment, etc. that does not fit the parameters of our discussions with Hanover.  Is ECS
expected to execute the agreements with GE Capital or with Hanover?  Is the Hanover Agreement expected to mirror this agreement 	less the services that Hanover is being hired to perform?

	?

I have sent a copy of the T4 permit revision that was sent to the RRCT in May of this year for the HPL Compression Company facility--Permit #05561.  As I noted on the cover letter, AEP must submit a new P5 which identifies their organizational information in order for Kathy Arnold to process the T4 permit for this facility.

FYI - I called Mary Ogden today to follow-up on the status of the Napoleonville Land sale document filing (sale to TX Brine).  Mary said that she is still trying to locate the document(s).  She plans to finalize in one of two ways:  
1.  Our lawyers in Louisiana are going to send someone this week to check the Assumption Parish records (to see what was actually recorded);
2.  Mary sent an e-mail to a former Enron Landman (now AEP), Robert Rose.  Ann Elizabeth told Mary that Robert may have a copy of the document(s).

Mary,

Would you call AEW and find out where we can find a copy of the Tract 5B sale from Enron Storage Company to LRCI, Inc. here in our office--I know you are planning to call Sandi Braband; according to the message below, AEW must have done the work.

Also, would you please call Keith Daigle (I don't want to use Locke Lidell on this) and ask him to obtain a file stamped copy of ""all"" ESC conveyances to LRCI that are filed in the Assumption Parish Records.  Keith's phone number is 504-830-3990 or 985-898-1909.

Would you also ask Keith how he is coming on the Sorrento Right of Way Agreement that I sent him on July 7.  We need to have that back by the time Patrick Johnson returns next Monday.  Please give him a ""gentle"" prod. 

Thanks,

Steve

Steve - I have a few comments and inquiries, as follows:

An update on Tract 5B sale to TX Brine:
Paul Bieniawski spoke to Ann Elizabeth this afternoon and she told him that the law firm, Locklidell (sp.), dropped the ball and failed to file the appropriate papers with the authorities.  The papers should have been filed by now.  How can we confirm the filing? Do you have contacts at Locklidell (sp.)? Can we call the authorities? 

Proposed sale of Tracts 5A, 4B & 4A:
Since LRCI now owns the land as a result of the merger, does Enron have the authority to sale the property and thus keep 100% of any sales proceeds?

Also, I meant to mention to you earlier that I am working on another deal (Keystone/Unocal) which incorporates both compression and storage; Northern Natural Gas is involved as well and we need your help in generating a term sheet.  I will call you tomorrow to discuss further.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

Lisa,

This is the matrix I got from Judy Thorne on which GTCs to use.  Can you please double-check it and see if anything has changed?

Based on this, one-day deals will fall under a GTC Spot if we don't have a GISB in place with the producer.  In that instance, we don't need special handling in Sitara.

Hope this helps.  Please let me know what you find out from Gerald.

Thanks,

Gerald,

When you get a second, see if the following accurately captures which confirmation template should be used with which deals.

Confirmation Usage		
		
Form	Deal Type	
GTC Firm Pooled Gas	1 - 12 months Pooled Gas	
GTC Firm Point Gas	1 - 5 months Wellhead Gas	
Committed Reserves	Producer trades > 6 months	
GISB	Day-month trades not with Producers with GISB	
GTC Spot	Day-month trades not with Producers without GISB	

Thanks,
Judy

"Enron Industrial Natural Gas Company","To:  Ms. Cheryl Dudley, Houston Pipe Line Company

Dear Cheryl:  I'm sending you this information to follow-up regarding our brief discussion today about the subject company.  As I mentioned, the Texas Railroad Commission still shows this company as active.  We have written to the TxRRC before saying that all the facilites and contracts for Enron Industrial Natural Gas Company were sold to HPL, but they can't ""de-activate"" the company yet because their records show it as ""active"" due to the acitvity shown by another company.  

Apparently the company that needs to file corrected P-4s showing that HPL or another company is involved in these leases is:

Devon SFS Operating, Inc.
20 N. Broadway, Suite 1500
Oklahoma City, OK  73102
Phone:  405-235-3611

The wells operated by Devon that show up in the TxRRC records are:

Gas ID 147583, Well #3, State Lease # 90621
Gas ID 147993, Well #4L, State Lease #90621
Gas ID 147996, Well #4U, State Lease #90621

I hope this information is helpful.  Thanks for helping us resolve this issue with the Texas RRC.

Best wishes,

"ENA Gas Structuring","
In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

I just spoke with Tina Horn from the Cameron Parish.  They received the letter voiding the original agreement.  She said that since using it for potable water was the only use they had in mind, they won't be needing the ROA to the pipeline.  (Actually, she told me that their engineer had told them that it would be possible to clean the pipeline to the point that it could be used for potable water.)

In light of this, could you please look into the procedures for abandoning the pipeline according to Louisiana law?

I assume this language would completely replace the Variance langauge that we currently insert in our GTCs and any Replacement Price Differential Language in our Pooling Point and Wellhead GTCs.  I.e. this will be the only measure of damages for these deals.  If this is not correct, let's discuss. 

Ellen,  This language would be the same language use for the W&T Offshore and Spinaker deals.  Is this correct Nelson?

Please review before sending out to make sure I have correctly captured your business deal.

1) Scope of Agreement: ..""judgement resulting from this Agreement shall be made only from the revenues received from Customer's natural gas system operations..""  I need to re-review the financials to determine how much the gas system operations is worth.  Because of this clause, $15mm in credit may be too much.  Once I can get on the net, I'll review.
 
2) Scope of Agreement:  ""Furthermore, in accordance with the Colorado Springs City Charter, performance of Customer's obligations.....expressly subject to appropriation of funds for such purpose by the City Council.""  In case we are in a position to call for margin, what is the process of getting it?  Do they have to get permission / authorization from the city, etc..? Tyrell had asked me the process how we call and what we accept for margin, but I'd like to understand the ease and/or difficulty of receiving margin from them.  We may never hit the threshold, but if we do and we can't get margin, we may have a big problem.

Counterparty:Illinois Power 
	        500 S.27th
	        Decataur, Ill 62521
	        Attn: Steve Warren

Deal info: IP is the Utility relative to our proposed NICOR transaction
Facility: Nicor Storage Facility at Troy Grove, Ill

Note: IP is owned by Dynegy, however, I understand that IP is bound by ""affiliate rules"" with regards to Dynegy. How comfortable are you with this? Do you think we need additional language in the CA to protect us?


With regards to the Devon CA the following are the Devon comments;
 

You should add at the beginning of paragraph 3, the following:  ""Each party represents that in providing Confidential Information to the other, it has the right and authority to do so.""
Whenever we look at a CA, we should endeavor to limit it in time and coverage.  You say that the agreement concerns purchase of electricity in the Carthage area, but in the opening paragraph, the CA states that it is related to ""a proposed sale and/or purchase of natural gas or fuel.""
You should get this clarified to say something more definitive.  For example, more definitive language would be something like ""...in connection with a proposed sale and/or purchase of electricity in the Carthage Field area for purpose of providing power to compression facilities.""
Other than that, the CA looks good.  Thanks.
  
>>> Blaine Wofford 07/25/01 07:52AM >>>
Jim, do you mind taking a quick look at this document. It's relative to the purchase of electricity for the Carthage area.

"BCCKOP Operating Agreement","Gerald,

Here is a revised copy of the agreement.  I added some strong safety
language in Section 22 which I need you to look at.  Also, I don't see a
""Failure to Perform"" provision - is this covered somewhere else?

Also want to discuss the Remedy in case of Default provisions.  I don't want
BCCKOP to be able to shut the facility down and hold us hostage for payment
of something.  I want them to be able to terminate the agreement, and then
orderly shutdown the facility and then leave.  Otherwise, we keep on
operating.  Let's discuss.  Also added words on Schedule F.

David/Richard:

I hope you had a good time on the hunt and made it home in time for the service.  We'll try to do another hunt behind dogs later in the season.  To follow up on our discussions with PNP, I have proposed a Letter Agreement which defines one basic structure for the deal.  This is definitely open to discussion and I would like your input.

When Richard visits tomorrow, I would like to review the pro forma we have developed for the transaction.  The pro forma is a work in process - but provides a good start on understanding the total project value as well as the return to each party.  If we can agree the basic structure of the deal, we then need to agree the commercial assumptions and how the revenue stream from the sale of oil and gas is to be provided.

After you have had a chance to review, I will arrange a visit to take any comments.

Regards,
Brian

As far as I know, Sandi Braband was not able to prepare the confirmation for the Dale Resources outsourcing deal to send to ATS.  Whom in the legal department should I work with to prepare that confirmation so that we can get our finders fee?

Sandi,

I am told that you were the person responsible for drafting the confirmations for the Producer One finder's fee and that you will no longer be performing this function. I am trying to find out who in legal will be responsible for drafting these in the future.  As far as my records show, we have sent a confirmation to Alcorn, and we still need to prepare a confirmation for the Dale Resources deal.

Do you have the records that identify what deals that have been confirmed for Finder's fees?  Do you know who will be taking over this function?

I appreciate any help that you can provide.

Thanks,

"New Course Offerings","Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

"Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Electronic Data Interchange Trading Partner Agreement","Gerald,

I have been asked to review the referenced Agreement for EES Legal.  I have been informed by Shane Lakho that you participated in negotiations with Tennessee Gas, that you had signed off on the terms in Paragraphs 7 and 9 of Exhibit A, and that Tennessee Gas was not willing to engage in further negotiation.  

My instructions had been to compare the agreements to an EES-approved standard form, and to initial them if theywere substantially in compliance with the standard.  The Tennessee Gas Agreement deletes Enron's warranty disclaimer, so I pointed this out to Jim Keller.  He said to contact you and if you had no problem with it, that I should go ahead and initial the document.  Could you please advise as to whether I was correctly informed regarding your approval of the terms in the Agreement?  Thanks.

"Crawfish Plant Filing","Dear Patrick:  Yesterday I spoke with the Office of Conservation at the Louisiana Dept. of Natural Resources about the Crawfish Plant.  As you may recall from our phone conversation several weeks ago, we (LRCI, Inc.) have been assessed with a civil penalty for failure to file an R6 report in July.  La. faxed me a copy of the June report, and it shows a balance of 29 barrels of oil at the plant.  We can't close out the filings with the state until the R6 report shows a balance of zero barrels.  

I've spoken with Annette Thompson in accounting, the specialist who signed the June, 2001 R6 report, and she said she's in the process of determining exactly how to report the disposition of those last 29 barrels of oil.  In the meantime, I've prepared a payment request form to go through the ipayit system for a check in the amount of $250.00, the civil penalty.  This can accompany our final filing when it's ready.  

When the check comes back for coding, should I sent it along to you for approval under your work order (WBS element) number?  Please tell me what that is so I can input the information.

Many thanks.  I'll call you when the check and final R6 form (from Annette Thompson), and the change of filing status form for the Crawfish Plant are ready.

Best wishes,
Mary

Shawyne Smith has made the following deals with Unimark LLC   pooled and committed wells ( 1063501, 1033968, and 1063576 ) which include pricing language with 5 separate tiers for maximum volumes of 4275/d.
How should we confirm these deals?  We have language to confirm 2 pricing tiers.  

Judy how should we proceed to confirm these deals?  Should we start this trend of multiple pricing tiers for such small volumes?

Please let me know how we should proceed.

Thanks for the feedback.  Attached is the latest version of the Term Sheet (changes are in BLUE) for your review.  

Chris and Ned are meeting with Unocal early this afternoon.

Subject:	RE: Unocal Term Sheet

I have reviewed the term sheet and I am fine with the form.  

I did spot a potential issue with the Transport piece of the proposal.  If ENA holds transport on NNG, it cannot simply sell use of that capacity to Unocal.  The shipper of record with NNG needs to hold title to the gas that is being transported.  For Unocal to utilize this capacity, they would need to either directly contract with NNG for such capacity, or ENA would acquire the capacity then ""Capacity Release"" the capacity to Unocal.  The Capacity Release would be subject to NNG bulletin board posting requirements.    Let me know if you want to discuss further.

Gerald, 
Per our conversation yesterday, attached is the Unocal Term Sheet for your review and comment.  This is a non-binding proposal.  Note that the items in red are either questionable items or rates/prices that need to be confirmed and/or filled in.  
 << File: Unocal Keystone Term Sheet (Sep-06).doc >>  

The compression guys are meeting with Unocal tomorrow (Friday) early afternoon to discuss the project and term sheet.

Please advise.

"FW: Hola mi primo!","e-mail from mattie....

Labor Day weekend . . .
I'm up for whatever you, Jenn, Jeff, Clarke . . . and Gerald, of course . .
.  want to do.  I'll go to bars, parks, concerts, rodeos, restaurants,
beaches, museums and/or just stay at your house.  Whatever.  I can't imagine
that anything you guys want to do would be something that I would be against
doing.  And, if it is then I'll just have something to give you shite about
for the rest of your life.

The Flight:
Northwest Airlines flight #0198 from Minneapolis . . . arrives Thurs Aug 30
@ 4:15 p.m.
Northwest Airlines flight #1277 departs Houston Mon Sept 3 @ 1:05 p.m.

I believe it is a Northwest flight -- not a Continental connection.  The
website and my e-ticket say nothing about Continental.

Again, if providing a ride from/to the airport at those times presents a
problem because of traffic and/or your jobs I don't mind taking a cab --
just let me know.  If no one is around on Friday because you're at work
that's no big deal either -- you don't need to make special arrangements for
me.

Continental Cozumel 2002 vacation pricing is supposed to available on the
web beginning Wednesday I think.  FYI.

I'll be leaving here early today as the Bud Tent awaits me at the Fair.  Oh,
my -- I'm thirsty & hungry.

   You'll like.  It is fun once you get past some of the boring basics.  I
   have been playing about 2 years.  I don't practice as much as I should,
   however if I turn my amp up loud enough, the noise will cover all my
   mistakes.  What type of music do you want to play?  Let me guess, Heavy
   Metal!

      Nothing real exciting.  After Thursday, I was a little burnt so I
   stayed
      home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends house.  He
   plays
      the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session (or at
      least
      we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday I went
      furniture shopping and purchased a couch for my house.  I got kinda
   of
      sick
      of have no furniture in my living room. Now my house won't seem so
      pathetic
      when people visit.

      Yea, I have been to Teala's.  Can't say I have ever had the mango
      margarita
      though.  I will have to try when I get a chance.  Sounds fruity!!

"FW: Gulf Rate Docket - Weather Derivatives","Gerald,

Subject: Gulf Rate Docket - Weather Derivatives




MR,

With information about Harry's testimony in Georgia and about the existing
Gulf revenue sharing program, I've changed my opinion about whether Enron
should intervene in the Gulf docket.  Enron may benefit from intervening in
the Gulf rate docket both by selling the Florida Commission on its weather
derivatives and by dissuading the Commission from raising the retail rates
charged to ECS/EES.

The Commission's order in the territorial dispute is due December 3.  To
avoid any adverse inferences in that docket as a result of intervening in
the Gulf rate docket, we should not file the intervention until after that
time.

There is a preliminary issue identification meeting in the Gulf rate docket
on Nov. 7, but this may be moved because a meeting in the RTO docket has
just been scheduled for the same time. We will attend both meetings.

Enron likely has standing to intervene in this docket.  Both the Florida
Cable Telecommunications Association and the Florida Industrial Power Users
Group (which has no significant member in Gulf's territory) have been
granted standing to intervene on the simple grounds that they are retail
customers of Gulf and electricity represents one of their largest variable
costs.  Gulf has not objected to the petitions of any persons seeking
standing.  The Federal Executive Agencies also have standing to represent
four military bases in Gulf's territory.

The existing and soon expiring revenue sharing mechanism makes this docket
ripe for pitching weather derivatives.  If we petition (after Dec. 3) and
are granted standing to intervene, it will be necessary to prepare and file
Harry's direct testimony and exhibits by December 21. The schedule of
remaining activities in the Docket is:

  issue statements due:  Jan. 2
  second issue identification meeting:  Jan. 14
  Prehearing statements:  Jan. 24
  Prehearing conference:  Feb. 8
  Hearing:  Feb. 25 - Mar. 1
  Briefs:  March 15

Natalie spoke to the Rates and Tariffs Division at the PSC about the usage
characteristics of the military bases.  As we discussed, I was curious about
whether they were also designated PX (Large High Load Factor Power Service).
Because a customer's designation is Gulf's proprietary (and very guarded)
information, one cannot know for sure whether the military bases have the
same designation as ECS.  However, Dave Wheeler, asst. director of rates,
said the military bases are probably designated LP (large power service) and
not PX.  PX designation applies for customers whose demand is 7.5 MW (7,500
kw), with an annual load factor of at least 75%, at any one meter.  The
military bases take delivery at multiple delivery points and probably have
different rates at the different delivery points.  They likely do not take
more than 7.5 MW at any one point.

The LP or LPT (large power time sensitive) designation is more likely
because that applies to customers with a demand of 500 kw, which the
military bases probably have at various delivery points. Still, it is very
likely that the rate increase, as proposed, does not affect the federal
executive agencies.

Dave Wheeler also guaranteed that Gulf's current rate proposal (that leaves
the PX rate unchanged) will not be approved by the Commission.  He said that
they will not permit a rate increase that affects only small customers. Bad
politics.

The level of effort required for this intervention will be greater than the
RTO Docket. There we had only to endorse positions asserted by others.
Although here we will merely be endorsing Gulf's rate methodology, we will
also be introducing the weather derivatives concept as relevant to Gulf's
rates. Gulf may be so excited by the potential of weather derivatives that
they carry the burden by themselves. However, we can't count on that until
we are sure that they understand and can sell the product to the Commission
and staff. Therefore, the Enron budget for this intervention will have to
assume that Enron carries the burden. We will be expected to advocate and
participate fully.

Based on these assumptions I think it likely that the KKH fee expense for
full participation in this Docket will be about twice that in the RTO
matter. In the RTO Docket we billed Enron $27,204 through October (after
writing-off $4,207 at your request). Therefore, a planning number for this
Docket (no guarantee that it will be limited to this amount) is $50,000.

Let me know what you decide.

Bill

"Sale of Napoleonville Land","Louise,

Tomorrow, I am flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving with my father.  As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:

Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM.
Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the ""Act of Sale"" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental).

I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding ""war"" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.

Regards, Mrha

Subject: The History of Aggie Civilization - THIS IS GOOD!!


THE HISTORY OF AGGIE CIVILIZATION

The history of the aggie people is as confusing and complex as any culture
that exists on earth. Yet, unlike many peoples that have adapted and
evolved in response to external and internal influences over the centuries,
the aggies have largely remained true to their roots. And they're proud of
it. As a result of passing on their beliefs and practices over the years,
their behavior over time has been remarkably consistent. It is this
consistency that makes them an exciting and fascinating group to study.

Who are the aggies? The relationship between the aggies and morons, idiots,
and okies are often misunderstood. Contrary to widespread belief, the
aggies are considered, and consider themselves, a separate people from the
morons, idiots, and okies. Historically, the true stupidity of aggies has
largely dominated over, and outnumbered all three other groups combined.
The misconception that the four groups are related probably stems from the
fact that morons and idiots have imitated many rituals and behaviors
practiced by the aggies. However, aggies are a distinct group. [Although
recent evidence (Solomon, Shyster, et. al?1995) suggests that at one time,
probably early in the century, aggies and okies lived together and
interbred in parts of Southern Oklahoma and Texas, hence, Arkansas was
populated by their offspring.

What largely separates aggies from the others groups is their social
interaction. Unlike okies, idiots, and morons, aggies are highly social
creatures that tend to validate each other's views and beliefs. This can
lead to what scholars call a ""groupthink delusion."" It is believed that
these delusions are the glue that have bound aggies everywhere together
over the years.

The history of the aggie school of thought actually begins in ancient
Greece, with the early philospher Slocumedes, who was the first to
recognize that the absence of everything is equivalent to nothing. He had a
large number of stupid followers and much of his works is still passed on
from parent to child today. Stupicles, from Pheces, taught that all things
could be crushed by a large enough piece of wood. His students, known as
woodpeckers, practiced pet embalming, hand gestures, organized grunting and
mastered many techniques in consuming solid food through their nasal
cavities. Stupicles was also a prolific writer. Unfortunately, his twelve
volumes of philosophical works, which he wrote entirely in the sand on an
Egyptian beach, was lost during a high Mediterranean tide.

With the rise of the Roman Empire, many aggies sought the stability and
steady work afforded by slavery. The aggies however, made poor slaves, and
many were forced into Christianity for ""entertainment of monks"" and so that
they could be fed to the lions. Others were driven out of the Roman Empire
into Northern Europe where they settled many colonies. The void left by the
fall of the Roman Empire provided the aggies an opportunity to flourish
unhindered in Europe, hence Poland and France were populated.

The aggies didn't fare so well during the industrial revolution since the
philosophical and scientific frameworks of Descartes and Newton didn't give
much leeway to superstition and planned ignorance. More and more aggies
found themselves falling into the ranks of the working masses. Aggies
caused many early industrial accidents as they tried to fit into this
rapidly changing society, and evidence of their engineering prowess
remains, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Their ways and practices were
not appreciated in the new European culture; however, and increasingly many
aggies sought refuge across the ocean in America. That is those who didn't
wind up sinking their ships in the North Atlantic.

Part of the problem in identifying an aggie is that they look and act much
like anyone else until they do or say something decidedly stupid. Most
aggies don't think of themselves as morons, but rather as intelligent
individuals. This makes it very difficult to reason with an aggie. Stupid
acts can take many forms and vary in degree, but when an aggie commits one
it is unmistakable. The majority of the times a aggie turns out to be
nothing more than an inconvenience and source of humor to the innocent
bystander. These incidents are played out on city streets, supermarkets and
country Dairy Queens daily. However, there are times when these acts can
get out of hand and be devastating. It is always wise to be on alert and
prepared, and stay away from large stacks of logs, maroon-clad men wielding
binoculars, or people with shaved heads with swords.

At times you may find yourself in close proximity to an aggie in the midst
of a stupid spell. It is good advice not to approach them during an
incident unless accompanied by a trained professional. If you find that you
have no choice, then speak slowly and use small, soothing words. Never try
to outwit an aggie since they will only interpret that as a hostile and
aggressive act. Always let the aggie think they are superior. And under no
circumstances let your face or hands, pets or livestock near aggies mouth.

Keep in mind at all times, that although an aggie may seem intelligent and
civilized, they are not. It is an adaptive disguise developed over the
centuries.

Beware, be safe, and be orange!

Hook'em!

"RE: Napoleonville land sale","I have spoken with Robert Tilotta with the Ad Valorum Tax Group, and he said that in general all ad valorum taxes for 2000 have been paid.  He is going to pull the payment information.  I will keep you updated.

Since the total book value for the 354.36 acres of land is 1,434,968.64, then each acre is worth $4,049.47.  The amount for the tract being sold is 1,336,811.04 (330.12 @ $4,049.47)

Ana, 

Per our conversation earlier today:

Our survey shows the tracts we are selling consist of 330.12 acres.  For the purpose of the DASH, we need to have a precise book value for those 330.12 acres, so I need to confirm with you one final time the book value for that land.  

Also, the draft agreement for the land sale stipulates that all ad valorem taxes bearing against the property due and payable through 2000 have been paid.  Before we sign the agreement, we need confirmation from you that this is the case.  

Since we are trying to close this deal tomorrow (11/20), I would appreciate a quick response.  Thanks for your cooperation.

Stacy: 
I hope all is well on the home front.  The more astute among us have spotted the following items in the agreements that should be changed: 
  
NGSA 
            Section 3.4 (ii) - - change ""counterparty contract""  to ""counterparty contact"" 
            Section 9.1 - - change ""...or should have know...""  to ""...or should have known..."" 
            Section 13.1 - - There was also some discussion about the prohibition against issuing ""any... statement with respect to the existence of this Agreement..."" being overly broad.  Because Palo Alto is a public agency, open meeting laws may result in referencing this agreement, although not necessarily disclosing the business terms.  I think this concern would be addressed by adding the language I proposed in the email I sent you yesterday. 
Transaction Agmt. 
            The end date of the ""Delivery Period"" described on page two should be December 31, 2002, rather than June 30, 2004, to coincide with the term of the NGSA. 
It would help matters immensely if we could get a ""final"" version of both agreements from you by noon (Houston time) on Monday.  If there are any problems, please let me know right away.  Thanks.

"New Temp IDs","Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and
	then ""Folder List"")

2.	Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab

4.	Left click on ""Add"".
	Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the ""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click ""OK""

5. 	You should now be back in the ""properties"" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the ""Shift"" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has ""own"" or ""owner""
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on ""Apply"", then ""OK"".

6.	Right click on your ""Calendar"" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

Dear Fellow Diver;

Ok, ok, I know I said I'd do better job of getting these out on time, but now you can stop sending me emails asking when the next newsletter is coming out!  Here's a quick update. We've added about 11,000 new fellow divers to this month's newsletter, which brings us up to about 260,000 PADI Divers worldwide, making this the most widely read newsletter in the industry!

From the entry-level certification numbers we're seeing, you're all doing your part by  bringing many new divers into our great sport.  Please keep up the good work.  However, PADI and the diving industry do need your help in another way.  Recently, an Associated Press article, based on a study by the National Sporting Goods Association, was released saying that US participation in scuba diving fell way off in 2000.  I know it's not true because PADI's numbers were up and we represent the lion's share of the market.  So how can you help?  When you're asked to participate in any market survey,  please take a minute to answer the questions and let them know you are not only a diver, but also a PADI diver. When they ask about activities, name scuba.

About a month ago, the Regional Managers (that's our great team of sales/training people who visit retailers and resorts), for PADI Americas had a great sales meeting on Orcas Island in Washington.  We all worked hard and dived hard while we were there.  We stayed at the Rosario Resort (a really cool place by the way!)(http://www.rosarioresort.com)  and would like to thank Ron Kenny from Island Dive and Water Sport for showing us a great time and some fantastic diving. If you're in the area, or just want to dive with a giant octopus, give Ron a call.  Great customer service and good times are guaranteed. Check out Island Dive and Water Sport at www.divesanjuan.com. Be sure to tell Ron that I told you about his operation. I love it when PADI retail and resort operators call me to say someone mentioned the Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter to them!

I'd also like to thank all of you who took the time to review the consultation document  (http://www.padi.com/news/archive/last/052901_wargraves/ ) online and responded in favor of allowing responsible wreck diving, while respecting our underwater cultural heritage.  PADI on behalf of the diving industry at large is making progress on this subject and will keep you informed.

What are you doing from 26-31 July? Well, if you happen to be in Australia, swing by the Sydney Boat Show and say hello to our team from the PADI Asia Pacific office and visit all of our hard working resort and retail members exhibiting there.  This is the largest boat show in the Southern Hemisphere and this year it has a Dive Expo area. Check it out at www.sydneyboatshow.com.au. and be sure to tell the PADI staff at the show that you read about it in this newsletter.
If you've recently checked the PADI homepage, you may have seen a very historic dive industry news item (http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/todaynews/062701_historique/). On 13 June 2001, PADI and the F?d?ration Fran?aise d'?tudes et de Sports Sous-Marin (FFESSM/French Federation) agreed to work together in developing France's dive industry. The historic accord represents the start of mutual cooperation for the benefit of France's dive industry and divers worldwide.   Jean-Claude Monachon, CEO PADI Europe, summed it up best by saying, ""You can come to France and dive, that's important. Divers from Europe and around the world can come to this country and experience our fabulous diving. That benefits both France and diving.""

A little over a month ago, the youth chamber of commerce (JCE) from Fr?jus / St. Rapha?l, France conducted a beach cleanup that attracted a lot of media attention.  All summer long in the port of St. Rapha?l on the Mediterranean, Project AWARE pamphlets are being passed out to divers and visitors alike.  Good job to everyone involved!
The Protect the Living Reef initiative is a big success with many Project AWARE Patrons (https://www.padimembers.com/Sforms/aware/default.htm) requesting brochures, stickers and lapel pins.  The new manual, A.W.A.R.E. Our World, Our Water (http://www.padi.com/aware/get_involved/LivingReef/news/022601_ourworld_ourwater/) is really taking off as well. If you haven't read it yet, go by your PADI Dive Center or Resort and get your copy today.  And, don't forget the deadline for the Project AWARE Photo Contest (http://www.padi.com/aware/photo_2001/ ) is July 31st.
Now, get your calendar out and circle September 15th. Then, visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort and find out how you can participate in this year's International Clean-Up Day.  It's not too early to begin working with your local dive facility or organizing your own cleanup.  For details on any of the global Project AWARE programs, visit http://www.padi.com/aware/.
I am buying drinks again this year at the PADI Diving Society's Total Submersion event in Grand Cayman 8-15 November (http://www.padi.com/ptn/weeklyspecial/).  I will be there for the first few days, so if you catch me there and tell me you're a Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter reader, I'll buy you a drink (underage readers get soda!) We've already got more people going than last year, so don't delay, book your trip now!  Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort, or contact PADI Travel Network for details.

Last but not least, for you last minute travelers, it's not too late to join Bob Coleman, Director of Marketing and Malene Thompson, Manager of Public Relations for PADI Americas during Cayman Country http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/travelnews/070201_cometocaymancountry/, August 1-5 and 8-12. Country music stars (and PADI divers) Travis Tritt, The Wilkinsons, Rascal Flats (winner of the Country Music Association's Best New Group) and SheDaisy are scheduled to perform, along with favorites the Kinleys and Chris Cagle.  Again, contact your PADI Dive Center or PADI Travel Network to make it happen. If you run into Bob, be sure to tell him you read the Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter. He might just have something for you!

Are you going diving this weekend?  If not, please do me one more favor. Take this newsletter into your local PADI facility and tell them Brian said to stop by and ask what's new?  They will not only appreciate the visit, but while you're there you can begin planning your next dive adventure, check out the latest in dive equipment or move up the diving ladder by signing up for your next PADI course!

Now, get a friend and go diving!

Brian Cronin.

Here you go. Let me know if this looks ok.  In addition to the 20 rows here, there were 10 from Bridgeline and 1 from AEP that I don't think you have access to.  I can check my email while in class (in 3AC) so let me know if you need anything else added to this report.  I will try to get to the other report some time tomorrow.

I basically pulled all active contracts with contract type GISB Base Contract 6.3.1 or GISB Base Contract under all maintenance groups that I have access to.  The list is sorted by maintenance group, counterparty name, and then contract number.  I need only the maintenance group, contract number, contract type, Enron entity, Enron ID, counterparty name, counterparty ID, and effective date for all such contracts where trading method equals WRITTEN only. 
 
Please do not hesitate to call me at home if you need additional information (I will be leaving at 5:00).  You can page me at (713) 710-6084 or call my cell phone (713) 557-9010.  My home number (where I'll be after 6:30 or so) is (713) 953-1775.

If you can supply me with the selection criteria you used to create your spreadsheet and the data fields you want to include, it would be easier for me to generate a new report and save it to  a spreadsheet with exactly what you want.  I will work on this after class this evening.

Hi Sundar, 

I know that Fred is out all this week, so I'm hoping you can help me with an urgent IT request.  I submitted request 3143 today at Legal's request.  I need to provide Legal with information on contracts that need to be amended or terminated immediately.  Is there any way you can run this report for me soon?  I ran an initial query out of Global Contracts but was not able to filter or sort on trading method.  I was at least able to narrow down the list of contracts to run your report from.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

	-In para (2) deleted reference to ""in ____."" Per discussion with William Fleenor if the agreement is not specific to the Longview 	plant, we should have no accounting issues.

	   I'm expecting GE to provide that support but we need to have an interface that I expect
	   to be Hanover.  

	- Hanover may bid to provide the maintenance for the gas compressor as a separate
	  process with the customer. Customer is currently expecting to perform this function 
	  themselves & call in contract resources when necessary.

	- ECS will need to reflect the cost and agreement and description of services to provide
	  us the ""interface"" between GE and Oakhill.

	- ECS will need to contract with GE for the maintenance services and then decide if we
	  want to assign that agreement to Hanover or carry that ourselves.  

	
	 	
	I want to have these agreements set up to be executed prior to executing with Oakhill
	and contingent on the final execution of the CSA and O&M agreements with Oakhill.

	Lets discuss as soon as possible.

	Thanks
	mk

Dave, let's discuss.. Jay, I know that this does not represent the definative agreement but as a starter we would easily do part 1, and part 2 is where the complicated issues lie.

We clearly need to understand the contractual arrangements they have with the third party.... if we go with part 2.  Dave, what are their plans to liquidate their july position? Do they have any hedges on now?  What generation asset are they delaying... ( important info). Get ENA a copy of all purchase and sale agreements including ( executed copies/originals). Make sure that they do not have confidentiality issues related to the confirms... If they do not, then we can look at them... if they do have CA issues then Gerald is advising me that they will need the consent of the seller to let ENA look at agreements.

Subject: RE: Gas Purchase and Sales Contract


I have reviewed the Keep Whole language that was given to me at our meeting
and find the following:
1.	Refer to para. (ii), next to the last sentence. The word ""fail""
needs to be plural.  
2.	Please refer to the second para., 4th sentence. Seller and buyer
need to be reversed. Buyer shall pay Seller.
General Terms And Conditions
1.	Section 1, Transactions - 16th sentence, ""...within ten days of
Seller's receipt..."", not Buyers receipt.
2.	I understand we will eliminate the use of too many terms used to
describe the quantity. I feel the use of Baseload is sufficient.
I would like to see formal agreements (ie: Confirmation and GT&C)
incorporating the items we have discussed, including 1.) the deduction of
actual costs language 2.) Seller is responsible for all cost(s) upstream of
the delivery point and Buyer is responsible for all cost(s) downstream of
delivery point(s). Sellers right, at it's sole option, to cancel agreement
resulting from buyer's inability to move gas which is caused by Buyer's
transport. (IT or FT).
Thanks for your attention and please contact me should I be of assistance.

		Thank you for your time yesterday. Please find Mariner's
legal input and
		my
		review of the Keep Whole language you provided me.

		Mariner Legal Comments and suggestions:

		1.	Incorporate in each confirmation, as the second
sentence of the
		last
		paragraph in the confirmation: ""However, Section 2 of the
GTC shall not
		apply"".

		Keep Whole Language comments:

		1.	At, ii, second to last sentence, the word fail
should be plural.
		2.	The first paragraph after (ii), fourth sentence, the
words
		""Seller
		shall pay to Buyer"" needs to say ""buyer shall pay to
Seller"".
		3.	MMBTU needs to reflect a daily quantity unless ENA
intends it to
		be
		a monthly qty. Lets clarify what the official ""Baseload
Quantity"" will
		be.
		Lets discuss. Will this quantity change before the first of
each month? 

		Thanks for your attention.

"Enron Update","Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

Gorte has already looked at this one, so we should be okay to get going on the signatures right away, though I would still start with him, just in case.  

There must be a computer glitch (!!!), because I am not able to open the Act of Sale and Board Resolution documents that Gerald forwarded.

"RE: Sale of Napoleonville, LA property,  Our file ENR-02","Gerald,

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner on this.  I have sent an email to David Owen about the hazardous waste question.  I will let you know what he says.  However, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think we want to make any warranties about potential hazardous waste sources on the property.  At the most, we could make a warranty about the fact, if true, that we have never used the property in such a manner.  David Owen should be able to tell us a little more about the uses of the property.  

As far as Item #3 below is concerned, do you know if we have done a title search on the property?  If we need to do a title search, there is a guy in Louisiana that can do it for us.  If we know there is a discrepancy in the chain of title, is there a way to nullify the latest transfer between LRPC to LRCI.  

Let me know what you think.  If you think it is necessary to meet to discuss these points, please let me know.  

Thanks,

Gerald:

    I have been contacted by Kim Torres of the Assumption Parish Police
Jury.  She has some questions and concerns about the Purchase & Sale
Agreement, to wit:

1).  They want to add warranty language to ? 4 as follows:

    Seller warrants that it is the record title owner to the property
being sold, and warrants it has good and merchantable title, free of any
and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
buyer for the same.

    Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that
persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding
authority to do so.

I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor
revisions which I will do.

2).  They are concerned about the warranty language which covers
hazardous wastes in ? 4.  They tell me that they have not done an
environmental inspection of the property.  They want to know if there
have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on
the property.  They are looking for something in writing that no such
sources existed.

3).  Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31,
1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to
Louisiana Resources Co., Inc.  Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc.  I

Subject:	FW: Unimark: Faxed comments concerning pymt due date

One other thing I forgot to add:  we've already discussed having templates for those CPs with changed due dates, but we are waiting to see just how many CPs request these change.  Right now it's manageable and I don't want to have a bunch more templates to have to worry about.  It's easy enough to remember to change those new GTCs we set up now, so we'll just play it by ear.  If too many CPs request these changes that it makes it difficult for us to keep track of, then we'll set up new templates accordingly.

Please give me a shout if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Cyndie,

We get these requests from time to time, so it is not all that uncommon.  We are currently taking this on a CP-by-CP basis and not making any assumptions yet.   Gerald has already agreed that while the default payment date on the GTC states the end of the month, we CAN change the due date to the 25th with the CP's agreement.  Southwestern Energy Services is the CP we have changed already.  You might want to coordinate future changes with Lisa, Mary, Sharon/Susan.   And of course, please keep us all in the loop on any new CP's you need to have changed.

Thanks,
SBR

Subject:	Unimark: Faxed comments concerning pymt due date

Per a 11/15/01 fax notice, Unimark wishes the payment dates be ""Payment by wire on the 25th Day"". Referenced deals: 1061122; 1062624; 1063968; 1061089; 1063576; 1146397; 1064010; & 1061084. 

Okay, new kid on the block here:

I'd assume that it is a safe assessment that Unimark would prefer all future payments to be made on the 25th via wire. Lisa, is this something you'd confirm with Unimark (contact per fax is Cheryl Hartsell, phone#: 405-844-6200 ext. 228) or is this something I can do?

Mary, given where we are in the month I know that the payment details have already been established & that given the date that it is too late to process Oct production for payment today.

Stacey/Sharon: Please adjust the payment detail in Global so that the terms flow downstream to Unify for next month's production.

Also; Lisa, Mary, Stacey & Sharon - - - - how common are the requests for payment date adjustments? I'd assume (former life experience) that the larger producers or those who process royalty or related payments require payment on the 25th due to their responsiblities. If this is common - - - instead of repairing after the fact - - - - do we have a list of customers that we should automatically adjust the payment terms within Global & likewise to that of the GTC template?

Gerald - - - - Hi! I'm over here in Confirms now. What is your input on this issue or to that of the common occurrence? Also, as the 'new kid' - - - - are their any future protocols I should know of???


Thanks all!!!!

"RE:","I agree with Chip but question which would be faster.  I think both routes are identical in terms of result but may differ in the amount of time needed to accomplish them.  I believe that we are allowed to enter into new agreements, without court approval, provided that they are in the ordinary course.  My understanding of the process for assuming an existing contract is that it typically requires some oversight/approval by the bankruptcy court/creditors committee and further it may require the debtor to rectify any prior defaults (I am less sure of this one).  Obviously, a bankruptcy lawyer should be consulted.  By carbon copy of this email, I am asking Gerald Nemec to run this to ground with one of the A&K or Weil lawyers.

I spoke with Duane Harris from PB-KBB (Tommy Smith's boss) regarding the Napoleanville work.  I briefed him on how the pre and post bankruptcy invoices will be treated.  They are willing to keep working provided we do the following:

1.	Provide an accounting of what invoices are pre and what invoices are post bankruptcy - so we can get on the same page with them regarding the numbers.

2.	Put in place a new contract between PB-KBB and the Estate to cover post bankruptcy work.  Please work with G. Nemec to develop the form of the contract that we want to propose to the cash committee.

3.	He also wants to have a discussion with regard to the pre-bankruptcy invoices, but he realizes he is an unsecrued creditor with respect to this work.

Lets you, Stuart and I chat by the end of the day to see where you are on this.

Subject:	ENA Upstream issues

Gerald,

On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions, the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery.  I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template.  Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts.

I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on.  Are we close to having a final version?  Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

Please get back to me as soon as possible (I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now).  Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

Robert,

Attached are Harry's calculated volumes for the Napoleonville Storage #1 well.
The 107 degree temperature is the equilibrium temperature of the salt and
was obtained from the temperature log conducted after the drilling of the well.

Garry,
The following information is in response to Mr. Morgan's questions, please
froward to Robert after your review and agreement.
Cavern Volume = 15,116,914 BBLs
Min. W.H. Pressure = 577 psig (based on 0.30 psi/ft gradient @ the casing
shoe)
Max. W.H. Pressure = 1626 psig (based on 0.85 psi/ft gradient @ the casing
shoe)  This pressure will be exceeded at the very end of dewatering to push
the brine back to surface, it is calculated that the pressure to finish
dewatering will be 1631 psig (w/ 65 psig of brine system back pressure).
Pad (Base)Gas = 3.53 BCF @107 deg F
Working Gas = 7.4 BCF @107 deg F
Total Gas = 10.93 BCF @107 deg F
The well diagram can be found in the Permit Application in Section 4.

Thanks,
Harry

Please start the dewatering process on July 30th.  To prepare from my
end, I need some information:

	Large table showing dewatering progress by day
	Curve showing max gas injections vs day

	Cavern parameters
		Spacial Volume in barrels
		Min wellhead pressure (0.30gradient)
		Max wellhead pressure (0.85gradient)
		Pad gas - Bcf at what temperature
		Working Gas - Bcf at what temperature
		Well diagram showing tubulars and dia/depth of hanging
string

I would like these Tuesday pm, so I can share them with others before I
leave for vacation.

Thanks.

Our landlord here in Denver (Equity Office) is requesting a formal notice of ""Enron North America, Corp.""'s name change from ""Enron Capital and Trade Resources"".  Apparently, on our lease, it says ""Enron Capital and Trade Resources"", but in the 3rd Amendment, it reads ""Enron North America, Corp"".  Equity says they need a copy of what was sent in for the official name change.  I'm not sure if you have something we can give them???  Please let me know.

I appreciate your help,

I had an error in the Adjusted Purchase price calc.  Instead of $4,000,705, it should be $4,705,000.  Thus, the adjusted purchase price should be $209,863,642.  The error correction is in ENA's favor.
With that change, NBP is good with the document.

Hi Jason and Veronica,

I have left messages with both of you regarding negotiations with Tenaska Marketing Ventures.  Basically, they sent us language limiting any recourse that ENA Upstream might have against the personal assets of any partner, officer, director, employee, or stockholder of Tenaska.  We need to determine whether the company is secure enough for us to agree to this provision.  This is the only thing preventing us from signing this agreement and they are anxious to get it executed.  Please let me know as soon as is reasonably feasible.

Thanks,

Alisha

"FW: ENA Upstream Reciprocal Keep Whole","Gerald,
 
I spoke with Nelson about developing consistency in the language for all of our contracts. As for the Notice of Variance section, we would like to use ""email, fax, phone or where an agency agreement governs, direct access to Operators"" for all of our Reciprocal Keep Whole confirmations. Please feel free to reword, but our intent is to excuse the Producer if we have executed an agency agreement because we are contractually obligated to get that information.

On second thought, I probably should attach a copy of the document.  Ooops!



Charlie,

Well, upon review, the lawyers wanted me to bounce the following
""Transaction Confirmation"" document off you.  It references your Enfolio
Purchase contract, but give a bit more details than your Conformation sheet.
Let me know what you think as soon as possible.  Thanks,

Dan

Subject:	Malin Retructuring with CNR

 Here are the details of the CNR restructuring that is happening effective Dec 1/01.  This should reduce the amount of credit Enron has been asked to post with both PGT-NW and TCPL.

TAGG ET3738 - 15,000  mmbtu at Malin

ENA releases to CNR PGT capacity Kingsgate to Malin 15,000 mmbtu Dec01-Oct02 at full tolls
EC assigns to CNR TCPL-BC capacity ABC to Kingsgate 16,222 GJ Dec01-Oct02
EC assigns to CNR Nova ABC capacity 437.7 e3m3 Dec01-Oct02

EC purch from CNR of 15,000 mmbtu term Dec 01-Oct08: 
Del Pt changes from NIT to Malin
price changes so EC does not collect Nova, TCPL-BC or PGE-NW toll; EC still pays to CNR 25% of PGE-NW and TCPL-BC tolls
EC does not collect fuel. i.e. Fuel NIT goes to zero

EC sale to ENA of 15,000 mmbtu term Dec 01- Oct 08:
Del Pt changes from Kingsgate to Malin
price changes so ENA does not collect PGE-NW toll
EC does not supply PGE-NW fuel

CNR appoints EC as nomination agent on PGE-NW and TCPL-BC
CNR assigns West Gate shrinkage rights to EC

EC and ENA own renewal rights. CNRL does not.

TAGG E99896 - 10,000  mmbtu at Malin

ENA releases to CNR PGT capacity Kingsgate to Malin 10,000 mmbtu Dec01-Oct03 at full tolls
EC assigns to CNR TCPL-BC capacity ABC to Kingsgate 10,815 GJ Dec01-Oct03
EC does not assign Nova

EC purch from CNR of 10,000 mmbtu term Dec 01-Oct 03: 
Del Pt changes from NIT to Malin
price changes so EC does not collect TCPL-BC or PGE-NW toll; still collect Nova toll
EC does not collect fuel. i.e. Fuel NIT goes to zero

EC sale to ENA of 10,000 mmbtu term Dec 01-Oct 03:
Del Pt changes from Kingsgate to Malin
price changes so ENA does not collect PGE-NW toll
EC does not supply PGE-NW fuel

CNR appoints EC as nomination agent on PGE-NW and TCPL-BC

Howard Sangwine and Greg Johnson are preparing confirmation amendments that should reflect the above terms.

Any questions give me a call.

"FW: from Nanjing","Recent message from China Jonny:


Howdy! We haven't moved yet to Nanjing, I was just there for work purposes.
Will be moving there in late August (probably August 23-25). It's been
rainy/cloudy here in SE China for the last three days, a wonderful respite
from the furnace like heat of the past six weeks. The countryside from
Shanxi all the way down to Jiangsu province was choked with varying shades
of green. Even Shanxi province has received some rain this summer; this
helps mitigate the effects of a three-year drought they've suffered through
recently.

Had a good 4-day weekend in Taiyuan. We had a big dinner party for Ai Ping's

father on his 65th birthday. This party also served as mini-wedding
reception for us and the Shang family's close friends. Both of Ai Ping's
parents are from Henan province. One of Ai Ping's uncles works for her
brother in the steel business. Essentially, he's a good-hearted,
hardworking, farmer from the Shang family's ancestral home village. Northern

Chinese peasants are world famous for their ability to drink gallons of rice

liquor, and I was witness to a fascinating display of this sort. The uncle
must have consumed about a liter of various alcohols including the local
moonshine, a bottle of Jim Beam that I brought, and lots of Qingdao beer.

He was the king of China for an hour; people were rolling on the floor with
his antics. The wait staff of the restaurant even stopped working to observe

him bouncing off the walls in drunken glee. He drank two large whiskey and
cokes within minutes and stated,""It's just like drinking a cool glass of
water!"" to the delight of the revelers. Of course, disaster eventually
struck. He hadn't eaten enough food, and his poor liver couldn't process the

tidal wave of booze. First, his head went bonk onto the table. People ran
for cover expecting the worst. He wretched under the table. Ai Ping's
parents were obviously embarresed, but didn't lose too much face because
everyone was friends or family.

We're hoping to make a trip back to the USA in early October if all goes as
planned. Is this a good time for your guys? China has its National Day
holiday (one week) in the first week of October. We would leave China around

the 29-30th of September and make it a one week trip back to the states. The

Wuxi school is obligated to reimburse me for two, round-trip plane tix. I
need to use them before I lose them. This summer's work schedule didn't
allow me any time off. Let me know if this is a good week for you guys.

Dad, we'll need your assistance in obtaining a tourist visa for Ai Ping. You

and Mom will need to write a ""letter of invitation"" for Ai Ping explaining
the reason for her travels to the US (ie. an Iowan wedding reception). The
person who invites the Chinese national to the US must also do one of two
things according to the US Embassy's website in Beijing: either provide tax
information from the last 2-3 years OR fill out and sign the I-134 form
which guarantees your economic situation. Unfortunately, you're going to be
involved in some more beaurocratic bliss in order for us to get Ai Ping her
travel visa. My sincere apologies. We've begun collecting documents here on
the China side for the same purpose. I'll do some more net research
concerning this issue, and try to provide you with more info. However,
please start preparing these documents if possible. Once Ai Ping is issued a

tourist visa to the states, travels there, and returns she'll have a much
easier time obtaining the next visa in the future because she'll prove to
the INS that she's not an immigration threat. Thank you for your assistance
in these matters.

That's all for now. Will write again in near future with more info. Hope all

clan members are healthy and in good spirits...

Love,

Jon

			Maintenance contract that accommodates all parts, labor, engineering, etc. for all the equipment they
			provided into the project.  These quotes will be provided to ECS and Hanover.

			GE needs the system and design details from Rusk Co. to formalize the package design and pricing
			 
			GE will act as a sub for Hanover who will roll-up the total package of services to ECS.  

			GE will provide a Draft Service & Maintenance Agreement to HCC and ECS.


	Hanover Compression
			HCC will package the skids and provide all the equipment & materials on this skids as well
			as the on-site installation.

			HCC will provide ECS with a detail description of the installation, services and pricing for the project.

			HCC will provide a Maintenance Quote for the compression equipment and materials that HCC provided
			into the project.  (Jim, we probably need a detail description of this so that we can demonstrate how this
			service compliments the OGS resources rather than appearing to be a replacement perception).

			HCC will provide ECS with a project schedule that will become part of the agreement package.

			HCC will provide or perform any torsional studies, equipment testing and start-up resources for the project.
			(Jim, lets discuss to establish an overall schedule that incorporates GE, HCC and Rusk Co.)  My big picture
			look tells me that Rusk Co. will need to begin ordering & sizing transformers next month to ensure a Firm
			in-service date of like 10/01/02.  I want to target a 9/01/02 available for service date and an expectation to have
			electrical service ready and available for Testing and Torsional Analysis work.

			HCC will provide a set of Draft Contracts for the project (Operating Lease & Service and Maintenance Agreements)


	As you guys know, I need everything yesterday.  Obviously all the pricing is critical as well as the Contract language because the 
	agreements with OGS will need to be specific and represent the services that each of you are providing.  Our schedule is critical
	not just for a successful 2nd Quarter close but also to accomplish an 8/02 date for testing and a 9/02 available for service date.  I
	am establishing a FIRM In-Service date of 10/01/02 where all the commodity arrangements will take effect.  I'm expecting that Dave
	Owen and Jimo will be running point with HCC and GE for all the technical and scheduling coordination.  I also need to have the 
	Draft Contracts early next week if not before.  

	Thanks

"RE: Whazzup!","G$-

Whatup Dog?  How is Enron treating you?  Still enjoying the legal side of
things?

Everything here is going well.  Marriage is still very good, even blissful.
Michigan has been great so far but I am still waiting for the weather to
turn.  I am not jazzed about the winters here.

I have been keeping of with the horns (of course) a little from up here.
The UNC game was televised here and I think UofH is on ESPN2, I just don't
know whether it is regional or not.  I agree with you on the analysis.  We
are strong on defense and special teams (surprisingly so on special teams),
but I still worry about our DTs.  Offense is stagnant and I continue to wait
for them to get on the same page.  We have soooooo much potential there.

I haven't been to a Michigan game yet.  We missed Miami Ohio and I don't
think Lyd and I are going to got to the Eastern Michigan game this weekend.
We will certainly be going to the Big 10 games though.

Let me know how things are going when you have a chance.  Ironically, I am
busier now then I think I ever was at Enron.  I feel like I am constantly
behind the curve.

Talk to you soon.

The Horns are looking pretty good.  The defense has really been
spectacular as well as special teams.  The offense is sputtering right
now, but I think they will get back on track.  I am going to the UH game
this weekend.  We had better put a whipping on them. But with Texas you

Gerald:

    I reviewed the enclosed agreement and made several revisions.  I am
enclosing a redlined version showing my revisions for your convenience.
 My major revisions are summarized as follows:

    1.  I changed all references to ""rights of way"" or ""easement"", to
""servitude"" or ""sevitude of right of use"".  Louisiana law does not use
the terms ""easement"" or ""right of way"".

    2.  I rearranged the last three clauses in the 1st paragraph for
clarity.

    3.  I combined the content of the 5th paragraph into the 3d paragraph.

    4.  I change the 6th paragraph slightly to strengthen the rights
retained by Grantor.

    5.  I added language to paragraph 7 to give more detail to the
process of abandonment and to strengthen the rights of the Grantor upon
abandonment.

 Please call with any questions or if you need further help with this.
 Thank you for allowing me to provide professional advice on this matter.

Subject: RE: Gas Purchase and Sales Contract


I have reviewed the Keep Whole language that was given to me at our meeting
and find the following:
1.	Refer to para. (ii), next to the last sentence. The word ""fail""
needs to be plural.  
2.	Please refer to the second para., 4th sentence. Seller and buyer
need to be reversed. Buyer shall pay Seller.
General Terms And Conditions
1.	Section 1, Transactions - 16th sentence, ""...within ten days of
Seller's receipt..."", not Buyers receipt.
2.	I understand we will eliminate the use of too many terms used to
describe the quantity. I feel the use of Baseload is sufficient.
I would like to see formal agreements (ie: Confirmation and GT&C)
incorporating the items we have discussed, including 1.) the deduction of
actual costs language 2.) Seller is responsible for all cost(s) upstream of
the delivery point and Buyer is responsible for all cost(s) downstream of
delivery point(s). Sellers right, at it's sole option, to cancel agreement
resulting from buyer's inability to move gas which is caused by Buyer's
transport. (IT or FT).

		Thank you for your time yesterday. Please find Mariner's
legal input and
		my
		review of the Keep Whole language you provided me.

		Mariner Legal Comments and suggestions:

		1.	Incorporate in each confirmation, as the second
sentence of the
		last
		paragraph in the confirmation: ""However, Section 2 of the
GTC shall not
		apply"".

		Keep Whole Language comments:

		1.	At, ii, second to last sentence, the word fail
should be plural.
		2.	The first paragraph after (ii), fourth sentence, the
words
		""Seller
		shall pay to Buyer"" needs to say ""buyer shall pay to
Seller"".
		3.	MMBTU needs to reflect a daily quantity unless ENA
intends it to
		be
		a monthly qty. Lets clarify what the official ""Baseload
Quantity"" will
		be.
		Lets discuss. Will this quantity change before the first of
each month?

to me it would have been someone on EB38 who did the filing. 
Back a couple of months ago there were copies of some of the 
agreements in a meeting AE, Patrick Johnson, and I had (I 
think AE brought her copies to the meeting).  So, it would 
stand to reason that these copies should exist in AE's 
""Enron"" files left on EB38.  I don't think I ever saw the 
originals though.

Subject:        Closing document re Napoleonville land conveyance 
Dear Robert:  Do you recall what you did with the documents relating to
Bridgeline whereby the Napoleonville land was kept out of the
transaction by being deeded over to LRCI, Inc.?  Patrick Johnson recalls
you were involved with those documents, and we're trying to find them.
Ann Elizabeth White said that she believes the files are here in Legal,
but we can't locate them.  Patrick Johnson's recollection that you might
have filed the conveyance documents is what leads me to ask you if you
have them or know where they are.  
Thanks for letting me pick your brain on (yet again) another document
search.
Best wishes,
Mary

"RE: Cargill Guaranty","Gerald!

I took a look at the proposed changes and also spoke with my counterpart at Cargill, we are fine with the changes.  Please execute a guaranty in the amount of $8MM. 

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Nemec, Gerald  
Sent:	Wednesday, October  24, 2001 4:03 PM
To:	Johnson, Rudwell
Subject:	Cargill Guaranty

Rudwell,  Attached is a redline of the guaranty with my comments.  Specifically they are:

	1.  I am OK with including reasonable attorney fees, but they must be included in the $2.5 million dollar cap.  
	2.  The use of subtantially in Paragraph 2 seems redundant.  The notice requires reasonable detail.  To add subtantial compliance on top of that is redundant.
	
I am OK with the other changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

"Update on Kristi and Greg","
Hi everybody,
 
Well, somethings didn't turn out as quite as  planned.  In case you didn't hear, our first offer on our house fell  through.  Fortunately, we already have another offer and the new closing  date is November 26.  All indications are that this one will go through so  here's the timeline...  We're leaving Houston on December 3.  We'll be  in our new house in Florida sometime between Dec 7 - 15th.  That gives us  just enough time to get settled in before the new semester starts on  January 7.
 
We've set up a hotmail account so we don't miss any  emails until our new Florida DSL account is ready to go.  You can start  using it immediately: scubadoobydoo_FL@hotmail.com     (Our panacea account will be valid through the end of  November.)  You can always use our website to get the active email  address.  Go to www.scubadoobydoo.com  and click on  ""Contact Us"".
 
We'll give everybody our change of address info as  soon as both home sales are officially done.  
 
Have a great Thanksgiving!
Kristi and Greg  Foster

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"RE: PSA Doc.","Gerald,

The contact information for Assumption Parish is as follows:

Assumption Parish Police Jury
Attn: Kim Torres
P.O. Box 524
Napoleonville, LA 70390

I have two changes that you may have already taken note of.  The first change is in the description of the property on the first page.  In the 8th line in the description, it says ""the South property line a distance or 260.02...""  it should read ""distance of 260.02"".  This change also needs to be made in the description contained within Exhibit B.  In the description contained within Exhibit B, there should not be a period after the words ""to the point of beginning"" in the 10th line.  

The second change is also in Exhibit B on page 2.   In the paragraph that starts ""all parties signing the written instrument...."", I don't think ""marital status"" should be in there.   

One final thing, the purchase price for the warehouse and land is $100,000.  

Give me a call if you have any questions.  Also, let me know if you need any help with the lawn-mowing agreement.

Sex in Florida
A couple, both  age 78, went to a sex therapist's office. The doctor asked,
""What can I do  for you?""
The man said, ""Will you watch us have sexual intercourse?"" The  doctor looked
puzzled, but agreed.
When the couple finished, the  doctor said, ""There's nothing wrong with the
way you have intercourse,"" and  charged them $50.  This happened several
weeks in a row. The couple  would make an appointment, have intercourse with
no problems, pay the doctor,  then leave.
Finally the doctor asked, ""Just exactly what are you trying  to find out?""
The old man said, ""We're not trying to find out anything.  She's married and
we can't go to her house. I'm married and we can't go to my  house. The
Holiday Inn charges $90. The Hilton charges $108. We do it here  for $50, and
I get $43 back from  Medicare.""

"Napoleonville land sale","
Gary,

Per our conversation on July 11, I would like to reiterate that an Enron entity is interested in selling approximately 330 acres of land at the Napoleonville salt dome in Louisiana.  This land is divided into two tracts, one of about 256 acres and the other about 73 acres in size.

Enron recently received $15,000 per acre in a separate land transaction at Napoleonville, and this sets the market price that we expect to receive in the above proposed land sale.  

Does Dow have interest in this land?  Is this price within your range?  If so, I would encourage you to draft a proposal from Dow within the next two weeks, if possible.  

This email does not constitute an offer, but is solely provided for informational purposes.  

Let's discuss this at your earliest convenience.  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last Thursday, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!  

Sincerely, 
Eva Rainer

Would you please prepare a memo regarding PB-KBB and the work that they are doing.

"Lay It On the Line Survey Results","Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Ellen,

Based on some additional information from Linder regarding their Pre-pay deal, the confirmations for the August confirmations as well as any confirmations that we prepare through the end of the Pre-payment deal that runs through October will need to be GTC Firm confirmations with modified MDQ language.  Please get with Gerald Nemec if you have questions regarding how to prepare the MDQ language. 

Also, please prepare these confirmations as soon as possible. The pre-pay paperwork must go out to the customer by August 10th; and Stacy Dickson needs the confirmations in order to complete the pre-pay contract.

Thanks,
Judy

Cyndie,

We get these requests from time to time, so it is not all that uncommon.  We are currently taking this on a CP-by-CP basis and not making any assumptions yet.   Gerald has already agreed that while the default payment date on the GTC states the end of the month, we CAN change the due date to the 25th with the CP's agreement.  Southwestern Energy Services is the CP we have changed already.  You might want to coordinate future changes with Lisa, Mary, Sharon/Susan.   And of course, please keep us all in the loop on any new CP's you need to have changed.

Thanks,
SBR

Subject:	Unimark: Faxed comments concerning pymt due date

Per a 11/15/01 fax notice, Unimark wishes the payment dates be ""Payment by wire on the 25th Day"". Referenced deals: 1061122; 1062624; 1063968; 1061089; 1063576; 1146397; 1064010; & 1061084. 

Okay, new kid on the block here:

I'd assume that it is a safe assessment that Unimark would prefer all future payments to be made on the 25th via wire. Lisa, is this something you'd confirm with Unimark (contact per fax is Cheryl Hartsell, phone#: 405-844-6200 ext. 228) or is this something I can do?

Mary, given where we are in the month I know that the payment details have already been established & that given the date that it is too late to process Oct production for payment today.

Stacey/Sharon: Please adjust the payment detail in Global so that the terms flow downstream to Unify for next month's production.

Also; Lisa, Mary, Stacey & Sharon - - - - how common are the requests for payment date adjustments? I'd assume (former life experience) that the larger producers or those who process royalty or related payments require payment on the 25th due to their responsiblities. If this is common - - - instead of repairing after the fact - - - - do we have a list of customers that we should automatically adjust the payment terms within Global & likewise to that of the GTC template?

Gerald - - - - Hi! I'm over here in Confirms now. What is your input on this issue or to that of the common occurrence? Also, as the 'new kid' - - - - are their any future protocols I should know of???


Thanks all!!!!

Subject:	RE: Constellation Energy Source, Inc., CP 55358

Darren,

My apologies!  I thought you were looking for physical gas deals/contracts.  Yes, you are right.  We have a fairly new ISDA in place with Constellation Power Source, Inc.   Please work with Georgi Landau or Anthony Campos regarding contract information on these financial transactions.  Joe Hunter and/or Bob Bowen can help you with the confirmations once these deals are rebooked.  You will need to work with the trader or risk person who input the deals to have them moved.

Any physical power contract issues should be addressed to Rhonda Denton.

The deal extending through 08/31/01 I referenced earlier is Sitara deal 943572.  We have had numerous other firm baseload deals over the last year that were entered as ICC Energy Corporation.  You should probably check with Andy Ring or Scott Hendrickson regarding those deals.  I can give you deal numbers if you'd like.

I hope this clears up some of the confusion.  I'm a little concerned that ICC doesn't acknowledge the deals we have entered.  Please let me know what you find out on those.

Please let me know if you need any other information.

Thanks,

Here are the TAGG#s for the deals currently in place with Constellation Energy Source Inc:

Deal Date           TAGG #            Ending Date
02/01/01               QP3345.1         12/01/02
02/14/01               QS0083.1         10/01/01
02/14/01               QS0088.1         03/1/02

03/20/01               QY0135.1/.2     12/01/02
07/27/01               VS1811.1         12/01/03

According to TAGG, only the QV9858.1/.2 confirms have been ""executed"" with the remainder marked as ""sent to counterparty."" It is my belief that the deals should have been rebooked to Constellation Power Source, Inc where we have an executed ISDA dated 3/28/01, Global Contract #96057479. In addition, we also have an executed Master Power dated 2/20/01, Global Contract #96061846.

I have also spoken with ICC Energy Corporation, a WMBE counterparty and verified that we do not have any transactions through 8/31/01 with Constellation Energy Source Inc as the ultimate payee.

I think that if we work with the counterparty, they will verify that the deals should confirmed under the ISDA.

Cheryl,

I have reviewed the current contracts and deals in place with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. (CP ID 55358) and found that we have deals extending through 08/31/01.  However, the only current deals are with ICC Energy Corporation (an alternate payee under our contract with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. ).  There are NO current deals with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. at this time.

We currently have two master contracts in place as well as two spot GTCs.  I imagine that we will need to terminate all these agreements, but Legal is unaware of any changes with this counterparty.  Darren, can you please provide Stacy Dickson with the name of your contact at Constellation?  

We also do not have ANY master agreements in place with Constellation Power Source, Inc. - all business (telephonic and EOL) is being covered under GTCs.  Stacy or Debra, do we have any negotiations in place for a master under this name?  Darren, can you work with Stacy on this?

Please let me know if we need to terminate or trade suspend the Constellation Energy Source, Inc. agreements.

Hi Stacey,

Got a request from Darren in Credit, to change the status of the subject CP to non-trading.  When I made the change, I got the edit that indicates that 8 contracts are still active on the record, and the maintenance group is HOUGAS.  Per Darren, all trades should be under CP ID 55134, i/no/ Constellation Power Source, Inc.  I just want to make sure those can be moved if the record is in a non-trading status.

This is also flagged for EES, should that link and retail flag be added to the Constellation Power Source record, even though it is not known to be one of EES's customers at this time, or at least it hasn't been flagged as such at this time?  I also went in to make that change, but since you are working on those contracts, I wanted to run it by you first.

       2.   Purchase Price.  The purchase price for the Subject Property to be paid
  by Buyer to Seller for the Subject Property shall be
  ___________________________________ Dollars ($ ____________) in cash due
  and payable by cashier's check made payable to Seller and delivered to Seller
  contemporaneously with the receipt by Buyer of the Cash Sale executed by Seller
  and vesting all of Seller's ownership interest in and to the Subject Property in Buyer.

       3.   Not an Option.  This is not an option, but it is an executory contract to
  buy and sell and it shall be so construed in all respects.  No Party may withdraw from
  this Agreement all Parties grant unto each other and reserve unto themselves the
  absolute right to demand specific performance of this Agreement.

       4.   Warranties by Seller.  Seller's interest in and to the Subject Property is
  and will be transferred to and accepted by Buyer ""AS IS, WHERE IS"" AND IN ITS
  PRESENT CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR.  BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
  SELLER HAS NOT MADE, AND SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND
  NEGATES, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR
  IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE CONDITION OR QUALITY OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY,
  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES UNDER
  APPLICABLE LAW NOW OR HEREAFTER IN EFFECT, AND ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS
  WARRANTY REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. BUYER HAS INSPECTED THE
  SUBJECT PROPERTY AND HAS SATISFIED ITSELF AS TO THE PHYSICAL AND

  NOT LIMITED TO CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE PRESENCE, RELEASE
  OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES.  BUYER EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL
  CLAIMS TO ANY AND ALL REDHIBITORY DEFECTS AND/OR VICES AND ALL CLAIMS
  BASED ON THE FITNESS OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FOR ANY INTENDED PURPOSE.
  BUYER IS RELYING SOLELY UPON ITS OWN INSPECTION OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY
  AND BUYER SHALL ACCEPT ALL OF THE SAME IN AN ""AS IS, WHERE IS"" CONDITION.
  THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE FACE OF THIS PURCHASE
  AND SALE AGREEMENT AS TO THE SUBJECT PROPERTY.

       5.   INDEMNITIES.   BUYER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, REIMBURSE AND
  HOLD SELLER, ITS PARENT AND AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE ""SELLER
  GROUP"") FREE AND HARMLESS FROM ANY COSTS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES (WHETHER
  ON ACCOUNT OF PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH OR ON ACCOUNT OR PROPERTY
  DAMAGE) OR CAUSES OF ACTION AND LOSSES OF WHATSOEVER NATURE
  (INCLUDING ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COURT COSTS) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN
  CONNECTION WITH OR IN ANY WAY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE
  SUBJECT PROPERTY, ON OR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
  SUCH COSTS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, CAUSES OF ACTION OR LOSSES ARE DUE TO
  SELLER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

       6.   Proration of Taxes.    All property, ad valorem and similar taxes
  applicable to the Subject Property shall be prorated as of the Effective Date between
  Seller and Buyer. Such proration shall be final and shall not be the subject of
  adjustment after the final bills are rendered.  Buyer shall be responsible for all taxes,
  except income taxes of Seller, and prepare all tax filings, in respect to the Subject
  Property that are required to be paid or filed after the Effective Date.  To the extent
  that any such taxes filed and paid by Buyer are prorated hereunder, Seller shall
  promptly pay, upon of receipt of an invoice therefor from Buyer, its pro rata share of
  same.  All taxes, except Seller's income taxes, occasioned by reason of this sale,
  whether real, personal or mixed, shall be borne and paid solely by Buyer.  If, for the
  current ad valorem tax year, the taxable value of the Subject Property that is the
  subject of this Agreement is determined by a special appraisal method that allows for
  appraisal of the property at less than market value, the person to whom the property
  is transferred may not be allowed to qualify the Subject Property for that special
  appraisal in a subsequent tax year and the Subject Property may then be appraised
  at its full market value.  In addition, the transfer of the Subject Property or a
  subsequent change in the use of the property may result in the imposition of an
  additional tax plus interest as a penalty for the transfer of the change in the use of
  the land. Buyer acknowledges that there shall be no proration for, and Buyer shall be
  responsible for, payment of any ""roll back"" taxes or any other redetermination of
  property taxes assessed or relating to the year of the closing and years preceding the
  year of closing due or based upon any change in the use of the Subject Property at
  and after the closing hereunder.

  7.        Disputes.   Any dispute relating to this Agreement shall be resolved by
  binding, self-administered arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
  the American Arbitration Association (""AAA"") and all such proceedings shall be
  subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.  A single arbitrator shall be selected under the
  expedited rules of the AAA.  Only damages allowed pursuant to this Agreement may
  be awarded and the arbitrator shall have no authority to award consequential, treble,
  exemplary or punitive damages of any type under any circumstances regardless of
  whether such damages may be available under Louisiana law. The arbitrator shall
  have the power to award the remedy of specific performance. The results of such
  arbitration shall be conclusive and binding, provided, however, that both Parties shall
  have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such equitable relief as
  is necessary to preserve and enforce their rights under this Agreement.
  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, either Party may join the other
  Party to any action, suit or proceeding with respect to which the Party seeking such
  joinder is a defendant, if the other Party is required to defend, indemnify, and hold
  harmless such defendant in accordance with the terms of the provisions hereof.
  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
  having a jurisdiction hereof.

  8.      Entirety and Severability.  This Agreement constitutes the entire
  agreement of the Parties related to the purchase and sale of the Subject Property.
  There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations (whether oral
  or written) affecting the Subject Property other than those herein expressed.  In case
  any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason
  be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
  or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement
  shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never
  been herein contained.

  9.      Governing Law.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED UNDER AND
  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA AND FEDERAL LAW
  AS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 7 ABOVE.

  10.     Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement, and all of the terms and
  provisions hereof, shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties
  hereto, and their respective successors and assigns.

  11.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
  counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and need not be signed
  by more than one of the Parties and all of which shall constitute one and the same
  agreement.

       12.  Further Assurances.  Each Party agrees that it will promptly perform all
  other acts and execute and deliver all other documents as may be necessary or
  appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

       13.  Attorney's Fees.  In the event of the commencement of an arbitration
  proceeding or a breach of any of the provisions contained herein by either Party, the
  prevailing Party shall be entitled to collect from the other Party, as part of its
  damages for said breach, reasonable attorneys' fees associated with enforcing or
  defending any provision hereof.

       14.  Amendments. This Agreement may be modified or amended only in
  writing signed by both Parties which expressly refers to this Agreement and states an
  intention to modify or amend it.  No such amendment or modification shall be
  effected by use of any purchase order, acknowledgment, invoice or other form of
  either Party and in the event of conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any
  such form, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

       15.  Waiver.  A waiver by either Party of a breach of any of the terms of
  this Agreement by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent
  breach of the terms of this Agreement.  The failure of any Party to insist upon strict
  performance of any provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right under it
  shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.

       16.  Termination.  This Agreement shall expire and shall be of no further
  force or effect Ninety (90) days from the Effective Date unless prior to such time the
  Parties have entered into an act of Cash Sale transferring the Subject Property from
  the Seller to the Buyer.

       Each Party does hereby execute this Agreement as of the ________ day of
  ______, 2001.

assurance that the property has never had underground storage tanks or

  Rup,  Got a voicemail at the house from a Michael Moore (wasn't that the
guy in the Halloween movies who killed everybody) concerning a reunion for
the Class of '91.  His number is 641-357-6375.  You can go back and show
all those losers what a big important man you have become.

A blonde walks into a pharmacy and asks the assistant for some 
rectum deodorant. 
The pharmacist, a little bemused, explains to the woman they 
don't sell rectum deodorant, and never have. 
Unfazed, the blonde assures the pharmacist that she has been 
buying the stuff from this store on a regular basis, and would 
like some more. 
""I'm sorry,"" says the pharmacist, ""we don't have any."" 
""But I always get it here,"" says the blonde. 
""Do you have the container it comes in?"" asks the pharmacist 
""Yes,"" said the blonde, ""I'll go home and get it."" 
She returns with the container and hands it to the pharmacist who 
looks at it and says to her, 
""This is just a normal stick of underarm deodorant."" 
Annoyed, the blonde snatches the container back and reads out 
loud from the container, 
""TO APPLY, PUSH UP BOTTOM.""

"El Paso Transportation Values - CONFIDENTIAL","Armando, further to our conversations please find attached my calculation of the values we are seeing in the marketplace. The information provided is for discussions between Mexicana and ENA and is not to be distributed to any other party. 

As discussed, ENA's economics are based on a variety of assumptions including volumes ( that actually flow ), basis market, tariffs, and credit, not withstanding the paper we will be looking at executing. 

I believe Enron is your best choice in counterparties and we very much welcome the opportunity to act on your behalf as Agent in the liquidation of the transportation on El Paso.  

In summary, and as previously discussed I would like to submit a term sheet to you based on a summary of the documents and steps we will need to impliment to get this agreement in place. Here are just a few of the important doc's and potential next steps:

NEXT STEPS:
?	Mexicana needs to decided on confirm that you have chosen ENRON NORTH AMERICA to act as your AGENT. 
?	If ENRON is deemed agent then we need to ""Accelerate' the steps in the documents summary.


DOCUMENTS:
?	Drafting and execution of Agency agreement  between Mexicana and ENA
?	Drafting and execution of physical confirm  to facilitate the Monthly and Daily purchases ENA will make at the border ( Topack) with Mexicana
?	Potential Deemed ISDA agreement to facilitate swaps ( to hedge spreads if so desired ).
?	ENA requires ( copy of By-Laws ), even if they are in spanish, we will need these to take next step ( we have the ability to review internally) 
?	ENA requires power of attorney documentation
?	Execution of Agency agreement between Mexicana, El Paso Natural Gas and ENA. 
?	Satisfactory credit review

"Enron Gas Processing Company","Dear Steve:  The Texas Railroad Commission doesn't have anything in its records that certain assets held by the subject company were divested to KN Processing, Inc., a subsidiary of KN Energy, Inc. on 3/31/1997.  We've tried to tell the Texas Railroad Commission that we no longer own this company, but since KN hasn't filed the proper reports for a number of wells for which it is shown to be a gas nominator and/or gas gatherer, the Commission is still looking to us to file reports like the P-5 for this entity.

Do you remember who handled the sale of this company to KN Processing, Inc.?  I don't know where to begin to do the research about this company or these wells.  

Please advise, and thanks,
Mary

Mr. Nemec -

This email is a follow-up to my voice message to you last week regarding the above-referenced document.  I work with Bill Mathews in the Denver office and we are preparing a compression administration agreement between Bear Paw Energy and Independent Production.  We are working off of your agreement and I was wondering if you could email me (tricia.flanigan@enron.com) the above-referenced agreement.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 720-946-3661.

Thank you,

"FW: Devon SFS deal #679736","Gerald,

Can you or anyone else who will be working on ENA Upstream contracts let me know if you get any future requests for confirmations or contracts that are for ENA Upstream? All of the purchase deals from the Originations or Mid-marketers for ENA Upstream going forward should be on the Committed Reserves confirmations and that usually does not get communicated so it can be put on the appropriate confirm/contract.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Gerald:  I have already completed #1. On #2, they just want some
assurance that the property has never had underground storage tanks or
other hazardous waste sources on it.  I believe a letter from LRCI
stating that to its knowledge there have been no such sources on or
under the Property would suffice.  As far as #3, my abstractor has
promised to complete this limited title search today.  I hope to hear
from him tommorrow.

Subject:	Timeline for Permitting Napoleonville Storage No


Rusty, this is the proposed timetable I sent to Joe for Comment.  I spoke
with him this morning and he agreed to look it over.  He has not yet
reviewed the application. I told him to let me know if there are any
deficiencies in the application when he looks it over. When are you sending
me a copy of the permit application. <<266676_1.doc>>

I also talked to Joe about the possibility of dewatering prior to the final
order.  If needed, Joe said a work permit could be issued which would allow
dewatering.  This is based on a liberal interpretation of the regs, however.

"GMAT Review available at Enron","
GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th:
The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be
honored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a
waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Keith,
 
Please let me know your timing on the Sorrento Pipeline matter I forwarded to you Saturday.  As you can see from the following, Sorrento is a bit anxious.  I will be out Wednesday through next Tuesday, so it would be great if we can touch base before then.  Please give me a call when you have a chance.

Subject:	Master Netting Agreements Reminder

Reminder - If you are working on a Master Netting Agreement, you also need to understand what type of entities are being included in the netted group.  On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).  Mary is working on a new draft of the MNA to be used if we are not superceding the underlying margining terms. Thanks

"RE: Comments to O&M Agreement","Gerald,
My comments noted.  A few points:   as I read the contract, client is paying for the insurance cost of BCCKOP, and therefore should get full benefit of those policies, not just limited to claims attributable to BCCKOP's gross negligence/willful misconduct.  BCCKOP is in full control of the Facility and therefore should wear some financial risk for damage to it arising out of the Operating Services.  I have limited this to $100k per occurrence (our deductible for non-power gen assets is $1MM). I've also made them take deductibles under their policies for third party liability and employee injury risks (they had these on us originally), and specified that their GL cover include pollution legal liability (they had this on us also, but since it's a third party risk I think it should stay with the operator).
Call me if I've got this wrong or if we need to discuss further.   

Thx,

David

"Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","
The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Subject:	Napoleonville land sale


Gary,

Per our conversation on July 11, I would like to reiterate that an Enron entity is interested in selling approximately 330 acres of land at the Napoleonville salt dome in Louisiana.  This land is divided into two tracts, one of about 256 acres and the other about 73 acres in size.

Enron recently received $15,000 per acre in a separate land transaction at Napoleonville, and this sets the market price that we expect to receive in the above proposed land sale.  

Does Dow have interest in this land?  Is this price within your range?  If so, I would encourage you to draft a proposal from Dow within the next two weeks, if possible.  

This email does not constitute an offer, but is solely provided for informational purposes.  

Let's discuss this at your earliest convenience.  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last Thursday, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!  

Sincerely, 
Eva Rainer

"Upstream--Storage Group Legal & Regulatory Research","Jeff and Gerald,

I wanted you both to have the following information: (i) the legal/regulatory research questions that the Upstream Storage Group (Paul Bieniawski, Miguel Vasquez & Eva Rainer) have posed to LeBoeuf Lamb (law firm) and Brown Williams (rate consultant) and (ii) the two Reports produced in response to such questions.  The Reports were delivered to the Storage Group personnel Friday, July 27, 2001, and were forwarded to me by Bob Neustaedter last Friday, August 3, 2001.  

The cost of this work was borne jointly by Jean Mrha's Upstream Group and the Regulatory Affairs Group; Donna Fulton, Sarah Novosel, and Bob Neustaedter are the Regulatory/Governmental Affairs individuals involved in retaining Brown Williams and in recommending Larry Acker at LeBoeuf to conduct the legal/regulatory research.  I reviewed the engagement letters on behalf of the Regulatory Affairs Department.  The combined cost of these reports is about $100,000.

I've done the best I can to be sure that the Upstream Storage Group does not ""overlook"" the Legal Department as it forges ahead into a transactional arena fraught with significant regulatory and accounting risks and traps.  Gerald, as you have become involved with the development scenarios that involve a compression component, I think it would be wise to become familiar with the contents of both the LeBoeuf Lamb and Brown Williams Reports.

If either of you would like to discuss the legal, regulatory or political implications of the attached, please feel free to give me a call.

Steve

My Enron 401k quintupled in the last three days.  Wish it had started at $26
instead of 26 cents.  Nevertheless, I am back to using a comma when I write

"New Legal Team to Assist RAC","	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Chris & Chuck -- I have reviewed the draft Confidentiality Agreement in

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Have you had time to work on developing the GTC Firm Point based confirmation for the deals that are bought at a point but are not Committed Reserves (i.e. Month-long wellhead deals)?

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

"FW: Final Settlement Statement and Amendment to Master Services Agreement","Georganne, this agreement will be executed Monday, dated as of Fri, Sept 28. I am out of the office on Monday, but by this e-mail I am asking Gerald Nemec to forward to you a copy of the executed agreement.  Will you please oversee the removal of the transportation positions from the MTM books as of Sept 30 (you mentioned Jeff Gosset?). The 3Q removal is important as Northern Border will be recognizing income as a result of the agreement.  We have already discussed (casually at last Monday's mtg) our accounting. We will probably need to discuss the Purchase Price Adjustment due ENA, as it has been negotiated and is being netted against the amounts due to Northern for the transportation capacity (we are the net payor). Generally speaking, AA may notice, if so, let me know, although clearly the acctg risks in this deal belong to Northern.

"Linder Oil confirmations","Ellen,

Based on some additional information from Linder regarding their Pre-pay deal, the confirmations for the August confirmations as well as any confirmations that we prepare through the end of the Pre-payment deal that runs through October will need to be GTC Firm confirmations with modified MDQ language.  Please get with Gerald Nemec if you have questions regarding how to prepare the MDQ language. 

Also, please prepare these confirmations as soon as possible. The pre-pay paperwork must go out to the customer by August 10th; and Stacy Dickson needs the confirmations in order to complete the pre-pay contract.

Thanks,
Judy

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Shane,

The three companies in question need to submit a form that delegates the authority you have listed below to Enron Net Works, LLC, your employer.  Then, you, in your position with Enron Net Works, LLC, can have the access which your request.

We need to be VERY careful about how we treat the various Enron legal entities.  Enron Net Works, LLC is NOT a subsidary of ENA.  It is wholly owned by Enron Corp.  Also, it is separate from the three entities which hold transportion contracts.  It cannot act on behalf of those companies without a delegation of authority.

I comment Kim and Jim for their astute question.

Subject:	RE: Enron North America

         These three companies are subsidiaries of Enron North America/Enron Networks.
        I work for the Electronic Business Development Group of Enron North America.  My job is to initiate Trading Partner Agreements with pipelines and implement EdI nominations for the schedulers.  In order to accomplish this, I need access to the pipeline's EBB sites.  I have to send nomination via EDI or flat file.  I have to check to be sure my noms hit the pipe's web sites.  I also need to get a list of the meter numbers and other pertinent information.  Most pipes do not have this set up in the test environment.  I have to also test in production before rolling this out to the schedulers.
Enron MW, enovate and Enron Upstream are separate shippers with either their own Trading partner agreements or amendments designating Enron North America as the  third party provider, however, they do not have their own EBB group.  Donna Greif, Richard pinion and myself are their EBB group.. . All electronic noms are sent via Enron North America.  The schedulers will or already have access to your web site.  I could use their IDs to test but
I have my own IDs for at least 22 other pipes that these three companies do business with, therefore, I am confused why this request sounds odd.

If you need more clarification, please feel free to call me.


Thank you

Shane works for Enron Net Works LLC.
If Enron Net Works LLC is a designee of these three companies, then she can have access.
If not, she cannot have access.
Why don't you have her give me a call.
The request sounds a little odd.

   Thanks for setting me up on ETS and Northern Border as ENA.

   I  would also like to get access to all four of these pipes for ENA's other entities, such as
  enovate, LLC, Enron MW and ENA Upstream.  We are not agents for these entities but a 'third party service provider"".  I need access in order to test edi noms.
  Once I send files for these in production, I have to log onto to their EBB sites and view the noms,scheduled quantities etc.
Do I need new user ID for each of these entities or can you use  the same ID as  ENA's.

Call me if you have any questions.

Police, Ferentz probe incident at bar
By MEGAN MANFULL and TOM WITOSKY
Register Staff Writer
09/28/2001

Iowa City, Ia. - A criminal investigation is under way into an alleged
assault that involves at least one member of the Iowa football team.
Tom Widmer, an Iowa City police captain, said Wednesday that the
investigation began early Sunday morning after police responded to a call
from a bar named Etc. The tavern is located in the downtown Iowa City
pedestrian mall.
""It is an active investigation,"" Widmer said.
Widmer said police received the call about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. He declined to
identify any suspects.
Ryan Rooney, a manager at Etc., said at least one assailant was a member of
the Iowa football team. He would not identify the player or say if more than
one player was involved.
Rooney said one of his bartenders sustained a concussion from the assault
and required medical attention.
""It was more of a jumping than a fight,"" he said.
Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said Thursday morning he was looking into the
matter. He said he was told of the incident Wednesday evening.
""I'm fuzzy on the details right now,"" Ferentz said. ""A player told a coach
about something that took place, and then they told me. I'm going to look
into what happened and get more details about it.
""I want to find out if anything did happen . . . then I will see if any
action needs to be taken on the team.""
Iowa's season already has been marred by one violent assault. Offensive
lineman Sam Aiello attacked quarterback Jon Beutjer in July, although the
incident did not become public until the first week of the season.
Beutjer said he received a concussion, although he did not file a report
with police. He later left Iowa and enrolled at Illinois, saying he felt
betrayed by the school's handling of the incident.
Ferentz said he had not been contacted by police about the incident at Etc.
A report obtained from police says two people were injured at Etc. Rooney
said the second victim, a woman, was ""shaken up pretty bad.""
Kevin Prestegard, the investigating officer, confirmed Thursday the probe
was continuing, but refused further comment.
""It all depends on the police and how diligently they will pursue this,""
Rooney said. ""They have a lengthy amount of time before they have to do
something. If they are season ticket holders, I wouldn't be surprised if
they wait until December.""
Police declined to respond to Rooney's comment.

"Mandatory Setoff Language for Inclusion in all EWS Trading Contracts","
One of the most important credit tools available to help Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) manage counterparty credit risk is setoff rights.  This is particularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous commodity lines, including gas, power, coal, steel, pulp and paper, each of which may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty.  This complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliated entities to trade the various commodities.  Absent express contractual setoff rights, EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master contracts.

	A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that will substantially enhance EWS's credit position with counterparties with whom we trade multiple commodities.  This setoff language, which is set forth below, must be in all EWS trading form contracts.  Similarly, when negotiating on third party paper, we should request that this additional setoff language be added.


MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR 
EWS TRADING CONTRACTS

	(A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date, the Non-Defaulting Party (""X"") may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party (""Y"") by X or any Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of X's Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y notice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section __, ""Owed"" shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.  	

	Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section __ may be converted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted. If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section __shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law.   This setoff provision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, off-set, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represent and acknowledge that the rights set forth in this Section __ are an integral part of the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  The parties further acknowledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Section ___, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section __ and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to Section ___.

	(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party any amount under Section __ until the Non-Defaulting Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the Non-Defaulting Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied.

	This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts due and owing as of the Early Termination Date (but does not include future payments) between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates (triangular setoff) after the designation of an Early Termination Date.  This language has been reviewed by U.S. bankruptcy counsel, and is appropriate under U.S. laws for commodity transactions with U.S.-based counterparties.  Each group will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdiction in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability.   In addition, prior to introducing this language into your forms, changes will be required to terminology and/or to include terminations resulting from events other than Events of Default (e.g. ""Affected Party"" under ISDA).  Finally, when incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms, please be aware that this language is not intended to override the payment netting terms (monthly netting of receivables) or the close-out netting procedures (applicable upon the designation of an Event of Default), both of which should remain in the trading forms.  Rather, this language is only intended to add setoff rights to all EWS trading forms.  When incorporating this setoff language into your trading forms, you will need to review the forms to determine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that will need to be overridden and/or coordinated.  Finally, in order to assist all lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions, we are in the process of preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutually beneficial to EWS and our counterparties, which explanation you will be able to share with your counterparties. This explanation will be distributed shortly.

	If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-6544 or Elizabeth Sager at 713-853-6349.

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.

"Enron Center South Occupancy","This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Office of the Chairman

More was accomplished at the conference than I expected.  Note that a follow-up conference is tentatively scheduled for August 28.  I think the full requirements customers have finally gotten the message that they will have to accept some defined level of service.  It was also clear that El Paso does not have sufficient capacity to serve everybody's full load all the time and they will have to, at the least, credit demand charges when they cannot serve their firm shippers, and may even be required to expand their system.

I realize the final decision to move these deals have not been made. Judy Thorne is meeting with Hunter Shively in the morning, we might have some more information then.
Anyway, I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to get together to discuss what needs to happen if/when the deals are moved before the fact rather then after.

Lets still meet tomorrow, then if nothing else we can come up with a list of contract and operational issues that we can present to the commercial heads....right?

Gerald,

On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions, the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery.  I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template.  Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts.

I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on.  Are we close to having a final version?  Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

Please get back to me as soon as possible (I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now).  Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

Tyrell, 

CSU is pretty picky about using our contracts for these deals.  There are several sections that we must have in a contract and those are all covered in our version.  Could you ask your legal if they could live with our contract?  If there is any language they would like to add, we can cover that ground as well.  Let me know if this will work for you.

"RE: Sale of Napoleonville Land","Louise,
 
On Monday, prior to my leaving for Buffalo,  I spoke with Dave Gorte and was informed that since the sale of the Napoleonville Land was greater than $2.5 MM, it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a DASH.  
 
Since the negotiations were quite contentious between Reliant, Texas Brine and Enron - we (Eva, Lisa and myself) had worked with Mr. Gorte to create multiple versions of the DASH.  It was not until Wednesday afternoon that Reliant was the chosen ""victor.""  In addition, since I felt you were apprised of the deal and Mr. Gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process, Lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule.
 
Unfortunately, this meant Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm, but we had been informed by Tammi Schoppe that you were available until 5 pm. Even though the banks were closed, I had wanted to sign the executables on Wednesday so Reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend.  It was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction.
 
I will be flying back to Houston today and will be landing around 5 pm.  Both Eva Rainer and Lisa Druzbik are in today and I am leaving instructions to (hopefully) close the deal today.  Julie Gomez will be signing on my behalf -- for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to Eva.  My cell is 713-302-4187.

At 4pm on Wednesday Liza arrived with the DASH.  It had not been circulated prior to that and there was no-one available to discuss the deal as Eva was not in the office.  Please  have someone ready to discuss this deal and circulate the DASH in advance of when you want it signing.

4pm on Wednesday with no briefing on the deal didn't give enough time to complete a DASH.

Louise, 

Tomorrow, I am flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving with my father.  As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:

Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM. 
Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the ""Act of Sale"" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental). 


I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding ""war"" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.

Regards, Mrha

Two men were about to tee off on the 18th tee box.
Their wives were waiting for them at the club house.
The first golfer tee's his ball.  As he addresses the
ball, he looks at the club house.  Then he chokes up
on the club.  He looks at the ball and then up at the
club house.  He loosens his grip and closes his
stance.  He again looks at the club house. He again
looks down at his ball and chokes up a little more on
his golf club.  He looks back up at the club house.
Finally his partner says ""Forget it, you can't hit her
from here"".

"RE: Frito Lay","Stacy and Gerald -

There are no credit concerns with respect to Frito-Lay, but I have a question surrounding the ""Adequate Assurances"" language.  In the ""Special Provisions"" document below, Item 6 states  ""When reasonable grounds for insecurity of payment or title to the Gas arise"".  Does this issue of ""title to the Gas"" suggest that the gas SUPPLIER might be forced to post adequate assurance?

As you know, we are managing capital very carefully right now, and any provisions that might give a counterparty legal right to call for collateral should be negotiated out of contracts.  Please let me know what you think about this issue.

Thanks,

JRW

Gerald & Stacy,

I didn't which of you would have the most time to deal with this, but, I am responding to an RFP for provide gas to several Frito Lay plants in California for the term Dec, 2001 through October, 2003.  It will be a full-requirments transaction whereby we manage the imbalance and transportation.  Based on the request, they would like to execute a GISB with special provisions that I have attached.  I have also included a confirmation form they would like to use to confirm the transaction for each of their facilities.

ALL REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS TO THIS CONTRACT FORM MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH THE RFP RESPONSE which will be emailed to them by noon central time on Thursday, Nov. 15.  Sorry for the rush, I just received the RFP yesterday and didn't realize this was a stipulation until just now.  No modifications indicates that the proposed language is acceptable.

I am also attaching the RFP itself.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  this will be a pretty standard full-requirements offer.  Please let me know if you have any questions or what I can do to help.

Thanks,

Kim

"Job Status","Hey Gerald, I was talking with Kenny Smith about LRC, and the people associated with HPL that went over with AEP, when I thought of a certain facility planner. I looked at the Enron directory, and found that you were still with Enron. I presume you're still with ENA. Are you still working contracts with them? I had a chance to speak with Kevin Kuehler a few months ago, and according to him AEP is busy relooking at all kind of possibilities (old estimates). I don't know how long that kind of enthusiasm will last. AEP will probably find out (what ENA already knew) how hard it is to make some good margins.

Let me know how things are with you these days.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

We now have a fully executed Master Firm Purchase/Sale contract between ENA and ENA Upstream. I am forwarding the originals to Gerald Nemec, and he will get a copy sent to you. The confirmation language states that ""Any Transaction may be formed and effectuated (i) by a written paper-based Transaction Agreement executed by the Parties...or (ii) in a recorded telephone conversation between the Parties...""

It will be a full-requirments transaction whereby we manage the imbalance and transportation.  Based on the request, they would like to execute a GISB with special provisions that I have attached.  I have also included a confirmation form they would like to use to confirm the transaction for each of their facilities.

ALL REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS TO THIS CONTRACT FORM MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH THE RFP RESPONSE which will be emailed to them by noon central time on Thursday, Nov. 15.  Sorry for the rush, I just received the RFP yesterday and didn't realize this was a stipulation until just now.  No modifications indicates that the proposed language is acceptable.

I am also attaching the RFP itself.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  this will be a pretty standard full-requirements offer.  Please let me know if you have any questions or what I can do to help.

RE: Tax Refunds

 The amount of your payment is based on the taxable income shown on your
 2000 return. The amount is 5% of your taxable income up to a maximum of
 $300 for a single taxpayer, $500 for head of household and $600 for a
 married couple filing jointly. If your tax liability after nonrefundable
 credits is less than these maximum amounts, your limit is the smaller of
 this amount or 5% of your taxable income. If you did not have a tax
 liability for 2000 but do have one for 2001, you may be able to claim the
 tax credit on your 2001 return.

 This means for those of you who made at least $6000 in taxable income
 last year (2000), you will receive $300 back on the date scheduled below:

"Bridgeline","Lou/Gerald

My understanding is that Bridgeline is a pipeline joint venture in which we own a 40% equity interest (but share control 50/50).  The other owner is Texaco.  Earlier in the year, we were looking at trying to sell our interest but there is a ROFR in the Contribution Agreement which restricts our ability to do this.  I believe that the ROFR expires in March or April of next year and am curious to know what impact ENA's bankruptcy may have on this ROFR.  In other words, will the bankruptcy filing have the effect of invalidating the ROFR?  The answer may depend on the actual owners of Enron's equity interest.

Gerald - would you please provide any information about Bridgeline that may be helpful in answering these questions and also confirm the information provided above.  While this is not a fire that needs to be put out immediately, there are a number of issues relating to Bridgeline that should be dealt with simultaneously (and some of those other issues do require more immediate attention).  Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Hey Dude,  How is it going?  Was thinking about maybe making a road trip
next weekend the big A.  What do you have going on?  Might just be
myself though.  Barbara and I had a parting of the ways.  Relationships
seems to give me the panics after a couple of months.  Right now I am
working on recharging the girlfriend pipeline.

"Re: Saturday Night Fever","
Let me just bring everyone up to speed on the det's of Saturday's super-def
throwdown jam:

Start time:  8 bells
Seating:  Limited
Booze available:  Cheap beer and select liquors from my personal stock
Dress code:  Shabby Sheik aka GeoWear
Address:  2735 Steel Street

So in review, if you have lawnchairs you might want to bring some along for
yard overflow seating.  As for the sauce, if you prefer a certain gourmet
beer bring it with you cause you aint gettin' it here.  Liquor and wine is
always welcomed.  The location is just down the street from Carrie Nolan's
for those of you who have been to parties at her place--those of you that
haven't, first of all your lucky, and secondly, here's where we're at:  One
street north of Alabama, west of Kirby Drive (Directly west of the Whole
foods).  The street has a canopy of trees and is lined with apartments,
were at the west end of the apartment complex, just look for the jugglers
and mimes performing outside.

Look forward to seeing all of you, at least as long as I can see.

Cheers,
Ryan

Debra,

All of the thresholds and Mac's on the contract look good.  However, please confirm in which name the contract will be executed as, please.  I think that the contract should be executed with Atmos Energy Corporation.  In which case all of the references to Customer in the contract will have to be changed (as they all currently refer to Greeley Gas Company, a div....).  The problem is that we do term deals with Atmos as well (most of them) and if it is a division of the contract should be with Atmos and not Greeley Gas, a div.

Thanks and sorry about the delay,

Veronica

 Please look at the attached redline from Greeley regarding the credit sections.  As you may recall a previous discussion regarding the exact name for the contract, the contract will be in the name of Atoms Energy Corp.  Please let me know asap.  Thanks

"1-URGENT - Outlook Email Notification (new)","OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: Monday, June 11th

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

"Organization Changes","Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

Hey guys.  I went to Expedia.com and found the Delta Flights Referenced below for $226/person.  This is still a really good deal and I would jump all over it if I were you.  Here are the flights:

Friday, August 24 Delta #4516 IAH to ATL (departs 10:10am, arrives 1:15pm)
		   Delta #4107 ATL to MYR (departs 2:55pm, arrives 4:36pm)

Sunday, August 26 Delta #4684 MYR to ATL (departs 11:40am, arrives 12:55pm)
		     Delta #2063 ATL to IAH (departs 3:50pm, arrives 4:56pm)

For those of you who don't know how to use Expedia.com.  Just go to the website (www.expedia.com) , search flights from Houston to Myrtle Beach on the above dates and select the flights that work best for you.  You can input your frequent flier number and pay online via credit card.

Good luck and let me know if I can help at all.

Bruce

PS - If you can schedule your flights at the same time, you can share a rental car out of Myrtle Beach, SC as well.  It is about a 40 mile drive north to Ocean Isle, NC . . . site of the wedding.

Stacy,  Susan called and asked that I prepare an assignment letter.  I will do so.  Could you send me a copy of the contract we are assigning and a copy of the assignment in interest letter.  Thanks.

OK folks, here's an update on Holcomb Oil and Gas Inc./Key Gas Holding, LLC.  The only active contract we have in place with Holcomb is an Enfolio II Spot and the interest assignment letter sent by Holcomb does not cover an agreement so broad.  I spoke with Susan Herrera at Holcomb [(505) 326-0550] and asked her to send an assignment letter.  She didn't seem to really understand what I needed to I also gave her Gerald's number in Legal.

Once we receive a good assignment, I will request that the Global Counterparty group set up the CP.  Sharon will process the assignment at that point.  Depending on whether we want to split deal 901255 or repath will depend on how long this process takes.  I will keep everyone informed in the meantime.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Kelli,

I'm not sure who normally submits request to the Global Counterparty group when you have new counterparties, but here is a link to the Lotus Notes request form.  You should be able to be see all the pertinent information needed by the GCP group besides contact name and address.  If you can supply this information, I'd be happy to submit the request for you.  Otherwise, please let me know if you find someone to finish this.  I don't have access to change the counterparty on the deal, so my group will not be able to attach a contract until the counterparty is there.

 << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

The Perfect Couple

Once upon a time, a perfect man and a perfect woman met. After a perfect
courtship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life together was, of course,
perfect.

One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfect couple was driving their
perfect car (a Grand Caravan) along a winding road, when they noticed
someone at the side of the road in distress. Being the perfect couple, they
stopped to help.

There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to
disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded
Santa and his toys into their vehicle. Soon they were driving along
delivering toys.

Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect couple
and Santa Claus had an accident. Only one of them survived the accident.

The mind numbing question is: Who was the survivor?

Scroll down for the answer...

The perfect woman survived. She's the only one who really existed in the
first place. Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus and there is no such
thing as a perfect man. Women stop reading here. That is the end of the
joke.

Men keep'a scrollin'...

So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the perfect woman must
have been driving. And that explains why there was a car accident. By the
way, if you're a woman and you're reading this, this illustrates another
point: Women never listen, either

Here is what I have so far for the draft confirmation for Mariner. As we discussed, I need you to add the language that states that at the Seller's option, we will release a given property for the remainder of the term of the contract if we are unable to move the gas from that property due to transportation.

Thanks,

"RE: Hello!","
Yea, someone should have warned you about the drinks being poured at the
ol' GK.  They tend to be pretty stiff.

...and ...""Swerve on?""  I have only a select group of friends who use such
terminology - you must be one of those cool-guy types!

A night out on Thursday sounds really good right now - maybe I will see
you.  Downing Street is one of my favorite low-key spots - a bit of a meat
market at times, but low key nonetheless.  Not to be rude, but to be
thorough rather, would you describe yourself as blond or more of a
brunette?

Yea, we definitely had our swerve on that night.  I will have to have a
talk with that bartender next time, because I was over-served.  Probably
not a good idea to start at GK at 6  and stay til 2 in the morning.

Thanks for your gracious response.  Let me tell you, I had much debate over
whether email was the appropriate communication medium or the phone.  I was
swung in favor of email to save myself the potential awkwardness of the
following phone conversation scenario:

     Jennifer:  ""Hello""
     Gerald:  ""Hi, Jennifer, this is Gerald.  We met at the Gallant Knight
on Friday""
     Jennifer:  ""Who?""

As I said Friday night was kind of hazy for me.  I'll probably be meeting
some friends for happy hour on Thursday night at Downing Street.  If you
and your friends are out, why don't you try and stop by.

Gerald.

   Of course I remember you.  GK is really a great spot on Fridays - Looked
   like you guys were having a good time!
   I found you quite nice as well, but I am currently dating someone.  No
   worries.  While I've never been a big fan of unconventional dating
   practices (i.e. hooking up over the internet), i do fancy your approach
   of
   straightforward and clever ingenuity!!  And if you ever want to just
   have
   lunch or a drink anyway, let me know.

   Jen

   P.S.   Tell Mike ""no worries""  as well!

   Hi Jennifer,  I don't know if you remember, but we met at Gallant Knight
   on Friday night.  I was with Mike Robison and the Enron group.  I had
   never been there before, but that place is alot of fun.  Definition of
   ""Swanky"".  You are probably wondering, ""Why is this guy emailing me!""
   We'll, I will be straightforward and say that I found you very charming.
   I wanted to see if you would be interested in meeting me for lunch or a
   drink afterwork!  I apologize in advance if you are dating or involved
   with someone, but I thought I would take that chance.

   P.S.  Mike gave me your email address, but don't hold it against him.
   ;-)

"Bridgeline Partnership and Storage/Transportation Deals","Ed and Gerald,

Brian and I spoke with Randy Curry of Bridgeline earlier today regarding a deal that we are trying to put together in order to sell the pad gas (in place) from Storage Caverns #13/#14.  During that conversation, Randy indicated that: (i) ENA's default under its storage and transport agreements with Bridgeline impacts the Bridgeline partnership itself (and that there are certain side agreements that spell this out) and (ii) Bridgeline would reject any efforts by ENA to remove its gas inventories from storage facilities owned by Bridgeline.  Bridgeline contends that ENA is permitted to pay all past due amounts and provide adequate assurances for future payment on its storage and transport deals as there is a bankruptcy order in place that allows the debtors to pay common carrier liens and warehouseman's liens.  I asked Randy whether he had sought a lawyer's opinion regarding whether Bridgeline could be properly classified as a common carrier and/or warehouseman - he said that he had.

Gerald please advise regarding Randy's assertions above.

Ed, please let me know if you are already looking into either of these matters.  If not, my guess is that you will be interested in hearing more.

Regards

Stuart

Further to your voice mail, let's put it together as is with the legal language covering oral discussions.  As for the Energy Transfer Group CA, I forgot what I requested as I verbally got it from Mike and then told it to you and did not write it down.  Let me know if you have the info, otherwise I'll call Mike back and discuss.

Two things;  1. The modification excludes all oral information.  So any confidential information that you guys orally give them is not protected. 2.  It might be a headache for you guys to remember to mark everything as confidential.  If you forget, it is not protected.  I think the changes should come out.

"CA with Powder River Energy","Hey Gerald!

I finally got my computer back up.  The name of the utility is Powder River Energy Corporation - A Touchstone Energy Cooperative (I don't know if you need that last part or not).  The relationship is this:

ECS is acting as the agent on behalf of Crestone Energy Ventures, LLC to purchase power and deliver shaft horsepower.  We will be buying electricity strictly off of PRECORP's tariff.  We will also be providing the cash for PRE to build transmission to the compressor site.  Right now, the deal term is for 10 years, starting in May '02, but we will begin negotiations with them immediately.  

Last week I met with three people from PRECORP, just to begin the relationship, one of which was Clarence Moshier (Chief Operating Officer for PRECORP), who I spoke to again yesterday.  He said that they would have no problem signing a CA with us.  Basically, I just want to make sure that whatever we put in place with PRECORP cannot be relayed to Crestone by them.

Anything else you need?

Andrew

Thanks.  As discussed earlier, I accepted all of your changes except the item in Section 14. 

In the meantime, we have reworked the language in Non-Binding Sections 12 & 13 to further clarify the power rates and terms.  Please review.  
 
Also, the Term language (in red) in Binding Section 1 below seems to give NICOR an out and seems to contradict the exclusivity clause?  Please explain.

Term.  This Agreement shall remain in force and effect until the earliest to occur of the following events:  (i) an entity or entities other than the Parties enter into a definitive agreement(s) for the compression services; or (ii) April 1, 2002 (the ""Term"").

Dear Joe:
 
As you know, Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC's application for a permit to convert Napoleonville Storage No. 1 to natural gas service is pending before the Injection and Mining Division.  At this point, Bridgeline Storage Company has responded to the Request for Additional Information from your office dated June 21, 2001 and we await your response to see if any further information is needed prior to setting this application for public hearing.
Also, I would like to take this opportunity to confirm our prior conversations concerning dewatering of Napoleonville Storage No. 1.  It is my understanding from our conversations and my review of pertinent regulations that Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC may begin dewatering Napoleonville Storage No. 1 pursuant to the existing work permit to convert the well.  Unless I hear from you to the contrary, Bridgeline Storage Company will begin dewatering Napoleonville Storage No. 1 on August 1, 2001.  Of course, Bridgeline Storage Company will not store natural gas in 
Napoleonville Storage No. 1 until an Order has been issued by the Commissioner of Conservation approving such storage.
Sincerely,
Lawrence J. Hand, Jr.

"Yankee Capacity Transport Structures","David,

I called our Credit Group to look into how large Enron's corporate guaranty is with the Duke pipelines (i.e. TETCO and Algonquin) to make sure that we will pass the credit check that will occur when the capacity is released to us.  Two counter-parties, ENA and ENA Upstream, are set up to do capacity release and other transport deals with Duke with a maximum guaranty of $16 million.  TETCO has ENA down for$1.7 million that has to cover three months of demand charges.  ENA has no other TETCO capacity at the present time, so there should be no problems passing TETCO's automatic credit check during the capacity release process.

Please note that for the two structures we just discussed, the capacity needs to be both recallable and reputtable.  If Yankee and Legal gets comfortable with the other features of the proposed structure, the gas sales price should also include the TETCO commodity cost reimbursement when Yankee calls on the gas and ENA elects to not re-release the capacity back to Yankee.

I will be back on Tuesday.  If you need to get me on Friday or Monday, page me at 1-877-347-3186.

Good luck on your quest,

Ruth

The payment schedule for the net settlement of the PPA Closing Statement and the Executory Contract Termination is different than I communicated to you earlier.

The payment received yesterday from ENA was for September service and was in the amount of $648,000.  I was wrong on the billing mechanics in the exec contract.  Thus, I need ENA to wire $669,600 as soon as possible.  The balance would still be due on Nov. 1.  I just spoke with someone in ENA treasury regarding this payment but at the time I thought yesterday's wire was sufficient.  She was requesting wiring instructions which are below.  I did not get her name.  Can you forward this on to the appropriate treasury person and let me know when they will issue this wire?

Sorry for the confusion.
Thanks.


The wiring instructions are

I forwarded down to you the subject several months ago. We had a conversation a few weeks ago and you advised me it had been forwarded to someone for review. I still have not seen the documents back and have been advised by OGT that we can not nominate gas on that agreement until we return it to them.

Would you be so kind to check on it.

"Schedules to Bridgeline Contribution Agreement","Gerald,
I am researching several outstanding receivables from Bridgeline.  I am looking for the Schedules to Contribution Agreement, which is item 3 in the index of documents.  Do you know where I might obtain a copy?  Also, is there any type of brief available on these contracts.  I have seen one for ECS, so I was hoping that one might be available for Bridgeline.


Thanks for your help.
Karen

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"RE: Dow Lease Amendment","The agreement looks good from our angle - send it and lets see what Dow thinks.

UPDATE: 

I received a call from Gulf South who says that they have completed their deal with Dow to lease caverns #13 and #14, subject to receiving FERC permits.  So, Dow should be willing to let us extend the lease because they will be giving up significant value if we start withdrawing gas.  Gulf South can't buy the gas from us now, because they do not have the proper FERC permits.  We may, however, be able get them to pony up for the lease payment extension (in exchange for us not pulling the gas out of the ground).

Alternatively, Bridgeline is willing to step into our shoes and purchase the gas from us for resale to Gulf South (once GS get their permits) as long as Gulf South provides Bridgeline with a firm purchase commitment at some date in the future (independent of the FERC permitting condition precedent).

Regards,
Brian

Whereas, Seller is desirous of selling, and Buyer is desirous of purchasing, one hundred percent of Seller's interest in the Subject Property.

	Now Therefore, in consideration of the purchase price to be paid by Buyer to Seller and the mutual agreements contained herein, the Parties hereto acknowledge and agree as follows:

	1.	Description of Property.  Seller agrees to sell and Buyer agrees to purchase all of Seller's right, title and interest in the Subject Property. The actual sale of the Subject Property shall be by Cash Sale, containing special warranties, substantially in the form of Exhibit ""B"", attached hereto and incorporated herein for all purposes.

	3.	Not an Option.  This is not an option, but it is an executory contract to buy and sell and it shall be so construed in all respects.  No Party may withdraw from this Agreement all Parties grant unto each other and reserve unto themselves the absolute right to demand specific performance of this Agreement.

	4.	Warranties by Seller.  Seller's interest in and to the Subject Property is and will be transferred to and accepted by Buyer ""AS IS, WHERE IS"" AND IN ITS PRESENT CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR.  BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SELLER HAS NOT MADE, AND SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE CONDITION OR QUALITY OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW NOW OR HEREAFTER IN EFFECT, AND ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. BUYER HAS INSPECTED THE SUBJECT PROPERTY AND HAS SATISFIED ITSELF AS TO THE PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION, BOTH SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE PRESENCE, RELEASE OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES.

	5.		INDEMNITIES.   BUYER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, REIMBURSE AND HOLD SELLER, ITS PARENT AND AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE ""SELLER GROUP"") FREE AND HARMLESS FROM ANY COSTS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES (WHETHER ON ACCOUNT OF PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH OR ON ACCOUNT OR PROPERTY DAMAGE) OR CAUSES OF ACTION AND LOSSES OF WHATSOEVER NATURE (INCLUDING ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COURT COSTS) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR IN ANY WAY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY, ON OR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH COSTS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, CAUSES OF ACTION OR LOSSES ARE DUE TO SELLER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

	6.		Proration of Taxes.    All property, ad valorem and similar taxes applicable to the Subject Property shall be prorated as of the Effective Date between Seller and Buyer. Such proration shall be final and shall not be the subject of adjustment after the final bills are rendered.

In addition, the transfer of the Subject Property or a subsequent change in the use of the property may result in the imposition of an additional tax plus interest as a penalty for the transfer of the change in the use of the land. Buyer acknowledges that there shall be no proration for, and Buyer shall be responsible for, payment of any ""roll back"" taxes or any other redetermination of property taxes assessed or relating to the year of the closing and years preceding the year of closing due or based upon any change in the use of the Subject Property at and after the closing hereunder.

7.		Disputes.   Any dispute relating to this Agreement shall be resolved by binding, self-administered arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (""AAA"") and all such proceedings shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.  A single arbitrator shall be selected under the expedited rules of the AAA.  Only damages allowed pursuant to this Agreement may be awarded and the arbitrator shall have no authority to award consequential, treble, exemplary or punitive damages of any type under any circumstances regardless of whether such damages may be available under Louisiana law. The arbitrator shall have the power to award the remedy of specific performance. The results of such arbitration shall be conclusive and binding, provided, however, that both Parties shall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such equitable relief as is necessary to preserve and enforce their rights under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, either Party may join the other Party to any action, suit or proceeding with respect to which the Party seeking such joinder is a defendant, if the other Party is required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless such defendant in accordance with the terms of the provisions hereof.   Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having a jurisdiction hereof.

8.		Entirety and Severability.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties related to the purchase and sale of the Subject Property.  There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations (whether oral or written) affecting the Subject Property other than those herein expressed.  In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been herein contained.

9.		Governing Law.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED UNDER AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA AND FEDERAL LAW AS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 7 ABOVE.

10.		Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement, and all of the terms and provisions hereof, shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto, and their respective successors and assigns.

No such amendment or modification shall be effected by use of any purchase order, acknowledgment, invoice or other form of either Party and in the event of conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any such form, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

	15.	Waiver.  A waiver by either Party of a breach of any of the terms of this Agreement by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of the terms of this Agreement.  The failure of any Party to insist upon strict performance of any provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right under it shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.

	16.	Termination.  This Agreement shall expire and shall be of no further force or effect Ninety (90) days from the Effective Date unless prior to such time the Parties have entered into an act of Cash Sale transferring the Subject Property from the Seller to the Buyer.

This CA is to cover a proposed transaction for delivered natural gas supply via existing infrastructure to a facility under development by Cogentrix.  I modeled the CA after the Peoples CA.  Let me know if this satisfies ENA's legal needs.

"Master Netting:  A few items to READ","
1.  Should any of your counterparties possibly be a transmitting utility as defined in UCC 9 102, please add a representation in the MNA to determine the issue.  It matters only in respect of where the UCC filing should be made.  The rep will help Cadwalader in its filing processes.   X [is] [is not] a ""transmitting
utility"" within the meaning of Section 9-102(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code.

2.  If you are involved in any master netting agreement wherein the parties include both US and English counterparties, advise Tanya Rohauer, as well as Jay Williams, so that Tanya can coordinate (Paul Simons in London should also be advised). 

3.  London:  Please advise Tanya of all master netting agreements that have been executed and that are currently under negotiation.  In the future, at the commencement of consideration of any new master netting arrangements, please advise Tanya.  

Thank you.

"RE: Napoleonville land","Mary, the last (and only) time I saw these was in a joint meeting with AnnElizabeth and Robert Rose.  Robert actually had these documents, executed and available.  However, the point was raised that one set of the documents was never filed with the courthouse.  If you can get a copy from Robert Rose, you should.  Also, if anyone in legal knows how to check whether they were filed, we should do that as well.
Cheers,
Pat

Dear Patrick:  We are trying to obtain copies of the document whereby Enron Storage Company conveyed the Napoleonville land assets to LRCI, Inc.  They were probably part of the Bridgeline closing documents.  Do you have any documents that support this conveyance?

Please advise.

Subject: Pumping Station Power



Chris,

This will confirm our discussions of today regarding accelerating completion
of electric power to the pumping station.

It is Enron Compression Services' (ECS') desire to accelerate the completion
of the project from the currently projected early May, 2002 completion date
to March 1, 2002.  ECS will agree to pay the acceleration cost.  Our current
""most probable estimate"" of this cost is $630,000, but it could run as much
as $1,060,000 or higher.  ECS would like a guaranteed cap of $1,000,000.
Gulf estimates that the acceleration activities discussed with you will
provide a confidence level of greater than 90% that we can meet the March 1,
2002 date.  Both of us agree that we cannot give any guaranteed date because
of the inherent uncertainties.  Our budget for the line construction
contractor cost is $864,000, including accounting and other standard
overheads.  ECS would pay any amount over that.  Additionally. ECS would pay
$70,000 for accelerating the structure design and Hinsons Crossroads
Substation activities.  ECS would also pay approximately $130,000 to
accelerate acquisition of Right of Way.  We have faxed letters between Gulf
and attorneys for three property owners which shows the difference between
the parties.  ECS would like some assurances that cost is reasonably
minimized within the constraints of meeting the desired schedule.

The details and specifics of the above would be formalized in an agreement
to be signed between the parties.  Both parties acknowledge that time is of
the essence in completing the execution of a suitable agreement, lest the
start of acceleration of the project be delayed to the point that we would
not be able to meet the March 1, 2002 date.  

We also discussed the merits of developing a Memorandum of Intent for the
parties to quickly execute so that some of the acceleration activities can
begin as the agreement is finalized.  This agreement must be completed
within the next few days.

ECS also raised the prospect of two agreements, one to cover the Right of
Way, and another to address the line construction.

We will be faxing to you tomorrow a Gantt chart of a proposed acceleration
schedule.

Regarding the cost breakdown of the line construction cost, the following is
a typical cost by activities:

	Structure Framing and Setting			45%
	Anchors and Guys				10%
	Conductors and Static Wires 			30%
	Grounding					 5%
	Miscellaneous					10%

	TOTAL						100%


This should complete the information you requested.  Please call me if you
need more at this time.  We will provide you a draft of the Memorandum as
soon as possible.

Here is the spreadsheet for September confirms.

The green column is Mcf and the purple column is MMBtu at the wellhead.

Also, on Kennedy we are pricing her Gas Daily gas on a daily basis throughout the month so I guess we'll have to send her confirm after the month is over. (or state that the ""minus number"" is determined on a daily basis)

Let me know if you have any questions.

"Important Message","It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall.  I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.  JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is ""Mission: Possible"" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.  In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer.

Mary, we have received information from Roger Bumgarner at St. Paul/Seaboard that Marsh USA has been appointed agent of record effective June 1, 2001 on the HPL bonds he writes.

As you know, there are three bonds with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and two through Insurance Company of North America.  I presume we will  be receiving notice that Marsh has been appointed on them, also.   However, we have not yet received information to that effect.

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

I don't have the documentation in hand but I can get a copy from the Global Counterparty group if necessary.

"Global Risk Management Operations Organization Announcement","
I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   

Thanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron.

Right now it's manageable and I don't want to have a bunch more templates to have to worry about.  It's easy enough to remember to change those new GTCs we set up now, so we'll just play it by ear.  If too many CPs request these changes that it makes it difficult for us to keep track of, then we'll set up new templates accordingly.

Cyndie,

We get these requests from time to time, so it is not all that uncommon.  We are currently taking this on a CP-by-CP basis and not making any assumptions yet.   Gerald has already agreed that while the default payment date on the GTC states the end of the month, we CAN change the due date to the 25th with the CP's agreement.  Southwestern Energy Services is the CP we have changed already.  You might want to coordinate future changes with Lisa, Mary, Sharon/Susan.   And of course, please keep us all in the loop on any new CP's you need to have changed.

Thanks,

Subject:	Unimark: Faxed comments concerning pymt due date

Per a 11/15/01 fax notice, Unimark wishes the payment dates be ""Payment by wire on the 25th Day"". Referenced deals: 1061122; 1062624; 1063968; 1061089; 1063576; 1146397; 1064010; & 1061084. 

Okay, new kid on the block here:

I'd assume that it is a safe assessment that Unimark would prefer all future payments to be made on the 25th via wire. Lisa, is this something you'd confirm with Unimark (contact per fax is Cheryl Hartsell, phone#: 405-844-6200 ext. 228) or is this something I can do?

Mary, given where we are in the month I know that the payment details have already been established & that given the date that it is too late to process Oct production for payment today.

Stacey/Sharon: Please adjust the payment detail in Global so that the terms flow downstream to Unify for next month's production.

Also; Lisa, Mary, Stacey & Sharon - - - - how common are the requests for payment date adjustments? I'd assume (former life experience) that the larger producers or those who process royalty or related payments require payment on the 25th due to their responsiblities. If this is common - - - instead of repairing after the fact - - - - do we have a list of customers that we should automatically adjust the payment terms within Global & likewise to that of the GTC template?

Gerald - - - - Hi! I'm over here in Confirms now. What is your input on this issue or to that of the common occurrence? Also, as the 'new kid' - - - - are their any future protocols I should know of???


Thanks all!!!!

"RE: Draft email regarding Napoleonville Land Sale","Dear Eva:  Gerald Nemec, Senior Counsel, ENA, suggests the following edits :

Gary,

Per our conversation on July 11, I would like to reiterate that an Enron entity is interested in selling approximately 330 acres of land at the Napoleonville salt dome in Louisiana.  This land is divided into two tracts, one of about 256 acres and the other about 73 acres in size.

Enron recently received $15,000 per acre in a separate land transaction at Napoleonville, and this sets the market price that we expect to receive in the above proposed land sale.  

Does Dow have interest in this land?  Is this price within your range?  If so, I would encourage you to draft a proposal from Dow within the next two weeks, if possible.  

This email does not constitute an offer, but is solely provided for informational purposes.  

Let's discuss this at your earliest convenience.  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last Thursday, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!  

Sincerely, 
Eva Rainer

Mary, 

Below is a draft of the language for the email to Gary Chapman of Dow Chemical, who wanted me to document our request informally so as to start the bidding process within Dow.  If you have revisions, just forward them to me and I will paste them into a clean email to send to him.  Please let me know what you think:

"RE: TXU","The attorney with the most complete knowledge on the Bammel Trust monetization would be Mary Cook, 5-7732.  She covered both legal and regulatory fronts, using outside counsel at Vinson & Elkins and Clark, Thomas and Winters (Austin).  She may be able to tell you who is still here at Enron that covered the Accounting, Treasury, Logistics and other fronts.

As I have taken a job with Enron Industrial Markets, Jeff Hodge will be allocating my work responsibilities to other attorneys who serve Enron Upstream.  Gerald Nemec is currently handling all Compression Services work and some storage matters for Eva Rainer.  Although he's quite busy at present, Jeff may decide that he has the best skill set to assist with a transaction of this type.  While he did not work on the latest Bammel Trust transaction, through his work on the Looper transaction and the various compression projects, he has gained expertise in similar transactional structures.

Good luck,

Steve Van Hooser

Steve,	

One of the major clients we are talking about the base gas monetization is TXU.  We had a meeting with them last week and we are currently in the process of getting them to sign the CA (which was prepared by Mary Ogden).  One the advantages that we have with this transaction is the fact that it is state regulated and also that we have the experience of having done something similar with Bammel.  Now I'm putting together our execution plan and want to learn who worked on the Bammel transaction from the legal and regulatory side, so that we may understand the issues faced then.  I would like to chat with you and get your thoughts on this, please let me know when we could get together.

Thanks

	Gerald,
	Here is the Term Sheet that has been submitted to Oakhill for some time.  

	It should reflect the following:

	7000 hp ( 2 units rated at 3500 hp each)
	Hanover is expected to package, install and finance for ECS under a 10 yr contract
	ECS will basically Lease - Purchase from Hanover

	Hanover will provide all Maintenance for the contract term for a defined cost.  (I'm working the cost with Hanover)
	
	Power provider = Rusk County Electric Cooperative
	Rate structure = special structure whereby RCEC commits to term fixed T&D, fixed Generation and fixed Ancillary Services
		(EES and ENA are basically a no bid on providing the power into SWEPCO & RCEC)

When I made the change, I got the edit that indicates that 8 contracts are still active on the record, and the maintenance group is HOUGAS.  Per Darren, all trades should be under CP ID 55134, i/no/ Constellation Power Source, Inc.  I just want to make sure those can be moved if the record is in a non-trading status.

This is also flagged for EES, should that link and retail flag be added to the Constellation Power Source record, even though it is not known to be one of EES's customers at this time, or at least it hasn't been flagged as such at this time?  I also went in to make that change, but since you are working on those contracts, I wanted to run it by you first.

"Waves of Research...","FROM: Mark Whitney, TheLaw.net Corporation
HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net
REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

     Legal research often comes in waves, but as night follows day, that onerous monthly commitment to West or Lexis is always there. But with so many new options, it doesn't have to be this way.


--VIABLE ALTERNATIVES ABOUND

     True though it may be that your West or Lexis rep is out to put you on that fat annual contract, both companies offer a variety of online alternatives. A person can:

----log in and buy most any document for a few bucks
----Shepardize or Keycite for around $4
----subscribe to KeyCite for $35 a month
----rent a state for a week for $40
----conduct transaction based case law searches only when you have to
----Supreme Court case law from 1790 is now available on the web for FREE
----California state case law from 1934 is now available on the web for FREE
----the landscape continues to change rapidly


--CHOOSE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB

     There can be no question that the commercial value of proprietary legal research resources will continue to drop as more and more primary and secondary materials migrate online. At TheLaw.net Corporation we advocate choosing the right tool for the job. And one of the best single tools you can own these days is our flagship software solution, TheLaw.net Professional Legal Browser.


--LESS THAN $1 A DAY FOR EVERYTHING, UNLIMITED ACCESS

     For just $395 annually for an individual, TheLaw.net gives you a remarkable foundation of primary and secondary resources, on an unlimited use basis, with a national scope, including, but certainly not limited to, the following:

----A great proprietary, searchable case law database that includes the U.S. Supreme Court, the 13 Federal circuits, the 50 state supreme courts and intermediate appellate courts. See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm

----Literally millions of searchable cases, updated four times daily, offered on an unlimited use basis

----Streamlined access to:
------Federal and state statutes, rules and regulations
------the CFR and Federal Register
------executive agency databases and bill trackers
------nearly 1,000 news resources
------another 1,000 reference desk tools
------nearly 10,000 practice area helpers and much, much more
------over 50,000 documents and databases
------all just a fast click or two away on your desktop 24 - 7 - 365


--THELAW.NET MAY OR MAY NOT BE ALL YOU NEED

     Depending on size, practice area and/or jurisdiction, TheLaw.net may well have everything you need. If not, West and Lexis are available online, a la carte for those times when you really need them. As an example, TheLaw.net is not yet a great resource for Federal District Court opinions.

     It all depends on what you want your life to look like. If the convenience and elegance of the gold standard is worth the rates charged by the legal research cartel, you should keep doing what you've been doing and renew that annual contract with Company A or Company B. If not, and you feel like you continue to get hammered at a time when given the efficiencies of computerized distribution of data, prices ought to be dropping, we can help.

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

"Napoleonville Items","Gerald,

There are a number of things that have come up on which I hope to get your assistance, concerning both Dow wells 13 and 14 and the land sale to Texas Brine.

Starting with Dow, I have written a (very rough!) draft reply to Gary Chapman's letter of October 2 regarding a new amendment to the Brine Services Agreement.  
We still would like them to buy the pad gas, but, given the equipment purchases needed if we do have to remove the pad gas, we have to have a concrete deadline for whether they will buy the gas (Dec. 14).  Even so, in talking to Dave Owen it seems to me that the equipment may not be installed for rebrining by the time we exit the wells.  How do we handle that type of delay contractually?  
Dave Owen has told Dow that we are not interested in allowing the fresh water option that Dow suggested in their letter, so I did not even address it here.  I think they understand that we want no part of that. 
Perhaps we can discuss these and other issues after you've read the draft.  

 
As for the Texas Brine land sale, 
Jean has asked me to draw up a timeline to close.  I have spoken to the Texas Brine folks, and unless something goes really wrong with their environmental analysis,  we all expect this to close by the end of November.  The timeline reflects this, but I would like you to take a quick look and see if I am missing anything, as there really are not that many steps.  
TB has not gotten back to us on the draft sale document, but I'm hoping to get it soon.   
There has been a bit of delay as they have requested access to any environmental assessments we have done on the land.  All the channels I have pursued tell me there has never been anything done by Enron (per Kyle Purvis).  If you know anything about this, please let me know!
Do you have a draft of the easement agreement (?) for the March land sale?  I don't have alot of details about location etc, but I think I could find them out if necessary.  Perhaps while we are waiting for a reply on the sale doc we can hammer out the language for the easements on that and on the new land sale.

 
I think that's it for now, have a great weekend and please let me know if you have time to talk early next week.  Thanks!  Eva

The question is, do we need to revise the Master to ENA Upstream too  -  John ?

What's happening with the above deal ? The term is 11/01/01 - 03/31/02, I can see the volume has been changed to 0 - is this only temporarily or has this deal been killed ?
We show this deal as Pending and I wanted to remind you that we have never confirmed this transaction. Please advise.

As we discussed, we need to take the most recent invoice from PB-KBB (the contractor that is responsible for injection of gas into Napoleonville) and have them bifurcate the bill into pre-bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy amounts (using 12/2 as the date of bankruptcy).  In the meantime, please prepare a Cash Use Request Form for the post-bankruptcy amount (Doug Sewell can assist you on this) for consideration by the Cash Committee.  [CHIP PLEASE CONFIRM THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION]

Also, please forward Gerald's draft of new agreement to PB-KBB for their consideration along with any proposed changes to the scope of work description.

We are disappointed to announce that Philippe Bibi, president and CEO of Enron Net Works, has resigned from Enron. Philippe will be joining Putnam Investments in Boston, Mass. as Chief Technology Officer.

Philippe joined Enron in 1995, as Chief Information Officer for Enron Capital & Trading, and has been a key member of the team that built Enron's IT organization, including our numerous successful e-commerce initiatives.  Philippe has been a great asset to Enron and our IT efforts.

For six years, his creativity, intelligence, and focus have benefited the company in many ways.  He will be missed.

Philippe has agreed to make himself available to assist in the transition of his responsibilities.  In the interim, all of the employees who report to Philippe will continue reporting to the Office of the Chairman for Enron Net Works. 

Please join us in thanking Philippe for his  many years of service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

	Here's a revised draft.  Several comments.
	1.  I'm putting together a list of potential arbitrators.  Let's
compare notes next week.
	2.  Subject to getting a better feel for what the damages are, we
would take this case on a contingent fee, blended, or other creative basis
where the fee is tied to the result obtained.  Let us know if that's
something Enron would be interested in discussing.
	3.  If you wish, we can certainly put Tom on the pleadings. Also,
what's your preference re to being named as as counsel on your cases.  (On
cases with Lohse, we usually put both our names on the pleadings.)  Let me
know your preference.

I found out today that ENA did not really negotiate the ICE agreement as it was not contemplated at the time that trading would actually take place on the site.  If it is contemplated that ENA Upstream will actually trade on the site, it is possible we will need to negotiate changes to the forms.  Please let me know if ENA UC intendes to trade.

Donna and Shane,
As I mentioned to you previously, Gerald Nemec will be handling the trading partner agreements upon my departure. His extension is  33512. As has been the practice in the past, Gerald should initial all trading partner agreements and any amendments prior to execution by a VP. I understand that Suzanne Calcagno has initialed some of these agreements without authorization from legal and while I understand she has recently received her law degree and awaits bar results, since she is not part of our legal department we would ask that you continue to abide by the procedures we have set in place to come through our legal department  until such time as Barbara Gray authorizes a different procedure. If you have any questions about that please feel free to contact Barbara Gray at ext. 36832.

Thanks and it has been a pleasure working with you!

Has Kyle Purvis gotten back to you regarding the hazardous waste sources issue?  Hopefully, we can finalize these documents soon.  The guys from Assumption Parish are very anxious to get this deal closed quickly.

FYI...regarding the Sorrento ROWs with Enterprise Products, the money should be transferred this morning and the documents fully executed by this afternoon.  

Talk to you soon,

Keith,  Please revise the document to reflect Item 1 below.  With respect to Item 2, our environmental group is reviewing Enron's use of the property.  No such uses should be found.  What specifically are they looking for with respect to this item.  Finally, any word on the title check with respect to item #3.

Gerald:

    I have been contacted by Kim Torres of the Assumption Parish Police
Jury.  She has some questions and concerns about the Purchase & Sale
Agreement, to wit:

1).  They want to add warranty language to ? 4 as follows:

    Seller warrants that it is the record title owner to the property
being sold, and warrants it has good and merchantable title, free of any
and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
buyer for the same.

    Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that
persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding
authority to do so.

I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor
revisions which I will do.

2).  They are concerned about the warranty language which covers
hazardous wastes in ? 4.  They tell me that they have not done an
environmental inspection of the property.  They want to know if there
have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on
the property.  They are looking for something in writing that no such
sources existed.

3).  Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31,
1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to
Louisiana Resources Co., Inc.  Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc.  I
have not done a title exam so I cannot explain this discrepancy.

4).  She gave me the physical address of the property and the name of
the Police Jury President which I will insert in the documents.

Please contact me to discuss our response to these concerns.

Keith

Enron's Excuses Sound Familiar


Telling us its shady dealings were sanctioned by outside professionals only compounds the error. 

By James J. Cramer 


This article was originally published Oct. 23, 2001. 

	

If you disclose something that is wrong, and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed, and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed, is it therefore right? 

That's what Enron (NYSE: ENE <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ene&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>) is asking us to believe. By telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals, it has simply compounded the error. Next it will tell us that Janus , the largest shareholder, knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises! 

What they are doing at Enron is, well, positively -- here we go -- '80s! In the '80s you had all of these savings-and-loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery. Somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher. 

Nope. 

What it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble. The government ended up going after them, too, for abetting the travesties. 

Enron didn't use taxpayers' money, so the case is arguably not as clear-cut. But the more we probe this Enron, the more we check it out, the more we know it really stinks and that Jeffrey Skilling didn't leave because the stock got hammered, or some other authentic Wall Street gibberish, but because of this nasty, unseemly situation. 

We don't want an SEC probe here. We want a Justice Department probe. This isn't about unclear disclosure. This could end up being about fraud. 

In the meantime, I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10-foot pole. This one's gonna get real nasty before it gets nice. If it ever does.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreements with PSCo and CLF&P","
Gerald,

At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company
such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referenced
Agreements for Public Service Company of Colorado (""PSCo"") and Cheyenne
Light, Fuel and Power (""CLF&P"").  I apologize for the delay.  Our comments
are as follows:

Public Service Company of Colorado Agreement

Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues.  We request in Section
4.1 that the $20,000,000 dollar level be applicable to each of our
companies.  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section
4.6 be $25,000,000 as to each of our companies.

2.4 Confirmations.  In the second line, please change ""may"" to ""shall"".  We
need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for
regulatory purposes.  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that
the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed
and returned, in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 2.21
Transactions.

3.5 Netting and 4.4. Offset.  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in
the normal course of business under these contracts.  Amounts due to and
from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes,
especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize if PSCo
or CLF&P acted as Seller to Enron in a Transaction.  Accordingly, we propose
that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the
parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited
to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering
Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the
Agreement.

4.1 Early Termination.  I am concerned that the date to be established for
termination of Transactions is without definition.  I would prefer to see
the language in subpart (i) modified to state that the Notifying Party may
""establish a date, which shall be not less than two (2) nor more than ten
(10) Business Days following the date of such notice.""

4.2 Triggering Event.  In the 8th line down, I don't understand the
inclusion of the phrase ""or deemed to be repeated"".  Unless I am missing
something, it doesn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.  Please
delete this phrase in the Agreement.

4.1 and 4.5 References to Affiliates.  In numerous places throughout the
Agreements and, in particular, in Sections 4.1 and 4.5, reference is made to
Affiliates.  For regulatory reasons, we cannot intermingle the account
status of our affiliated companies.  Moreover, neither PSCo nor CLF&P is
authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated.
Please delete all references to Affiliates of PSCo or CLF&P in the
respective Agreements.

Article 5. Force Majeure.  The language in this Article is not typical of
most Force Majeure provisions, which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure
for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the
ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period.  The language in
your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time
only, for a duration of up to 60 Days, after which time Force Majeure no
longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement.  In other
words, Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence
involving a separate and independent Transaction.  This is not acceptable.
We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard
Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments.

Section 8.1. Notices.  Prior to the language in the parenthetical, please
insert ""provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically"".

Section 8.2.  Transfer.  We would prefer that this language be revised to
the more traditional language requiring the consent (rather than approval)
of the other Party, ""which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld"".
Please modify this provision accordingly.

Section 8.3.  Limitation of Remedies.  We are in general agreement with this
provision, however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of
merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use.  The gas sold and purchased
under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the
ordinary use to which it is intended.  Please modify this Section
accordingly.

Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions.  The GISB
Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day
confirm deadline, rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition.  We
request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry
standard.

Definition of Material Adverse Change.  This definition needs to be expanded
beyond a review of the level of each company's credit rating.  Please
replace your definition with the following:

	""Material Adverse Change"" with respect to a Party means (i) any
downgrading of any unsecured, long-term senior debt of such Party 	or
any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit
support for the obligations of such Party (each such entity being a
""Credit Support Provider"" for such Party) such that such debt is
rated below ""BBB-"" or its equivalent by Standard & Poors or below
""Baa3"", or its equivalent, by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.; 	provided,
that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	any
unsecured, long-term, senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard &
Poors or Moody's Investor Services, Inc., then a 	Material Adverse
Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which, in the
reasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a material
adverse effect on the creditworthiness, 	financial responsibility, or
ability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider, as applicable, to
perform its obligations in connection 	herewith.

Definition of Replacement Price Differential.  Although we are in general
agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential, it seems
preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable, cost of
cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day
average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred.
Please modify your definition accordingly.

Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power Company Agreement

Our comments with respect to this Agreement are identical to those stated
above regarding the PSCo Agreement, with the following exceptions:

Section 4.2. Triggering Event.  The dollar levels near the end of the
Section should be equivalent between our companies.  Please make each
$75,000,000.

Section 4.7.  Collateral Requirement.  Similarly, the dollar trigger levels
in this provision should be equivalent between our companies.  Please make
each $25,000,000.

Except for the foregoing, please make changes to the Cheyenne Agreement
consistent with our comments to the PSCo Agreement as set forth above.
Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes,
you may contact me via return e-mail or at the phone number listed below.


Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to working with you to
finalize these Agreements.

"RE: Napoleonville Land Sale & Keystone/Unocal Deal","Lisa,

As to Tracts 5A, 4B & 4A, it is my understanding that LRCI is an indirect wholy owned subsidiary of ENA.  Therefore, Enron does have the authority to sell the property and keep 100% of the proceeds.

As to the Keyston/Unocal deal, because Gerald Nemec does all the ENA Compression work, I want to be sure he is involved in drafting/reviewing any such term sheet.

Thanks,

Steve

Subject:	Napoleonville Land Sale & Keystone/Unocal Deal


Steve - I have a few comments and inquiries, as follows:

An update on Tract 5B sale to TX Brine:
Paul Bieniawski spoke to Ann Elizabeth this afternoon and she told him that the law firm, Locklidell (sp.), dropped the ball and failed to file the appropriate papers with the authorities.  The papers should have been filed by now.  How can we confirm the filing? Do you have contacts at Locklidell (sp.)? Can we call the authorities? 

Proposed sale of Tracts 5A, 4B & 4A:
Since LRCI now owns the land as a result of the merger, does Enron have the authority to sale the property and thus keep 100% of any sales proceeds?

Also, I meant to mention to you earlier that I am working on another deal (Keystone/Unocal) which incorporates both compression and storage; Northern Natural Gas is involved as well and we need your help in generating a term sheet.  I will call you tomorrow to discuss further.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

As we discusssed, attached is a marked version of the Participation Agreement which I have marked with some comments.

I also understand the message you left relating to the reluctance of ICE to modify the agreement.  I only ask that you review the attached and let me know your thoughts.

Thanks for the cooperation and time.

Subject: FWD: Warning: Beer Contains Female Hormones

How true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Warning: Beer Contains Female Hormones

Yesterday, scientists for Health Canada suggested that
men should take a look at their beer consumption,
considering the results of a recent analysis that
revealed the presence of female hormones in beer. The
theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into
women.

To test the finding, 100 men were fed 6 pints of beer
each.  It was then observed that 100% of the men
gained weight, talked excessively without making
sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed
to think rationally, argued over nothing,
and refused to apologize when wrong.

No further testing is planned.

Mark - 
Attached is Shonnie's proposed language for triggering the termination of the 4t qtr portion of the executory contract.  We would have this amendment executed and send an invoice to ENA for the 4th qtr payment.  Due to the IPAYIT system we would expect payment to likely be slow.  Can you have G-money review it on your side?
Thanks.  
 
Current thought is to bring forward all of 4th qtr payment through the early termination amendment.  Let me know if this causes you concern.  If you get in a jam, we may be able to find some firm capacity on LC or FU to cover you for the rest of the year (or life of pipe).

"Re: Responses","John,

Sorry, during our telephone conference yesterday I should have been more precise about these documents. I have the technical specifications in fax form but I was not able to send them yesterday. I will have clear originals by FedEx today and will fax them this afternoon and send them by overnight for delivery in your office Friday.

About the GPC/ECS contract, we are trying to determine if GPC has a claim of confidentiality that they believe would prevent ECS from disclosing some or all of the contract without their approval. ECS has no objection to producing the contract and I hope that we can get this resolved quickly.


Enjoy your weekend.

"RE: Participation Agreement w/ENA Upstream","Mark,

Based on your voicemail week before last, ICE is not willing to negotiate the contract, and we will have to execute their contract as is. Have we made anymore progress with getting the ICE contract executed?

Thanks,

Chuck -

As we discusssed, attached is a marked version of the Participation Agreement which I have marked with some comments.  Though I understand that we have existing agreements with ICE that were pretty much unchanged I was not involved in the original discussions relating to these agreements.  I also understand the message you left relating to the reluctance of ICE to modify the agreement.  I only ask that you review the attached and let me know your thoughts.

Thanks for the cooperation and time.

Mark

Gerald,

One more question:  I assume the new keep whole GTCs are primary term.  There is no mention in either the Confirm or the GTC language.  Can you please confirm?   Again, I need something to default to in the template I am setting up.

Thanks,

Subject:	ENA Upstream issues

Gerald,

On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions, the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery.  I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template.  Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts.

I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on.  Are we close to having a final version?  Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

Please get back to me as soon as possible (I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now).  Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

There are two critical issues related to your deal -- one is to get a US court to be able to recognize the arbitration award and two would be in the event that your Mexican counterparty does not have assets in the US, then you would want to next be able to a Mexican court to recognize and enforce  your US court judgment enforcing your arbitration award.

Stephanie,

Regarding the phone conversation we had earlier today, we already have the name of the SPV that will be transporting the gas.  It is called
Compa??a Energ?a de Baja s. de R.L. de C.V.

If the best option is to use the North Baja Pipeline, which is only 4 miles from the plant, we would need a gas price at the tie point of our pipeline (the SPV's) with North Baja's plus the 22 cents per MMBtu that will go to Enron's de Mexico Risk Management Group. 

Gas volumes have changed somewhat under the new scenario.  We are now modeling a bigger turbine that consumes 321 MMBtu's per day, which makes a daily total of 7,704 MMBtus per day.

Matt Duffy and I will call you tomorrow to discuss the next steps.

Judy, the confirm language looks good, but the price is wrong - should be Index less .0175 for the first 1700/d and  Gas Daily flat for gas over that amount each month. We can put a MDQ if you want to...but the only way we would have more gas is if they add another well and we could reject it I think if we wanted to based on it not being w/in the dedication......Do you want to talk more about that?

Please review the attached completed confirmation for EEX E&P and forward to Ellen Wallumrod to send to the customer if you approve.  We need to get this to the customer today if at all possible.

Per Jill Zivley, there is not an MDQ, but she will work with the customer on a monthly basis for volumes above 1700.  Please let me know if we need to adjust the confirm based on that information.

Note that there is no MDQ.  From the printout, it looked as though all volumes in excess of 1700 MMBtu per day were priced as gas daily.  If there is an MDQ, we will need to insert it.  Thanks.

Gerald -

Well, I don't have a monitor or a working phone, but other than that everything is going well in my new group.

Do you have plans this Sunday afternoon/evening?  If not, are you interested in grabbing a few beers or something?  My wife is going out of town on business so I won't have anything to do?.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"Summary of discussion with Gerald","

Scott,

I talked to Gerald after our telecon as you requested ----- here's the summary:

I repeated to Gerald my reply when you asked my opinion regarding the best way to approach Clark.  To reiterate for clarity, I suggest that Scott tell Clark we are not satisfied with BCCK's management of activities related to field construction and construction management activities.  If you (Scott) feel it is appropriate or necessary to offer details, the general reasons are: (1) Poor communication leading to schedule delays and/or cost increases; (2)  A very casual (and consequently unacceptable) approach to improving the overall project schedule as necessary to achieve a 15 December 2001 in-service date; and, (3) Unilateral decision-making by BCCK without the consent of all Crescendo partners having the same effect as (1) above.  As a result, Scott and Ken mutually agree and have directed Dave to take a lead role in completing all construction, testing, commissioning, start-up and related activities.  It is important to stress to Clark, that, while Dave and his delegates have primary authority and responsibility for completing these activities, it will not be done at the exclusion of BCCK.  To the contrary, Crescendo requests and expects BCCK's full and open participation.  

Though the contract does not explicitly address this action, Gerald agreed that since Enron wears the vast majority of all types of risk in this project, it is reasonable for us (Enron) to take action in order to protect our interests.  In addition, Ken Krisa agrees with the need and reasons for making this move, establishing strong support (though not, perhaps, unanimous) at the Crescendo LLC level.  Because the contract does not provide specifically for this action, our options -- in increasing order of severity with regard to impact upon BCCK and the potential for unpleasant reactions by same -- are:

Most Productive, Least Destructive to Project and Relationships:

1.  Take the direct approach to Clark as I described above.

Plan B:

2.  Submit a change order under the appropriate section of the Contract changing BCCK's scope of work and informing them of the change in management philosophy and leadership.

Desperation Tactic:

3.  Declare the agreement in default due to non-performance and take over all activities contemplated by the agreement.

(Gerald --- How did I do???)

Dave

Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.

info. I was doing a volunteer home repair project, so I didn't get to meet
her. But, I'm sure next Saturday I will impress her with my expertise of
the Spanish language (like I impressed the citizens of  Spain, or at least
the people at Joy Enslava!)

How's work? I hope things start working out. Between you, my dad and many
others, a lot of money is being lost. Dad has to exercise 2,000 shares by
end of the year and another 3,000 in January. He's lost over a million
dollars! Hopefully, we can all get together this weekend and drink our
sorrows away!!! After all this time, I'm still waiting to get an offer from
the other side of the company. I think it's around the corner though. Talk
to you soon.

Her name is Lucinda.  Can't remember her husbands name, but I call him
Lucinda's husband.  The number is 713-697-1626.  In case that doesn't work,
her husband's work number is 281-970-2020.  I pay her $50 every time she
comes, which is every two weeks.  She does it all.  Mops, vacuums, dusts,
washes dishes, cleans bathrooms and kitchen, she also washes my clothes,
bed sheets, and towels.   They do speak very little English.  Her husband
speaks better, but they may have you speak with their son, unless you want
to use your Spanish and pretend you are back in Madrid.  Use my name.  If
she has availability, her and her husband will come out to the house and
take a look.  You can go over with her what you want done and then agree on
the price.  I give her a key to my house and she comes when I am not there.
A lot of people I know use her and she is trustworthy.  Feel free to ask if
you have questions.

   Thanks, G. I'll talk to you tomorrow then. Also, let me know what all
   she
   does for you. You pay $50 per cleaning, don't you? Thanks! We will have

   Hey Jen,  The number is at the house.  I will send it to you tomorrow.
   The
   GK was fun.  We went to another similar type place called the Marquis
   II.
   They were both pretty cool.  Kinda of dives.  I was pretty polluted by
   the
   end of the night.  No game this weekend.  We'll have to grab beers
   again.
   Later.

      Gerald, could you give me the name and phone number of the woman who
      cleans
      your house? We're going to hire her if she's available. Sorry we
   didn't
      show up at the GK. Eric was lame and wanted to go home. Was it fun?
   Do

Subject:	Mojave TPA

Shane,  After reviewing the Mojave TPA, I contacted Carlos Pena with El Paso to discuss.  He agreed that Section 3.2(B) can be stricken.  He also agreed that the Sentence In Section & on Page 10 which reads ""Text from here to the end of item 7 has been inserted by Enron North America Corp."" is a note which should be stricken.

Also for consistency sake, Section 3.2(B) in the main body of the agreement should not be stricken.  Exhibit A overrides this Section so the strike is not necessary in the main body of the Agreement.  

Lastly,  the full legal name ""Enron North America Corp."" should be inserted in the agreement.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Looks good to me.  In the signature block, should it be Enron Compression Services Company as opposed to Enron Compression Company?  The information that I have on the ROW tracts is not specifically descriptive other than to describe them as tracts owned by 1) Herbert and Margaret Lane Property, 2) Alan and Elizabeth English Property and 3) Kay Arnold Fritz Property all in dispute along the Shaky Joe Swamp Transmission Line.  The attorney representing these people is Brigham Moore LLP and the representing attorney appears to be Andrew Prince Brigham.  Hopefully, this is good enough.  If you need to talk to me, call me at 701-683-4683 or leave me a voice mail at 3-7350.   When you have a draft of the Construction Cost Overage letter, please send it to me.

Bill,  The contract itself does not have a confidentiality clause, but per
Jeff Stone's email, Gulf does consider the contract proprietary information
and does not want this info voluntarily disclosed at this time.  I
forwarded the email to you earlier.

Concerning the emails etc., as I mentioned before, ECS has a copy of a
Confidentiality Agreement that we executed by Gulf,  initialed by me as ECS
attorney, but not signed by an officer of ECS.  Our business guys think we
executed this agreement.  This CA would cover all information exchanged
between Gulf and ECS.  I have asked Russell Badder's to check with Gulf to
obtain an executed copy.  Nothing in the CA agreements prohibit me from
disclosing the CA. So we could potentially provide the copy of the CA we
have to John.  Obviously the correspondence between ECS and Gulf contains
the commerical terms of our power deal as we negotiated with Gulf.  Given
Jeff's email and the CA copy I have in hand, I would not want to disclose
the emails and memo's without Gulf's explicit permission.  Let me know if
you have any ideas on the best way to approach this with WFLA.

   Where are we in the process of gathering e-mails and other discovery
   that may be responsive to WFLA's request? Also, can I tell John Haswell
   that our contract with Gulf does contain a confidentiality clause? We
   discussed this but I can't remember if we agreed that I could disclose
   it.

Chris,

I spoke with Eric yesterday and he said that you did a great sales job and he wants to try to work with Enron.  He is marketing his gas through John Bower of Natural Gas Associates.  No one here is too impressed with NGA and have visited with them before on behalf of other clients but will meet with John this afternoon to discuss Black Diamond's needs.  From Eric it sounds like they want gas purchases in addition to other physical services.  If that is the case we will bring Mark Whitt's group in on the deal.  I will keep you informed as to the progress.  Mike Legler will likely be taking the lead of this after today.  Thanks for your efforts!  James

Ball prefers that Bridgeline not present any evidence or testimony at
the hearing.  Joe considers the application to be evidence of everything
needed to approve the permit.  Accordingly, I do not intend to present
any evidence at the hearing.  Our role will be to observe any comments

any issues raised at the hearing that require a response and we can
supplement the record in writing.  This approach is preferable because
it does not subject anyone involved with the project to
cross-examination at the hearing and it affords us time to make an

Subject:	Dow Invoice

I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following

1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000
    3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.

Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.

2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40
     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)

Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.

3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500

I find no basis for this in the contract.


Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

I want to personally encourage each of you to think about your colleagues, their contributions to Enron and their adherence to our values.

"FORM CHANGE AGAIN!","See the new versions of the netting agreement forms below.  All that has been done is to move the Force Majeure concept to paragraph 2(a) from 14(b).  This allows the daily limit concept to stand in the UMAs, but it won't elevate to a default under the master netting arrangements.  In certain instances if you want to ""kill"" the day limitation completely in the underlying agreement, you can always use the previous 14(b) language from the emailed docs earlier today.    The docs remain at v1 (version 1).

In the last paragraph, you state ""Enron and El Paso each have a 50% share.""  Which Enron are you talking about?  Enron North America Corp. or Enron Corp.  Just be precise.

Other than that it looks good to me, altough I will obviously defer to our Florida counsel re: the specifics needed to satisfy the other side.

Subject:	Dow Invoice

I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following

1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000
    3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.

Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.

2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40
     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)

Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.

3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500

I find no basis for this in the contract.


Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

"ENA - NNG  Hubbard Transaction - Past Due bill from Midland Power Cooperative","As both of you are well aware, ENA currently owes Midland Power Cooperative (""MPC"") past due amounts for power delivered pursuant to an Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 by and between ENA and MPC, as amended.

I am working with Chip and Dave to determine if we can pay the past due amounts.

Two questions need to be answered ASAP:

1)  Is there any other entity that might be able to supply the power if ENA defaults under its agreement with MPC?  
2)  Is MPC considered a ""utility""?  Dave has learned that ""utilities"" cannot refuse to serve entities in bankruptcy on a going forward basis for failure to pay pre-petition obligations (so long as adequate assurances of future payments are provided).  Gerald, you might need to consult with one of the bankruptcy lawyers to see how this determination is made.  

Please respond at your earliest possible convenience.

Thanks

Stuart

Subject:	RE: Huber Docs

We expect a ruling in the 336 docket to allocate receipt point capacity on El Paso, and that could be done before the end of the year.  BUT, we expect that will be subject of rehearing applications and possibly even court appeal.  And that allocation is likely to be revised if and when the full requirements/capacity problems get addressed in the other dockets in which they are pending.  So, the possibility of revisions to receipt point allocations exist even after an order is issued, and is final and non-appealable in 336.  The language in the draft agreement states that Huber acknowledges that EP's capacity allocation procedures are under review by FERC and that the capacity under contract will be bound by any modifications resulting from any FERC proceeding related to such capacity allocation procedures.  I think this is broad enough to cover all potential FERC actions, as it says ""any"" FERC proceeding.  Since we want to keep it open for future revisions, I would not advise inserting the usual  ""final, non-appealable order"" since you want to be able to track any changes that come along, however they may be themselves changed by a later order.  

Hope this makes sense.

I have also included a clean version without the user notes.  I will distribute a process memo tomorrow.
Please note that even though this does not include margining provisions, the agreement still provides for the reciprocal grant of the security interest in each Group's own payments (see 6 b) and thus, you still need to coordinate with Lech Kalembka at Cadwalader for its perfection.

We are in the process of preparing applications for position limit exemptions for ENA's NYMEX energy commodities futures trading.

Please direct any responses to my paralegal, Tana Jones, via intercompany email or call her at (713) 853-3399 by the end of business on June 15, 2001 if you have any power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any commodity futures account (other than an ENA or other trading affiliate account).

Carlos,

The TRANSCO Precedent Agreement termination date is coming up (August 3, 2001).  Attached, please find drafts of the letter to terminate.  Please provide any comments.

We need to be ready to send in this letter by the end of the week via FedEx if we can not get the Termination Date pushed out one or two months at a minimum.

I spoke with TRANSCO today and they indicated that we should know tomorrow AM if extending the termination date for a couple of months will be possible.

Of course I remember you.  GK is really a great spot on Fridays - Looked
like you guys were having a good time!
I found you quite nice as well, but I am currently dating someone.  No
worries.  While I've never been a big fan of unconventional dating
practices (i.e. hooking up over the internet), i do fancy your approach of
straightforward and clever ingenuity!!  And if you ever want to just have
lunch or a drink anyway, let me know.

Hi Jennifer,  I don't know if you remember, but we met at Gallant Knight
on Friday night.  I was with Mike Robison and the Enron group.  I had
never been there before, but that place is alot of fun.  Definition of
""Swanky"".  You are probably wondering, ""Why is this guy emailing me!""
We'll, I will be straightforward and say that I found you very charming.
I wanted to see if you would be interested in meeting me for lunch or a
drink afterwork!  I apologize in advance if you are dating or involved
with someone, but I thought I would take that chance.

P.S.  Mike gave me your email address, but don't hold it against him.

"RE: Sale of Napoleonville, LA  property  our file ENR-02","Gerald,

There were two changes to be made to the legal description of the property contained on the first page of the agreement as well as in Exhibit B:

1) In the third line, it should read a distance of 49.28' not 49.26'.

2) In the fourth line, the degree symbol is left off the N 51?.  

I will send you through interoffice mail a copy of the survey plat for the land.  Will you or Keith take care of forwarding a copy of the agreement to the police jury for review?

I am attaching the following documents for your review:

1).  Purchase and  Sale Agreement,

2)  Draft of the body of a letter from LRCI to the Police Jury

I have revised the Purchase and Sale Agreement to add the language to
the suggested by Kim Torres (in ? 4) and to add Louisiana Resources,
Inc. and Louisiana Resources, L.P. as intervenors in the Cash Sale to
quitclaim the property to the Police Jury to solve the title problem.

Please contact me upon receipt to discuss and to fill in the blanks.

Whereas, Seller is desirous of selling, and Buyer is desirous of purchasing, one hundred percent of Seller's interest in the Subject Property.

	Now Therefore, in consideration of the purchase price to be paid by Buyer to Seller and the mutual agreements contained herein, the Parties hereto acknowledge and agree as follows:

	1.	Description of Property.  Seller agrees to sell and Buyer agrees to purchase all of Seller's right, title and interest in the Subject Property. The actual sale of the Subject Property shall be by Cash Sale, containing special warranties, substantially in the form of Exhibit ""B"", attached hereto and incorporated herein for all purposes.

	3.	Not an Option.  This is not an option, but it is an executory contract to buy and sell and it shall be so construed in all respects.  No Party may withdraw from this Agreement all Parties grant unto each other and reserve unto themselves the absolute right to demand specific performance of this Agreement.

	4.	Warranties by Seller.  Seller's interest in and to the Subject Property is and will be transferred to and accepted by Buyer ""AS IS, WHERE IS"" AND IN ITS PRESENT CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR.  BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SELLER HAS NOT MADE, AND SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE CONDITION OR QUALITY OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW NOW OR HEREAFTER IN EFFECT, AND ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. BUYER HAS INSPECTED THE SUBJECT PROPERTY AND HAS SATISFIED ITSELF AS TO THE PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION, BOTH SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE PRESENCE, RELEASE OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES.

THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE FACE OF THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AS TO THE SUBJECT PROPERTY.

	Seller warrants that it is the record title owner of the Subject Property, and warrants that it has good and merchantable title, free and clear of any and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against all claims asserted by parties asserting adverse title, liens or encumbrances.

	5.		INDEMNITIES.   BUYER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, REIMBURSE AND HOLD SELLER, ITS PARENT AND AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE ""SELLER GROUP"") FREE AND HARMLESS FROM ANY COSTS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES (WHETHER ON ACCOUNT OF PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH OR ON ACCOUNT OR PROPERTY DAMAGE) OR CAUSES OF ACTION AND LOSSES OF WHATSOEVER NATURE (INCLUDING ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COURT COSTS) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR IN ANY WAY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY, ON OR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH COSTS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, CAUSES OF ACTION OR LOSSES ARE DUE TO SELLER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

	6.		Proration of Taxes.    All property, ad valorem and similar taxes applicable to the Subject Property shall be prorated as of the Effective Date between Seller and Buyer.

In addition, the transfer of the Subject Property or a subsequent change in the use of the property may result in the imposition of an additional tax plus interest as a penalty for the transfer of the change in the use of the land. Buyer acknowledges that there shall be no proration for, and Buyer shall be responsible for, payment of any ""roll back"" taxes or any other redetermination of property taxes assessed or relating to the year of the closing and years preceding the year of closing due or based upon any change in the use of the Subject Property at and after the closing hereunder.

Any dispute relating to this Agreement shall be resolved by binding, self-administered arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (""AAA"") and all such proceedings shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.  A single arbitrator shall be selected under the expedited rules of the AAA.  Only damages allowed pursuant to this Agreement may be awarded and the arbitrator shall have no authority to award consequential, treble, exemplary or punitive damages of any type under any circumstances regardless of whether such damages may be available under Louisiana law. The arbitrator shall have the power to award the remedy of specific performance. The results of such arbitration shall be conclusive and binding, provided, however, that both Parties shall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such equitable relief as is necessary to preserve and enforce their rights under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, either Party may join the other Party to any action, suit or proceeding with respect to which the Party seeking such joinder is a defendant, if the other Party is required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless such defendant in accordance with the terms of the provisions hereof.   Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having a jurisdiction hereof.

8.		Entirety and Severability.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties related to the purchase and sale of the Subject Property.  There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations (whether oral or written) affecting the Subject Property other than those herein expressed.  In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been herein contained.

9.		Governing Law.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED UNDER AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA AND FEDERAL LAW AS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 7 ABOVE.

10.		Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement, and all of the terms and provisions hereof, shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto, and their respective successors and assigns.

11.	Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and need not be signed by more than one of the Parties and all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

	12.	Further Assurances.  Each Party agrees that it will promptly perform all other acts and execute and deliver all other documents as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

	13.	Attorney's Fees.  In the event of the commencement of an arbitration proceeding or a breach of any of the provisions contained herein by either Party, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to collect from the other Party, as part of its damages for said breach, reasonable attorneys' fees associated with enforcing or defending any provision hereof.

	14.	Amendments. This Agreement may be modified or amended only in writing signed by both Parties which expressly refers to this Agreement and states an intention to modify or amend it.  No such amendment or modification shall be effected by use of any purchase order, acknowledgment, invoice or other form of either Party and in the event of conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any such form, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

	15.	Waiver.  A waiver by either Party of a breach of any of the terms of this Agreement by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of the terms of this Agreement.  The failure of any Party to insist upon strict performance of any provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right under it shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.

	16.	Termination.  This Agreement shall expire and shall be of no further force or effect Ninety (90) days from the Effective Date unless prior to such time the Parties have entered into an act of Cash Sale transferring the Subject Property from the Seller to the Buyer.

"Oakhill Power Update","Here is an update on Oakhill power sourcing:

      Wholesale Generation + Ancillaries
?	Electric cooperatives and municipalities are exempt from retail deregulation.  We can not directly contract with AEP or whoever the wholesale generation provider would be because it constitutes a retail sale in a non-deregulated area.  The prevailing utility in the area must be the buyer of the power.
?	Generation + ancillaries will be provided by the chosen entity, through NTEC, and then through Rusk.  The wholesale generation + ancillaries contract will be a three party agreement between AEP (or whoever is chosen), NTEC, and Rusk.
?	Swing - There are consumption penalties for using more or less than the contracted 5.0 MW 7x24 block (meaning there is no free swing).  These penalties are part of the ancillary services, which means that we will not have the exact specifications until Rusk receives the bids on their RFP on 6/27/01.

T&D
?	T&D is provided directly by Rusk County Electric Co-Op.
?	NTEC is charging us $0.20 / MW as an administrative fee (mark up), which is why the fixed T&D cost from Rusk County is $10.20/MW and not $10.00/MW.
?	There will be a minimum T&D charge from Rusk, above which we pay for only what we use:
o	For example:  We pay the minimum charge or actual usage, whichever is higher.

Ricki is constructing the T&D only contract (which he claims will be similar in structure to the previous contract), with the inclusion of T&D pricing and swing.  I also reminded him that he needs to provide the audited financial statements to us.  Attached is a deal diagram with the most current information that we have.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

In a phone call this morning, the Palo Alto City Attorney's office had several comments and suggested revisions to the NGSA.  I have attempted to capture these few comments in the attached draft, which I am forwarding to you despite the fact that only a few pages are implicated (pages 4, 9, 10, 11, and 12, I believe).  We can discuss these changes when you are able to return my phone call. 
Also, can you confirm that PG&E's electronic bulletin board ""Inside Tracc"" is available to anyone with the appropriate software, and that no confidentiality agreements are needed to gain access?  This is what one of the utility folks at Palo Alto tells me. 
Talk to you soon.

	Hotel Room Confirmation








	     Gerald,

	     Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
$129
	rate.
	     Below
	     you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
	matters
	     which
	     one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
	They're both
	     on
	     my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

	     I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
from
	SA.  I
	     estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
	right?)
	     We'll
	     actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
family
	from the
	     Valley will be there as well.

	     If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
at
	the
	     hotel
	     sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
wedding
	together
	     from
	     there.

	     In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
got
	him a
	     gift
	     yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

Jean,  We have appointed three new directors for LRCI, Inc.  They are yourself, Mark Haedicke, and Brian Redmond.  The records show the current directors as Mark Haedicke and Louise Kitchen, but we were unable to find any resolutions supporting this.  We will clean the records up to reflect the new directors.  Since you and Brian are on the management of Bridgeline, it is a more logical fit for you to be directors.  The resolutions for the Napoleonville Land Sale with the new directors are being circulated for signature.  You may have already seen it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Debra,

I started to review the above-referenced GISB sent by you to Jeff Spector on
April 5, 2001, and realized that we already have a GISB in place between
NSP-MN and Enron Capital & Trade Resources.  Is it necessary to prepare
another GISB with the Enron North America entity, or can there be an
assignment of the Enron Capital & Trade Resources Agmt.  Please advise.

In addition, I called you earlier this week and left a message concerning
the Transaction confirmations you recently prepared for Public Service
Company of Colorado and Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power, which utilized the
Enfolio General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement.  Our preference
would be to instead structure these Transactions under GISB Agreements with
each of these utilities.  Please advise if this is acceptable and, if so, I
will prepare GISB Agreements, along with our Special Provisions page, and
send them to you for review.

I look forward to your reply.

p.s.  I will be out of the office during the week of August 12th, but will

Please let me know if there is anything I can do.

Subject:	W&T Offshore and Spinnaker

Gerald,

After talking with Nelson Ferries about two of his counterparties, I have found that the standard Tolerance/Keep Whole language that is now in our ENA Upstream confimation will not cover the negotiated Keep Whole for these counterparties. Nelson has negotiated a Keep Whole arrangement that takes effect whether the counterparty notifies us or not. The tolerance for their swing is 10% and the pricing is based on Gas Daily Mid. 

He has worded the Keep Whole on his deal tickets as follows:

""Volumes deliverd in excess of 10% of the FOM nom shall be prived at the applicable Gas Daily Report, Midpoint price. Volumes delivered below 10% of the FOM nom shall be kept whole at the applicable Gas Daily Mid-point up to the agreed tolerance level of 10%.""

These deals are monthly deals that are done every month and will need this language in them every month.  Please let me know how you would like to handle including of this special language in the confirmations. 

Thanks,
Judy

Ellen,

Based on some additional information from Linder regarding their Pre-pay deal, the confirmations for the August confirmations as well as any confirmations that we prepare through the end of the Pre-payment deal that runs through October will need to be GTC Firm confirmations with modified MDQ language.  Please get with Gerald Nemec if you have questions regarding how to prepare the MDQ language. 

Also, please prepare these confirmations as soon as possible. The pre-pay paperwork must go out to the customer by August 10th; and Stacy Dickson needs the confirmations in order to complete the pre-pay contract.

Thanks,
Judy

I spoke to Joe Ball last week and inquired of the status of our permit
app.  Joe had not heard anything from the legislature.  After I reminded
him that the legislature had a statutory maximum of 15 days to make any
recommendation, Joe stated that he had waited long enough and would
finalize the order and permit and submit it to the commissioner for
signature.  he indicated that we should have a signed order sometime
this week.  I'll keep you both posted.

"Bridgeline - Bankruptcy issues","Chip,

I wanted to follow up regarding the issues that were raised by the cash committee relative to LRCI and our request for approx $300k to pay Dow under our lease on storage caverns #13/#14.

David Zdunkewicz, an A&K bankruptcy lawyer, was asked to consider whether it might be prudent to have the 4 Enron Partners (LRC, LRCI, LGMC, and LGMI) file voluntary petitions in bankruptcy.  The reason to do this would be primarily driven by the flexibility that it would afford the cash committee to fund some of the Enron Partner's liabilities.  It was thought that such a bankruptcy might also have the effect of invalidating the consent right that Texaco currently has on sales of the partnership interests pursuant to the Partnership Agreement.

David indicated, from his firm's preliminary review, that the potential negatives outweigh the possible advantages for the following reasons:

1)  Filing for bankruptcy may result in a claim by Texaco that the partnership agreement is an executory contract and that Texaco could reject any attempt by the Enron Partners to assume the contract.  This would result in a deemed default by the Enron Partners under the Partnership Agreement notwithstanding the absence of any specific default language for a partner's bankruptcy; and 

2)  The rights of Texaco to consent to any transfer of the Enron Partner's partnership interest would not, as previously thought, be invalidated by any bankruptcy.

All of this may be moot as Brian Redmond has secured a preliminary agreement from Bridgeline to pay Dow directly (since they have the obligation to reimburse these amounts anyway).  If that doesn't come to fruition, however, these findings will be important.

"Sale of Napoleonville, LA property,  Our file ENR-02","Gerald:

    I have been contacted by Kim Torres of the Assumption Parish Police
Jury.  She has some questions and concerns about the Purchase & Sale
Agreement, to wit:

1).  They want to add warranty language to ? 4 as follows:

    Seller warrants that it is the record title owner to the property
being sold, and warrants it has good and merchantable title, free of any
and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
buyer for the same.

    Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that
persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding
authority to do so.

I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor
revisions which I will do.

2).  They are concerned about the warranty language which covers
hazardous wastes in ? 4.  They tell me that they have not done an
environmental inspection of the property.  They want to know if there
have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on
the property.  They are looking for something in writing that no such
sources existed.

3).  Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31,
1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to
Louisiana Resources Co., Inc.  Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc.  I
have not done a title exam so I cannot explain this discrepancy.

4).  She gave me the physical address of the property and the name of
the Police Jury President which I will insert in the documents.

Please contact me to discuss our response to these concerns.

Mark,

The agreements you received are to cover the operating lease with the purchase option quoted for this transaction. Hanover will issue the contract whereby Hanover Compression Limited Partnership will be reflected as the Lessor and ECS will be the Lessee. Hanover will then assign the contract to GE whereby all monthly payments will be remitted to GE. Hanover will enter into a separate agreement to cover the maintenance and service portion of this transaction, of which Hanover shall invoice.

The documents forwarded to you are the actual documents you'll be require to execute however they will reflect Hanover as Lessor. Additionally, Hanover maintains all warranty obligations extended against the package regardless of the assignment to GE.

Please review the documents and advise of any exceptions or issues. Keep in mind that these documents are specifically for the monthly operating lease installments and that most of the language is required to comply with the FASB Accounting regs. which keep this transaction as an operating lease/off balance sheet transaction. This is a standard agreement we utilize with other companies seeking operating leases with purchase options while maintaining an off balance sheet transaction.

I'd be glad to visit with you or anyone from your office if necessary to clarify any questions or concerns.



>>> ""Knippa, Mark"" <Mark.Knippa@ENRON.com> 06/22/01 03:52PM >>>

Not sure I get the picture.  ECS is expecting to have an Operating Lease with Hanover that accommodates the new compressor station (equipment, packaging & installation).  ECS is also expecting to enter into a Maintenance Services Agreement with Hanover that covers the provided equipment and installation, bumper to bumper, for the 10 year term of the agreement.

What has been provided is blank documentation from GE Capital that requires maintenance services, delivery, use & operation, insurance, the return of equipment, etc. that does not fit the parameters of our discussions with Hanover.  Is ECS
expected to execute the agreements with GE Capital or with Hanover?  Is the Hanover Agreement expected to mirror this agreement 	less the services that Hanover is being hired to perform?

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Russell, pls set up credit terms for customer for transactions under the physical, which may include pricing amemdments. i.e. the MTM risk may sit under the physical agreement.  

At this time, we are not going to pursue the execution of a deemed ISDA and any price amendments will be handled physicaly. 

Call if there are any questions.

"Revised LIG invoice","Gerald,

I just received a copy of the revised LIG invoice from Bob Walker.  They are now billing Bridgeline for the amount owed.  I am concerned that Bob states in the letter that I provided Bridgeline's costs on their behalf.  

Any thoughts as to what this might open up?
Thanks,
Karen

"Security Bulletin","
The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

"Enron Legal Edge Signon Changes","Dear Legal Edge User,

If you are using the Legal Edge portal, please read this very important message.

We wanted to inform you that changes have been made to access the Enron Legal Edge portal.

What to Expect
When accessing the legal edge portal at http://legaledge.corp.enron.com/tibco/, you will be prompted for a user name and password as usual.  However, the user name has changed. You will no longer log into the portal with your legal edge passwords. Your access will be controlled via the standard Enron network directory. Therefore, effective immediately, you will login using the same user name and password used to login to your local workstation, your CORP ID. 

In addition to the different user name and password, there will be another change. Due to the application upgrade, any personalization you have made to the portal in the past will be lost. As those changes made are associated with your old legal edge portal user name, these personalizations will not automatically be applied to your CORP login. Therefore, do not be alarmed if you do not see all of the content you saw before. Simply, re-configure the portal for your CORP id to see the same content you saw before. Unfortunately, there is no way to get around this issue.

Benefits
- Only one user name password to remember (Use CORP network id and password)
- Not prompted for login for other applications participating in Single Signon
- Once you login once, you will never be required to login again from that workstation (unless you click the logout link)

Effective Date
The Legal Edge portal / Single Signon integration is effective Friday, November 9.

Forward Email to Administrative Staff
Please forward this email to your the administrative staff of your department, so they can access the portal site. Thank you.

Contact Us
If you would like to provide feedback for the Single Sign-On effort, send an email to sso@enron.com. If you have issues or concerns regarding this change, please contact the Resolution Center at ext. 3-1411.


Regards,
The Legal Edge and Single Signon Teams

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals
The EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals team is proud to announce the launch of its new ""Morning Briefing"" report.  The report is aimed at providing traders, mid marketers and originators with a detailed yet concise overview of factors impacting the oil and products markets in the previous 24 hours and how these factors are likely to affect the market in the coming day.  In addition to market moving news items, the report contains key market data such as prices, MMBtu curves, refinery outages, open interest analysis and various other market driving information.  The report is updated by 7.30 a.m. each day and can be found on the Crude and Products Fundamentals intranet at <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/> under In House Analysis, Morning Briefing.

EES Business Center 
The Business Center is ready to receive and track all customer leads and service issues. EES needs a single point of entry for all customer calls and issues to ensure customer satisfaction. Starting today, please route all general inquiry calls to our Business Center to provide each customer with consistent and effective assistance. The number for the Center is 800-337-7827 (800-EES-SVCS) or calls can be transferred to x59390.  You may also contact them through e-mail at EESBusinessCenter@enron.com. 

In the event that an account, partner, utility or vendor's activity affects EES' interests, an URGENT ISSUE request should be filed immediately. Such activity includes change in credit rating, bankruptcy filings, high risk shut-off notices, health and safety concerns, possible litigation, etc. File the relevant information by either phone or e-mail and note it as an URGENT ISSUE to enable the Business Center to act immediately.  

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting
Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. 

Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days:

ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million
EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million
EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000
EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 

If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox.  

We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com. 


IN THE NEWS    

Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8

Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13.

California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand.

``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy
Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented:

- Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, 
- Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry
- All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections.

The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets.

 ""This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000,"" says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron's Cadeo project team.  ""We're pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities.""

GasMarktFax Stirs ""Trouble"" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market
Following on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market:  

European Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October.  The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month's release of Enron's GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers.  ""Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs,"" said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative.  ""However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position.  Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice,"" Helge-Jurgen added.

Enron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland
Enron's Polish team have signed the company's first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement.

The 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland's largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland.

The deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule.

""This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland,"" declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.

""This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland,"" adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron's vice-president and head of the Polish office.  A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible.""

EBS Celebrates Neos Deal
Congratulations to EBS who secured a deal with Neos, a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within London and other UK cities (known as metro connectivity). The transaction gives Enron instant access to London's metro network, which expands Enron's coverage. The agreement involves a  ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity.
 
Marcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: ""We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices.""

Launch of Nordic precipitation index
In another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations.  The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity.  Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers.  The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions.  For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall.  The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden).

On the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region.  

Given the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market.  In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years).  The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.

This is an industrial customer I would like to sell gas to.  The deals will short term Spot transactions.  Can provide the proper clearance for short term trades.

Paul Lucci
(303) 575-6474









Dear Paul,

I spoke to you about setting up a Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement with
Holnam Cement, a direct connect end user on CIG at Portland Colorado.
Portland is located on the Canon City lateral on the CIG Valley Line.
Please verify that you have the ability to deliver gas at this location.
Then, please contact Jim Crain with Holnam to answer any creditworthiness
issues.  Jim can be reached by e-mail or by calling (719) 784-1102.

Please contact me and send any GISB Special Provisions required by Enron.

Holnam's primary fuel is coal.  Holnam will order spot gas on CIG when
starting up or shutting down its coal fuel and, if available, make spot
purchases as confirmed.  In August Holnam will need at least 75,000 Dth.  If
more is required it will be ordered.  Holnam will purchase the gas
""delivered"" at Holnam or as directed by CIG for storage refill.  I will
supply you with the meter identity at Holnam when required.

Please respond immediately.  Thank you.		 Larry Campbell  (303) 239-1361

"Adv: Reduce outside counsel fees, increase in-house expertise","Re:  Dealing with today's uncertain business climate:  How using LRSolutions will help your legal department reduce outside counsel fees, increase legal knowledge and expertise in-house and save countless hours of time for busy in-house attorneys

As you are well aware, legal research and related knowledge activities and products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise. In-house counsel are frequently asked to provide their companies legal advice in a vast array of legal areas.  With corporate downsizing, understaffed legal departments are usually not equipped to deal with the many complex and varied legal issues that are presented on a daily basis.  Time is precious, as well, and in-house attorneys consistently find themselves hard pressed to attack these difficult legal problems with the degree of care required for thorough research and analysis.

Traditionally, corporate counsel respond by utilizing outside law firms for many research and writing projects that could have been done internally if only they possessed the knowledge, resources, and time.  Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of ""reinventing the wheel"", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.  Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing inexperienced, junior associates.  The subsequent learning curve only adds to the enormous costs for corporate counsel.  Because associates lack knowledge in the fields that they research, the total number of hours that they spend tend to be excessive.  With soaring associate rates, the ultimate price for corporate counsel often reaches the upper stratosphere.  At the same time, associates are likely to miss subtle nuances in the law that can be damaging to the client.  In today's economy, it is absolutely essential for companies to reduce outside legal costs while retaining qu!
al!
ity and value.  In addition to saving costs, companies must be able to effectively manage risk in a proactive fashion, in order to avoid potential disaster.

LRSolutions is structured to maximize efficiency, value and quality. Experienced, in-house, partner-level attorneys actively manage all research -related projects, and are always available to discuss your concerns.

missing crucial issues and predict ultimate cost.  Now, for a predetermined, fixed price, you can combine legal expertise with enormous cost savings.  Please see http://www.lrsolutions.com.

Our products and formats are flexible, and include multi-state surveys, detailed research memoranda on specific, complex issues, summations of law, advocacy materials such as appellate briefs and court filings, regulatory handbooks and manuals in every conceivable area of law (enabling your company to better manage risk and raise legal awareness), contract and other document drafting, settlement packages, and listings of relevant authorities.  We will always work with you to determine the format and objective that best suits your needs.  We can work with your outside counsel as part of your overall legal team, or provide an alternative to utilization of outside counsel as well as support for in-house projects.

One question for you in Section 8.  Why did you add the following sentence ""Oakhill would maintain ownership and responsibility for all maintenance of the reciprocating gas compressors throughout the contract term""?  Its not clear to me why we'd include a sentence on gas compression.  Let me know.

"FORM CHANGES:  READ","
1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express language.  

2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns.

See attached reline version to read the changes.

 
3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex.

4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler.

 

The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1 (to use with collateral annex).

Tammy/Shane:

The attached file contains interstate pipelines EES does business on currently.  Once EES is moved to the new environment, we would like to have EDI capability upon launch.

If you could please initiate the TPA's accordingly and begin the testing process.  TPA's should be initiated for Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Enron Energy Marketing, Inc.  (note:  the attached spreadsheet also includes transportation contracts for most of the East Desk pipes; I am working with the desks to obtain the rest of the information needed.)

Please get with Donna if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Lisbet (5-4179)

Does it make sense to try to get together to talk about Bridgeline?  I am not sure if you tried to contact Jean but from what I understand, I suspect that she is not willing to help.  Maybe, we gather everyone else that knows anything about the deal, put them all in a room and extract as much info as possible.  Then, we can try to summarize the state of affairs and recommend various courses of action.  Your thoughts.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

We get these requests from time to time, so it is not all that uncommon.  We are currently taking this on a CP-by-CP basis and not making any assumptions yet.   Gerald has already agreed that while the default payment date on the GTC states the end of the month, we CAN change the due date to the 25th with the CP's agreement.  Southwestern Energy Services is the CP we have changed already.  You might want to coordinate future changes with Lisa, Mary, Sharon/Susan.   And of course, please keep us all in the loop on any new CP's you need to have changed.

Thanks,

Subject:	Unimark: Faxed comments concerning pymt due date

Per a 11/15/01 fax notice, Unimark wishes the payment dates be ""Payment by wire on the 25th Day"". Referenced deals: 1061122; 1062624; 1063968; 1061089; 1063576; 1146397; 1064010; & 1061084. 

Okay, new kid on the block here:

I'd assume that it is a safe assessment that Unimark would prefer all future payments to be made on the 25th via wire. Lisa, is this something you'd confirm with Unimark (contact per fax is Cheryl Hartsell, phone#: 405-844-6200 ext. 228) or is this something I can do?

Mary, given where we are in the month I know that the payment details have already been established & that given the date that it is too late to process Oct production for payment today.

Stacey/Sharon: Please adjust the payment detail in Global so that the terms flow downstream to Unify for next month's production.

Also; Lisa, Mary, Stacey & Sharon - - - - how common are the requests for payment date adjustments? I'd assume (former life experience) that the larger producers or those who process royalty or related payments require payment on the 25th due to their responsiblities. If this is common - - - instead of repairing after the fact - - - - do we have a list of customers that we should automatically adjust the payment terms within Global & likewise to that of the GTC template?

Gerald - - - - Hi! I'm over here in Confirms now. What is your input on this issue or to that of the common occurrence? Also, as the 'new kid' - - - - are their any future protocols I should know of???


Thanks all!!!!

"RE: TWPL Imbalance","Stephanie,
 
Transwestern has been in discussions with ENA since very early December regarding the sale of the Enron Compression Services gas. The ECS off take is supposed to be 11,000 per day. The fact that ECS was not able to nominate their gas has been problematic for Transwestern in that it causes our line pack to be higher than it otherwise would be. When we began discussions, we were open to the idea of getting the full volume out of our system by the end of the month. If a nomination could have been made that resulted in a sale starting at the beginning of this week, ECS could have sold the entire 363,000 in December. At some point, it becomes unrealistic to expect to be able to do that. It has taken ECS so long to arrange for an agent that a now we are looking at selling the entire volume in just 12 days (~30,000/day).
 
I was expecting the following two things from ENA, 1) confirmation from you that ECS was set up to sell their gas, and 2) a start date for a sale with some advanced notice. I would then have conferred with operations to see if it would be possible to move the entire 363,000 in December. I did not expect ENA to arrange the sale before circling back with TW. If I had known that you were about to close a sale, I could have arranged to be pulled out of my meetings Tuesday afternoon.
 
I have advised Patti Sullivan that TW is able to deliver 25,000/d through the end of the month. The balance can be delivered in January.
 
I am confident that things will run smoother in the future.
 
Regards,
 
Paul

Greetings Paul:
 
Eric Boyt advised that TWPL was not in a position to deliver the full volume of approx. 363,000 mmbtu for the remainder of the month for the account of Enron Compression Services.  This would have been good information to know BEFORE we sold the gas.  I left a couple of messages today but never heard from you.  Unfortunately, we have sold this volume, at your repeated request, and are not in a position to retrade the deal. 
 
To the extent TWPL is unable to perform, please call Janie Tholt or Randy Gay to see if they can reduce the commited volume.
 
I am scheduled to be out tomorrow but may have to come in for the afternoon.
 
Please advise ASAP.

Subject:	Summer Intern Program


I am a member of the  Houston Bar Association -- Minority Opportunities in the Legal Profession  Committee.  One of the programs we sponsor is a first-year law student  internship program.   This committee meets with the students at all of  the law schools in Houston and asks them to submit their resumes.  We then  provide copies of the resumes to prospective employers for review.  The  employer then selects the students they would like to interview.   
 
Some employers have  the students participate in their permanent hiring programs.  Others  provide this simply as a learning experience for the students.  The  employer determines the length of the internship and the compensation.  Six  weeks is a common period.  This is a great program which has provided  valuable experience to a large number of students for many years.  If your  organization would be interested in participating in this program, or if you  would like more information, please e-mail me or call me.  I appreciate  your consideration of this matter.   (Please feel free to forward this  e-mail to the appropriate person(s) in your organization.)

Jeff, 

I will be meeting with the Texas land office on Thursday morning and would like to send them the attached tomorrow for their review prior to the meeting.  The attached is a Letter of Understanding (drafted by me based on your prior letter of understanding).  It is specific to the Kathleen Ann storage field and includes the current owner of the field as a third party to the letter. 

If at all possible, I would like you (or your designee) to review, modify and resend to me so that I can send it to the land office tomorrow.

Thanks,

Barry,

My name is Alisha Mahabir and I have been working on negotiating the MGI/ENA GISB.  I have been in contact with Lourdes Cervantes at MGI; her phone number is 525-232-5990.  There are still a few issues left to be resolved before we can proceed with the execution of this document.  Per Geral Nemec's request, I will outline these changes as they are addressed in Exhibit B to the GISB that was sent over by Lourdes.

Initially I want to note that some changes must be made to the front page of the GISB.  MGI has previously agreed to allow ENA to be the confirming party under Section 2.5.  Additionally, there have been a few problems with allowing payment to be made on the 30th day of the month.  It appears that MGI has been construing this provision broadly so as to make payment on the 2nd day of March after a short month in February.  Thus, we would like Section 7.2 to read ""30th day or, for the Month of February, on the last day of the Month"".  

As for Exhibit B, the changes are as follows:

#4 The words ""or interruptible"" should be deleted from this provision.  The interruptible language conflicts with the ability to do 30 day firm deals under this contract.

#11 This provision deals with when notices are deemed received.  The provision as written provides that notice by first class mail is deemed received 2 business days after mailing.  MGI would like to change this to allow for receipt to mean actual receipt.  Lourdes told me that she will check to see whether the change can be stricken or at least to extend 2 business days to 3 business days.

#12 (a) MGI has agreed to strike the term ""letter"" from the requirement that the Parent issue a guarantee should doubt arise as to Enron's ability to pay.  
      (b)  Originally the GISB provides that a contract can be terminated without prior notice should certain conditions be met.  MGI wants to change this to require the parties to provide 48 hours notice.  Lourdes told me that she would check to see whether this could be changed to 24 hours prior notice.

#16  The language designating ICC is acceptable, however any redundant language should be stricken.

If this memo is at all unclear, please feel free to call me.  My extension is 52722.

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

Scope:  

The scope of this project is to analyze, develop and propose a compression services package that will optimally manage Encore's current and future horsepower requirements.  In order to do this we will need to explain our financial structures and gain access to information pertaining to their compression facilities and existing power agreements. 

Email me with the completed CA so that I can forward it on to the client.

"Aruba update","Ok - so here is the latest on Aruba.  We have decided to go through Continental vacations instead of fun jet for 2 reasons.  One, direct flights on Continental to Aruba and two, it is slightly less expensive.  Dates have changed slightly.  We are leaving at 1:30 on Tuesday, Oct. 16 (arrive at 7 ish) and return on Saturday the 20th st 3:30ish.  

If you guys are interested you could do either, wed thru sun on fun jet or tues thru sat on continental vacations.  Dee Espinoza at TAP booked us.  And with either trip, you can cancel up to 24 hours in advance without penalty.

Let me know if you have any questions

Nothing real exciting.  After Thursday, I was a little burnt so I stayed
home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends house.  He plays
the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session (or at least
we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday I went
furniture shopping and purchased a couch for my house.  I got kinda of sick
of have no furniture in my living room. Now my house won't seem so pathetic
when people visit.

Yea, I have been to Teala's.  Can't say I have ever had the mango margarita
though.  I will have to try when I get a chance.  Sounds fruity!!

  ANR's tpa with  ENA, ENA Upstream, Enron MW and enovate does not have the language either.  i.e 3.2b omission.  Charlie at ANR wants the EEs tpas to be identical.
So should I leave it out? Again:  these  companies are all owned by El Paso?

Shane,  As we discussed, we can remove the strike of 3.2(b) in the Tennessee TPAs.  I put in a call to Mojave to discuss this issue with them.  After my conversation with them we can decide how to proceed.  All other TPAs should be sent out with our typical language.

Subject:	tpa - Section 7 issue

    

      Donna Greif has asked me to initiate tpas with about 20 to 22 pipes for the two EES companies.   I am sure that Tennessee and  EPNG will again
      raise the same issue as they did with the language in Section 7 when we initiated tpas for ENA and  ENA Upstream.  
      In order to maintain consistency, should I remove the line referencing the 3.2B omission?

      The tpa between EPNG and ENA does not have this line item.
      The tpa between Tennessee and ENA as well as between Tennessee and ENA Upstream does not have this either.
      
      Mojave also has the same issue with this, they are refusing to sign the tpa with us for ENA.

      These are all EL Paso owned pipes.

      I have already contacted someone at Tennessee, and they want the exact same language as the previous tp agreements.
      

    Thanks

Dear Fellow Diver;

Wow!  Since being mentioned in last months Fellow Diver newsletter, hundreds of you have downloaded PADI's  ""Bring A Friend"" offer from PADI ( http://www.padi.com/promo/poker/download.asp ) that pays you $50.00 just for getting three new people certified as PADI Open Water divers. I have also received hundreds of questions, so I thought I'd take a minute to answer the most frequently asked ones.  Here they are:

What's the catch?

There is none.  Honest. Just download the form and for every three divers you bring into a PADI Dive Center or Resort location who complete the PADI Open Water Diver course by February 28, 2002, I send you $50.00.  That's it!

If I get 6 people certified can I get $100.00?

Yes, just make copies of the form, and for every 3 new PADI Divers your bring in by February 28, 2002, I will send you $50.00.

Why is PADI doing this?

Actually, that's pretty simple to answer. PADI is trying to get more divers into the sport. It's not a secret that the dive industry's growth in the US has been flat over the last couple of years, so we're trying to ""kick start"" the industry with an outrageous offer. (See, I told you there wasn't a catch!)

I heard that some PADI facilities are offering additional incentives if I show them a copy of my PADI check. Are there other offers for getting new divers?

This is the best part of this whole program.  Within hours of PADI announcing the launch of this program,  we received inquiries from PADI Members and others in the industry who wanted to add additional incentives on top of the $50.00. The results have been amazing. Several dozen PADI Retailers have called or emailed to tell me about  their offers. These include:

Ocean Enterprises, CA; Ocean Divers, FL; Deep Six, FL; Bird's Underwater, FL; Ocean Odyssey, WA; A-1 Scuba, CO; Ocean Concepts, HI; Mass Diving, MA; Poseidon Adventures, DE; Annapolis Scuba, MD; Sport Chalet, CA; Divers Market, MA; Blue Horizons, PA; Aquatic Adventures, WI; Sea Side Dive, MI;  Blue Ocean, NY; Underwater Phantasea, CO; Underwater Connection, CO; Weavers Dive & Travel, Boulder, CO; Ocean's Window, TX; The Dive Spot, TX; A.K.A Diver, Arlington, TX;  El Mar Diving,  AZ; All Wet Scuba, AZ;, The Reef Diving Co., AZ;, We B Divin', TX;, Grapevine Scuba, TX; Hampton Dive Center, NY; and Aquatic Adventures, NY.

More PADI Dive Centers and Resorts are calling daily, so I apologize to those I've missed or inadvertently left off the list above.

Manufacturers have also stepped up to the plate and are in discussions with PADI to bring you more for your effort.  Scubapro immediately said it will issue a $25.00 rebate on Scubapro Twin Jet Fins to anyone who can show a copy of their $50.00 check from PADI as well as proof of purchase.  For details, please visit http://www.scubapro.com.

PADI resorts are stepping up to the plate, too.  Sunset House in Cayman is offering 10 percent off for anyone who shows a copy of their $50.00 check from PADI and books a stay there before March 1, 2002.  UNEXSO in the Bahamas has a $150.00 dollar offer for showing the PADI check and an additional $50.00 for every ""Learn To Dive"" customer you bring them.  For details on these offers go to  http://www.sunsethouse.com/ and  http://www.unexso.com.

I know you all hate long e-mails, but this has been truly incredible and there is still more good news coming.  Both Sport Diver magazine (http://www.sportdiver.com)  and Skin Diver magazine are working on additional incentives that I'm sure I'll be able to announce very soon. I also understand Seapro in Florida also has a program under development.

So, it's not just $50.00 anymore! Do this right and you can earn a heck of a lot more -- you ain't seen nothing yet.  So, what are you waiting for? Get three friends and go diving!

"RE: Enfolio agreement - CSU","Afternoon,
    I was able to go through Colorado Springs financials, but was unable to distinguish between natural gas system operations and the general ""utility"", outside of book value of the various gas, electric and water plants.  As such, if we are unable to acquire statements for the gas system itself, I don't think we can agree to CSU's redline of Scope of Agreement (point # 1 below).

Subject: RE: Enfolio agreement


Max,  The agreement calls for them to provide to ENA certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ENA under this agreement.  A letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient.  To the extent they don't provide this, an Early Termination event occurs.  We can still call for collateral in accordance with Section 4.5 if they don't meet the thresholds.  The item added in your Sentence #1 below does concern me.  This seems to be a floated revenue system and I am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there.  I need to review these additions with Colorado Springs, because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements.  We probably need to get on a conference call with them.
 
I am probably OK with the arbitration provision, depending on how the other items turn out.
 
Tyrell,  do you want to set something up a call with Marcus and his attorney to discuss these issues?

A couple of thoughts regarding the redline:
 
1) Scope of Agreement: ..""judgement resulting from this Agreement shall be made only from the revenues received from Customer's natural gas system operations..""  I need to re-review the financials to determine how much the gas system operations is worth.  Because of this clause, $15mm in credit may be too much.  Once I can get on the net, I'll review.
 
2) Scope of Agreement:  ""Furthermore, in accordance with the Colorado Springs City Charter, performance of Customer's obligations.....expressly subject to appropriation of funds for such purpose by the City Council.""  In case we are in a position to call for margin, what is the process of getting it?  Do they have to get permission / authorization from the city, etc..? Tyrell had asked me the process how we call and what we accept for margin, but I'd like to understand the ease and/or difficulty of receiving margin from them.  We may never hit the threshold, but if we do and we can't get margin, we may have a big problem.  
 
3) Gerald, I assume you're ok with the arbitration clauses?  
 
Give me a call if anyone wants to discuss further.

Volunteers Needed to Help With a New Project
Junior Judges

Junior Judges:  Helping Kids Make Smart Choicesis a public service project implemented through a curriculum and an accompanying video, hosted by two teenagers, that depicts elementary school aged students faced with challenging decisions.  The project includes seven units and addresses the subjects that affect the lives of the target audience, fourth grade students, including: cheating, destroying property, bullying, teasing, stealing, gangs/weapons, and drugs/alcohol.  Each unit in the curriculum is self-contained so that an educator may use one, all, or just a few of the units, depending on his or her preference and time.  Attorney involvement will include explaining the importance and necessity of laws and rules in society, and moderating the topic discussions following all or some of the video segments.  
Please contact Kent Altsuler at kaltsuler@jw.com if you are interested in volunteering.
 

Volunteers Needed to Help
ADOPT AN ANGEL

For over ten years, the Adopt-an-Angel Program has provided a healthy dose of holiday cheer to over 500 underprivileged students who attend Grimes Elementary School. Children who otherwise would probably not receive gifts during the holidays are presented with clothing and toys donated by Houston lawyers and their staffs. Adopt-an-Angel committee members spend countless hours during a busy time of the year coordinating this impressive endeavor.
Each year, committee members ask every student at Grimes to fill out a ""wish list."" Although toys are always a favorite, most of the children also list basic clothing items (like socks and underwear) and school supplies. As soon as the committee members receive the lists from the school, they distribute them to attorneys and their staffs who purchase the items and wrap them for delivery. A few days before the students begin their holiday break, the committee members, with the assistance of Santa Claus, deliver the gifts to the children. The children are always delighted by this annual visit. 
In recent years, the Adopt-an-Angel program has been so successful that resources have been used to provide holiday meals and extra clothing to families in particular need, to purchase school uniforms for almost 100 students, and to assist with gifts to a local foster care facility.
Please contact Kristin Tassin at kristin@drylaw.com if you are interested in helping.

"Enfolio confirms sent for PSCo and CLF&P","Gerald,

This will confirm our telephone conversation of today's date.  As I
explained by phone, we are trying to obtain consistency of our Gas Supply
Agreements between the various operating subsidiaries of Xcel Energy Inc.,
including Cheyenne Light Fuel & Power and Public Service Company of
Colorado.  Currently, a GISB Style Agreement is in place between Enron
companies and each of the Northern States Power companies (MN and WI).
Enron has also executed a Spot Gas Purchase Agreement with Southwestern
Public Service Company, another operating subsidiary.  Each of these
agreements contain more detailed provisions to describe the agreement of the
parties than the Enfolio Firm General Terms and Conditions furnished for our
review.

In particular, our concerns with the Enfolio General Terms and Conditions
(""GTC"") include, but are not limited to, the following:

1.  Unlike the GISB style Agreement, the GTC contains no provisions to deal
with the possibility that a price will not be published for a particular
geographic location on any given day, except with respect to Default
situations under paragraph 2.  The GISB Agreement addresses that possibility
by incorporating the idea of using an average of previous day-next
succeeding day publication pricing in the event no published price is
available for the relevant gas day.

2.  The GTC includes netting of payments due from one party to another.
That is problematic for us from a regulatory perspective, as payment streams
for purchases made by the utility are passed through without markup to our
ratepayers, while accounting methods for any sales of gas by the utility
receive different treatment.  Neither the NSP GISBs nor the SPS Spot Gas
Purchase Agreement referred to above contain such netting provisions.

3.  The Force Majeure provisions under the GTC are not nearly as detailed as
those in our existing NSP and SPS agreements.

4.  The GTC has no written provisions for audit rights.  It appear to me
that the only contractual methodology for obtaining this information would
be through discovery in arbitration proceedings.  In contrast, our
agreements with Enron for the other operating utilities have written audit
provisions included therein.

5.  There are certain other provisions which we need to include in our
agreement (i.e. firm transactions, as opposed to interruptible delivery,
compliance with affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions,
disclosure to regulatory bodies of contractual provisions, with request for
protective order regarding pricing, etc.). With the exception of firmness of
the transactions, the GTC does not seem as amenable to modification through
the inclusion of Special Provisions or amendments, as does the GISB to
address these concerns.

We understand that GISB, as originally crafted, does not deal with
transactions of longer than one month, however we believe the inclusion of
Special Provisions to negate that language, together with the inclusion of
""Early Termination"" type provisions to address Enron's concerns upon the
occurrence of a ""Triggering Event"" would meet Enron's needs.  Alternatively,
we are willing to consider any alternative language that you may propose,
keeping in mind our desire to move toward more consistency of the agreements
between our various operating companies.

Please let me have your thoughts.  We would like to get signed agreements in
place prior to commencement of the Delivery Period.  As always, I look
forward to working with you to achieve that result.

Alan Bransgrove

Can we get the language added to cover the payment due date if it falls on a holiday or weekend?  Per our discussion on 09/26/01, I have set the default in Global Contracts as next following business day, but it's not in writing either in the GTC or the confirmation language.

The last day of the month should be used as the default. We are only changing this date when counterparties have been settling with ENA on a different date.

Gerald,

On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions, the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery.  I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template.  Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts.

I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on.  Are we close to having a final version?  Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

Please get back to me as soon as possible (I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now).  Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

Paul,
Have you heard anything from Gerald?  We need to get these contracts signed.
I am having problems reconciling with Thersa's invoices.  I have paid the
amount reflected on the invoices even through I did not agree for April,
May, June, and July.  I short paid the August invoice.  This is not a good
situation to be in without a contract.  I am not sure where Greeley and
Enron stand with each other especially in light of the difficulties I am
having reconciling the invoices.  
I do not want either party(Greeley or Enron) to find themselves in a
situation that would end up in arbitration.  Talking on the phone or
exchanging worksheets has not proved to be the most efficient way to settle
these differences.  Do you have any sugestions on how we can get the
contracts executed and the invoices reconciled before the deal terminates at
the end of October?   


Thanks...Robert

sale of Louisiana Resources' assets (including licenses) to Bridgeline .  As
I mentioned, what is important to our inquiry is whether transfer of
applications were filed prior to the consummation of the above transaction
whereby the assets of Louisiana Resources' were acquired.  I will need the
following transaction information:

*	When did the transaction close?  The exact date. 2/?/2000
*	Which licenses where part of that transaction?
*	Which licenses were obtained by filing a new application after the
transaction date?
*	Which stations are constructed/operating?

As a reminder, we are under a deadline to get this information to the FCC.
To make the deadline I will need the information by tomorrow or Monday at
the latest.  Please call/email with any questions.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.

Subject:	RE: Dow Lease Amendment 

The agreement looks good from our angle - send it and lets see what Dow thinks.

UPDATE: 

I received a call from Gulf South who says that they have completed their deal with Dow to lease caverns #13 and #14, subject to receiving FERC permits.  So, Dow should be willing to let us extend the lease because they will be giving up significant value if we start withdrawing gas.  Gulf South can't buy the gas from us now, because they do not have the proper FERC permits.  We may, however, be able get them to pony up for the lease payment extension (in exchange for us not pulling the gas out of the ground).

Alternatively, Bridgeline is willing to step into our shoes and purchase the gas from us for resale to Gulf South (once GS get their permits) as long as Gulf South provides Bridgeline with a firm purchase commitment at some date in the future (independent of the FERC permitting condition precedent).

Regards,
Brian

Subject:	Hubbard Transaction


	I've completed a review of the ENA Hubbard transaction that provides Compression Services to NNG.  
	Note that this is contracted as ENA and not ECS.  Gerald communicated that the previous agreement
	with Hubbard was executed as an ENA contract or assigned from ECT to ENA.  

	My short term objective is to gather and submit the required information to the Corp. Cash Management
	committee and get the delinquent power bills paid and brought up to date.  Currently we have Oct. and
	Nov. bills form Midland Power Cooperative & I've confirmed that ENA/ECS has received payments for
	Oct. from NNG that account for $64,508 (Annual Charge) and $37,493 (electrical on-peak billing I assume)
	for a total of $102,001.99.  

	I gathered up the cash flow projections for the project and provided a summary version to Stuart.  Oct. business
	projected a monthly load equivalent to an $81,000 electric bill versus the $90,148 actual.  He wants us to pull
	actual billing for the months beginning with this contract term (July 1, 2000) through November 2001 and 
	represent actual income to date and projection income from that point.  

	I'll expect that we will need the same process for the TW transactions at Gallup, Bisti and Bloomfield to 
	get these bills paid despite the LLC structure that houses the accrual business.  I was under the 
	impression that this information, billing and reimbursements was being tracked by first Carol Carter and
	then her predecessors.  I helped set up excel files that they updated monthly for both power billing and
	gas nominations to satisfy the contract specifics.  This would house all the information that is being 
	requested.  

	I also noticed that I was not seeing the scheduled monthly Maintenance payments being made to NNG.
	The contract also defines that ENA is paying NNG $320,000 annually at the end of July for the on-peak
	power charges from Midland Power.

   not a good idea to start at GK at 6  and stay til 2 in the morning.

   Thanks for your gracious response.  Let me tell you, I had much debate

   was
   swung in favor of email to save myself the potential awkwardness of the

   on Friday""
        Jennifer:  ""Who?""

   As I said Friday night was kind of hazy for me.  I'll probably be
   meeting
   some friends for happy hour on Thursday night at Downing Street.  If you
   and your friends are out, why don't you try and stop by.

1.  Our lawyers in Louisiana are going to send someone this week to check the Assumption Parish records (to see what was actually recorded);

2.  Mary sent an e-mail to a former Enron Landman (now AEP), Robert Rose.  Ann Elizabeth told Mary that Robert may have a copy of the document(s).

Mary, 

Would you call AEW and find out where we can find a copy of the Tract 5B sale from Enron Storage Company to LRCI, Inc. here in our office--I know you are planning to call Sandi Braband; according to the message below, AEW must have done the work.

Also, would you please call Keith Daigle (I don't want to use Locke Lidell on this) and ask him to obtain a file stamped copy of ""all"" ESC conveyances to LRCI that are filed in the Assumption Parish Records.  Keith's phone number is 504-830-3990 or 985-898-1909.

Would you also ask Keith how he is coming on the Sorrento Right of Way Agreement that I sent him on July 7.  We need to have that back by the time Patrick Johnson returns next Monday.  Please give him a ""gentle"" prod. 

Thanks, 

Steve

Steve - I have a few comments and inquiries, as follows: 

An update on Tract 5B sale to TX Brine: 

Paul Bieniawski spoke to Ann Elizabeth this afternoon and she told him that the law firm, Locklidell (sp.), dropped the ball and failed to file the appropriate papers with the authorities.  The papers should have been filed by now.  How can we confirm the filing? Do you have contacts at Locklidell (sp.)? Can we call the authorities? 


Proposed sale of Tracts 5A, 4B & 4A: 

Since LRCI now owns the land as a result of the merger, does Enron have the authority to sale the property and thus keep 100% of any sales proceeds? 


Also, I meant to mention to you earlier that I am working on another deal (Keystone/Unocal) which incorporates both compression and storage; Northern Natural Gas is involved as well and we need your help in generating a term sheet.  I will call you tomorrow to discuss further.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

"Gas on Gas ompression Deal","As we breifly, ECS is developing a product for gas driven (as opposed to electric driven) horse power.  Essentially, the value proposition involves ""wrapping"" an existing gas horspower station with a Compression Service Agreement and allowing the Pipeline to pay for the shaft horspower in commodities other than (or solely in) cash.  ECS provides shaft horsepower (meaning that we bring gas, as opposed to elecricity) to the compressor.  Because Shippers would continue to pay for its fuel per the existing tariff, the Pipeline would utilize shipper fuel to pay for shaft horsepower.  This structure represents an avenue for the Pipeline to hedge the value of the molecules it collects from Shippers or simply to levelize their fuel burn.  Timing and basis differences could, presumably, be included to increase the value to the Pipeline and potentially passed through to the Shippers.  

Attached is a deal example that I recently presented to Great Lakes Gas Transmission that solves a fuel levelization problem they have on their system....they overcollect in the Winter and undercollect in the Summer.  It may be of some use in reviewing to help ascertain answers to the following:

1)	Would a gas compression service deal be required to be filed by the FERC?  My sence is that the answer is no. This is simply an O&M service
	contract and lease agreement.
2)	If a Pipeline is on an annual gas tracker, what would be the tracker implication?  It should be flat, as technically, ECS has not changed the
	amount of fuel collected/utilized....we have only provided optionality as to hedgeing???


Please give me a call to discuss.

Thanks

Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:

     1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000.
     2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are
currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.
     3.  I don't know.  I don't think that any of the licenses were new
after the transaction date.  Robert, any different info?
     4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you
forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.
Do you agree, Robert?

To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They
were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's
40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these
licenses has been filed.

Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the
licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into
Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  LRC is still held 100% by Enron North America
Corp.

   Gerald, this is just to follow up on our prior phone conversations re:
   the
   sale of Louisiana Resources' assets (including licenses) to Bridgeline .
   As
   I mentioned, what is important to our inquiry is whether transfer of
   applications were filed prior to the consummation of the above
   transaction
   whereby the assets of Louisiana Resources' were acquired.  I will need
   the
   following transaction information:

   *  When did the transaction close?  The exact date. 2/?/2000
   *  Which licenses where part of that transaction?
   *  Which licenses were obtained by filing a new application after the
   transaction date?
   *  Which stations are constructed/operating?

   As a reminder, we are under a deadline to get this information to the
   FCC.
   To make the deadline I will need the information by tomorrow or Monday
   at
   the latest.  Please call/email with any questions.

   Thanks and have a Happy Thanksgiving.

"Title Search contact","Gerald,

The name of the guy in Lafayette, LA who can do a title search for us if we need him to is Art LeBlanc, (337) 233-9099.  However you would like to handle it is fine with me. 

Like I mentioned on the phone, Roger Westbrook is the one helping with the ROWs that Bridgeline is requesting on the Crawfish land.  He indicated some time back that he had received some of the drawings from Bridgeline.  If needed, I can set up a meeting with Roger once we know the status of the documents.  

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help on either of these.

Thanks,

Rakhi

In our last general Wellhead Book meeting, we discussed general processes to be followed for larger gas deals going into the wellhead book.

Attached is the revised process check list for both VPP/Prepay transaction and long-term physical purchase transactions.  I have also attached a document outlining the procedures to get a new entity set up in Global Counterparty.

Please review and provide feedback/comments by Thursday, July 12, close of business.

Chris,
Wanted to let you know that the investment in Kachine/Gallup is $1,775,144.85, not $1,742,855.41.  This will reduce the net gain to $324,158.15.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Karen,

Per our discussion, you will find attached the letter that Jean is going to sign.  According to the numbers showed to me by Carol earlier this week, we should expect to book a gain of $356,447.59 as a result of doing this (calculations below).  Please review and let me know if you have any comments.  I will deliver you the signed letter when I get it along with the detailed calculations.

Subject:	Notice Letter for ECC

Attached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO, LLC for ECS' election to take and make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup and Kachina.  As we discussed Chris, Section 5.03 of the LLC Agreement governs the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and upon provision of this notice, the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS.  Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is, the original notes will need to be cancelled.  Nora, can locate these originals.

I am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct.  I pulled these from the agreement.  Need to verify.

OK folks, here's an update on Holcomb Oil and Gas Inc./Key Gas Holding, LLC.  The only active contract we have in place with Holcomb is an Enfolio II Spot and the interest assignment letter sent by Holcomb does not cover an agreement so broad.  I spoke with Susan Herrera at Holcomb [(505) 326-0550] and asked her to send an assignment letter.  She didn't seem to really understand what I needed to I also gave her Gerald's number in Legal.

Once we receive a good assignment, I will request that the Global Counterparty group set up the CP.  Sharon will process the assignment at that point.  Depending on whether we want to split deal 901255 or repath will depend on how long this process takes.  I will keep everyone informed in the meantime.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kelli,

I'm not sure who normally submits request to the Global Counterparty group when you have new counterparties, but here is a link to the Lotus Notes request form.  You should be able to be see all the pertinent information needed by the GCP group besides contact name and address.  If you can supply this information, I'd be happy to submit the request for you.  Otherwise, please let me know if you find someone to finish this.  I don't have access to change the counterparty on the deal, so my group will not be able to attach a contract until the counterparty is there.

It would now appear that the primary time consuming matters that remain to be addressed as conditions to closing are as follows:

1.	Obtaining NCUC no further action authorization;
2.	Satisfying ourselves that all that can be done has been done in terms of Enron Corp. Guaranty/LC replacement-substitution;
3.	Finalizing the form of EEI Master to be put in place for Contractor Transactions between EPMI & NCPH (Heather has talked to credit about terms that need to be 	finalized;  
4.	Arrange for Bring Down Certificates on 3 Title Policies; and
5.	Updating any Representations or Warranties that are/were not true as of the SPA signing date.

If any of you are aware of other significant/time consuming pre-closing items, please let me know. 

It appears that Item 1. might be satisfied early next week, or by the following week at the latest.  The remainder of the items, together with preparation of closing deliverables could be accomplished within that time frame as well.  I will attempt to set up a meeting following Heather Kroll's return to Houston on Wednesday, June 20, to discuss completion of pre-closing matters.

Jay Sonnenberg will be updating and distributing a more formal Closing Checklist in the meantime.

Please call if you have any questions.

"FW: Discussion Drafts for Oakhill and Bay Gas","
	Barbara,

	I've included the 1st draft that Gerald emailed to me before leaving on vacation.
	The text that I've inserted is in blue.  There is some text that I've excluded relative
	to the ""Start Date"" because of issues that surround the commodities (gas and power)
	by not having a Firm Start Date. 

	 The concern will be what happens if the installation by ECS (or our appointee's like Hanover 
	and Rusk County Electric Cooperative) is delayed (i.e. construction risk).  My suggestion is
	to have the customer operate under the Test Period provision for the first 2 or 3 months of the
	deal and push the Start Date back.  Ultimately we are still picking a date that everyone is 
	comfortable that we can accommodate before taking financial positions with the commodities.

	 I'm open for suggestions.   

	mk

Subject:	Discussion Drafts for Oakhill and Bay Gas

Mark,  Attached are rough drafts of the following documents for the noted projects:

Bay Gas Storage
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft Lease Agreement
3.  Draft O&M Agreement

   

Oakhill
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft O&M Agreement for Hanover to provide maintenance.

  

Please note that these are really rough based on the limited information available at this time.  I did not provide a lease agreement for Oakhill as you indicated Hanover would finance/lease the Electric Motor Drivers to ECS.  If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be used.  If Hanover is providing a purchase option, the lease agreement would need to be modified for the purchase option.  My suggestion is to provide these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are fine tuned, these drafts will be modified.  But this gives them the basic idea.   In my absence please contact Barbara for coordination of legal support in the event you cannot wait until I return.  Thanks.

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

"Re: FW: Bridgeline-Crawfish ROW agreement  My file ENR-091-1005","Gerald:

    I reviewed the enclosed agreement and made several revisions.  I am
enclosing a redlined version showing my revisions for your convenience.
 My major revisions are summarized as follows:

    1.  I changed all references to ""rights of way"" or ""easement"", to
""servitude"" or ""sevitude of right of use"".  Louisiana law does not use
the terms ""easement"" or ""right of way"".

    2.  I rearranged the last three clauses in the 1st paragraph for
clarity.

    3.  I combined the content of the 5th paragraph into the 3d paragraph.

    4.  I change the 6th paragraph slightly to strengthen the rights
retained by Grantor.

    5.  I added language to paragraph 7 to give more detail to the
process of abandonment and to strengthen the rights of the Grantor upon
abandonment.

 Please call with any questions or if you need further help with this.
 Thank you for allowing me to provide professional advice on this matter.

Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:

     1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000.
     2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are
currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.
     3.  I don't know.  I don't think that any of the licenses were new
after the transaction date.  Robert, any different info?
     4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you
forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.
Do you agree, Robert?

To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They
were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's
40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these
licenses has been filed.

Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the
licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into
Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  LRC is still held 100% by Enron North America
Corp.

   Gerald, this is just to follow up on our prior phone conversations re:
   the
   sale of Louisiana Resources' assets (including licenses) to Bridgeline .
   As
   I mentioned, what is important to our inquiry is whether transfer of
   applications were filed prior to the consummation of the above
   transaction
   whereby the assets of Louisiana Resources' were acquired.  I will need
   the
   following transaction information:

   *  When did the transaction close?  The exact date. 2/?/2000
   *  Which licenses where part of that transaction?
   *  Which licenses were obtained by filing a new application after the
   transaction date?
   *  Which stations are constructed/operating?

   As a reminder, we are under a deadline to get this information to the
   FCC.
   To make the deadline I will need the information by tomorrow or Monday
   at
   the latest.  Please call/email with any questions.

   Thanks and have a Happy Thanksgiving.

"Project Gallup","
Jean/Cris,
As a follow-up to our meeting last week, I reviewed the Gallup closing documents and I spoke to Gerald Nemec today regarding whether Enron Corp. issued a financial guarantee to ECHO (funded by Natwest/Equity Investor, Patty Melcher) to compensate for the risk from closing to the start of operations.  Gerald Nemec and Mark Knippa both confirmed that Enron did not issue a financial guarantee, even though the project closed prior to the start of operations.  At the time of closing, construction was about 2/3 complete and the legal documents were in place stating a definitive start date.  The definitive start date ensured that funds would flow regardless of whether the facility was operational.  Essentially, TW was on the hook for the annual payment, etc. beginning on the start date outlined in the legal agreement.  The investors were comfortable with the project's progress at the time of closing and they basically were willing to take TW/Enron credit risk without a financial guarantee. 
  
Let me know if you have any other inquiries.

Thanks, Lisa

"FW: GTC clearing report","Judy,

Attached is a very simple report I pulled together on those ENA Upstream counterparties you are trying to get masters in place with.  I ran a Sitara report to check those names against two GTC types that weren't already reported under my regular report:  Committed Reserves GTC and Wellhead Pooling Point GTC.  I'll email you my regular report and I can run something like that in the future once you decide on the threshold levels you'd like to see.

Judy,

For ENA, we have set thresholds of reporting any counterparty with 100 or more total transactions clearing on online GTCs, 100 or more deals on spot GTCs, and 30 or more deals on Firm GTCs.  While some of these obviously don't apply to ENA Upstream now (online deals), others do.  Do you want to keep the same thresholds or lower yours?  I can create a separate spreadsheet for Gerald to review if you want to have separate, and lower, deal counts.  Please let me know.  I'm getting ready to send out the August report (this is usually done the first week of the month following production).

Judy, we currently run a monthly report that we give to Legal showing all counterparties with excess GTCs (both telephonic and online).  We also include credit information and comments regarding the status of any masters we may already have in place with the CP (if applicable).  Since Legal uses this as a tool to see where we really need to focus our negotiating efforts, would you like the report changed to include the ENA Upstream GTCs?  We can then include Gerald Nemec (and any other Legal folks you'd like to add) on the distribution.

Please let me know what you think.  If you'd like the ENA Upstream GTCs included, I will need to work with our IT guy to have the report format changed.  I'll also be happy to send you the August report once I'm done (hopefully today) so that you can see what I'm talking about.

Note that there is no MDQ.  From the printout, it looked as though all volumes in excess of 1700 MMBtu per day were priced as gas daily.  If there is an MDQ, we will need to insert it.  Thanks.

Sandi, 

I don't think that the Agency agreement is going with HPL.  If that has changed, please let me know.  I asked Dave Baumbach about it and he agreed with me.

As far as signing the agreement, I need one thing added.  Under Section 4.A., we need to add something like, ""IN the event that ENA owes Company, payment will be made to Company after ENA has received funds from third party sales of excess supply.""  This situation has occurred when the plant was down for the majority of the month.  ENA sold the supply and net owed Tenaska IV a large sum of money after the admin fee was netted out.

Additionally, TXU pipeline has sent an amendment to the transport contract (adding receipt points).  The contract still has Tenaska Gas Co as a counterparty, instead of Enron North America.  How do we get this corrected?

            Hi Jennifer,  How was your weekend?  Did you do anything
   exciting?
      I
            was
            invited to go with some friends to the GK on Friday night, but
   I
         thought
            that two Fridays in a row would be pushing my luck, so I begged
      off.

"RE: Construction Expedition Letter","Chris,
 


Why are they removing language that let's us ""..confer with Gulf's project management...and subcontractors...""?  What's to hide?  Remember, lack of such information is what led us to this 11th hour problem to begin with.....reference the information I passed along yesterday.  These folks do not appear to be familiar with what it takes to manage a fast track project.  They don't monitor subcontractors performance on a real-time basis and/or in great enough detail to understand what is really going on and in order to AVOID problems -- rather than find creative ways to manage them. It's a black box mentality to construction management, and it's risky.  As I recall, their attorney said something like ""We mange things differently than you might, and that's just the way it is.  Sorry if you (Enron) don't like our style."" While he was referring to right-of-way acquisition at that moment, I can assure you that their project managers (Howell, Sims, Powell) have the same attitude.  We need to audit construction progress in detail, because they will not.

Why don't they want to show us expediting costs?  We're still liable for all incremental costs if someone other than Gulf gets supply jurisdiction, right.  Seems to me we're still protecting our interests, which haven't been protected very well to date.  (See above!)  How can we not be concerned with our exposure to (potential) incremental costs?  If we think it is highly unlikely that anyone other than Gulf will prevail in the jurisdictional dispute, then maybe we could agree to this.  In any case, without detailed cost tracking we are creating an ""incremental cost time bomb"".  The only question is whether the regulatory / legal processes will set it off. (Pardon the insensitive analogy.)  

We need access to the information (as requested) in order to protected our interests, regardless of who is paying to get this project back on track.  If we can only get one of the items I listed, it needs to be direct access to the subcontractors.  We may not know the costs, but we will at least able to make sure construction progress is acceptable, and have a feel for construction-related risks.  If we need to give up something to get the agreement signed, give up interaction with Gulf Power project team and/or all Gulf Power project reporting.  It is very difficult to get a meeting or conference with them anyway.  Their project tracking and reporting are practically non-existent, and have no substantial value -- otherwise we wouldn't be in our current predicament.  
 
Not sure if this constitutes comments or a short speech, but I hope it helps!
 
Dave

Haswell will be working tomorrow. He will not be in Thursday or Friday. I can call him tomorrow and that will give you the remainder of the afternoon to circulate your responses. I have to leave shortly for a dentists appointment of long standing. You could call Haswell if you prefer, but I think it better that I act as buffer. You can always fire me if I screw up.

"Napoleonville land sale","Ana, 

Per our conversation earlier today:

Our survey shows the tracts we are selling consist of 330.12 acres.  For the purpose of the DASH, we need to have a precise book value for those 330.12 acres, so I need to confirm with you one final time the book value for that land.  

Also, the draft agreement for the land sale stipulates that all ad valorem taxes bearing against the property due and payable through 2000 have been paid.  Before we sign the agreement, we need confirmation from you that this is the case.  

Since we are trying to close this deal tomorrow (11/20), I would appreciate a quick response.  Thanks for your cooperation.

"FW: OGS Pipeline LLP - Compression Service Agreement ""Draft"" 6/13/01","
	Gerald,
	Just to be clear, this is the draft that Oakhill is reviewing and I expect to meet and have 
	discussions later today or tomorrow.

Subject:	OGS Pipeline LLP - Compression Service Agreement ""Draft"" 6/13/01
Importance:	High
Sensitivity:	Confidential



	Tim, 
	Here is the ""Draft"" CSA that we discussed.  As I mentioned, I have taken some time and worked
	in the specifics to our transaction.   This is a Draft that I need you to review and make comments
	back to me.  Since yourself, John and your Alliant resource are in town Monday & Tuesday, I would
	like to establish a time that I can meet and walk through the agreement and discuss any specifics.
	This would probably be most productive after you have had the opportunity to review but before you
	spend a lot of time trying to work everything out.  

	Either way, I'll make myself available Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning to meet.  Again, I want
	to re-enforce the need for us to get this document executed before the end of this month to take
	advantage of the equipment, installation and maintenance contract included in this Compression Service
	quote.  As always, the commodity pricing will need to be re-established at the time of our execution
	of the final CSA.

	There will also be a separate Maintenance Agreement whereby ECS will contract for all the maintenance
	services over the CSA's duration from the Start Date to the end of Term.  To ensure that we have no
	confusion, I'm assuming that Oakhill is providing day-to-day Operation of the facility the equipment and 
	your system.  Our Services will cover the ""Electrical Drive System"" up to the shaft of the compressors
	and we will have an option for the term maintenance of the remaining equipment on these skids (compressors,
	cylinders, valves, dumps, pre-lube system, etc.) 
		

 	
		 
	
	Feel free to contact me with any questions or comments between now and our meeting.  My office phone
	is 713-853-3463 and my cell phone is 713-851-7703.


	Thanks,
	Mark Knippa

Hi Gerald,

I didn't get a copy of the new Committed Reserves/First Purchaser GTC from you last night.  I didn't know you if you forgot or if there was a problem with the email, so I thought I'd ask again.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

Paul,
Sorry this has taken so long, but I finally got feedback from John on these
contract documents.   Here is the status of the following documents:

Release of Capacity and Agency Agreements - sending you this back with two
suggested changes in the first section (Scope of Agreement) and additional
language in sectin 5 (Agency).

Transaction Agreement - I am ready to sign off on this document and present
it to Gordon for his signature.

Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement - sending it up to Legal for
thier initials.  The Legal people sined off on the draft, so this should not
be a problem.


	 <<Greeley Letter Enron Agreement1.doc>>

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Also, I have notified and
awarded the gas contracts  in Colorado covered under the last RFP Greeley
sent out.

Also, on another note.  Are you aware of the scheduled maintaince on CIG at
Ft. Lupton and Young Storage in August?  Greeley had a message from CIG
about some scheduled maintaince at Ft. Lupton that would prohibit storage
injections.  I believe that this was scheduled to last approximately two
weeks.  Please let me know if this is going to cause Enron any problems in
Filling the Young Storage.

Thanks....Robert

  We flew into Shanghai and explored for 2 days.  Next we went to Qingdao

Beijing was the highlight of the trip.  The Great Wall was pretty
incredible.  Should have some pics shortly.

Work is going well! Way to busy for my taste.  That's what I get for being

Typical Mark.  Any plans on coming to Houston anytime?

Thanks for your comments.  I've made a few revisions (hightlighted in BLUE); in particular, I've clarified the Capital Expenditures Section 4 (we want to differentiate the transmission line from the remainder of the capital estimates).  We are still working on the items in red and in yellow.

One question for you in Section 8.  Why did you add the following sentence ""Oakhill would maintain ownership and responsibility for all maintenance of the reciprocating gas compressors throughout the contract term""?  Its not clear to me why we'd include a sentence on gas compression.  Let me know.

I have three questions about the attached letter.

2. Are the confirms in the name of ENA? The August - October deals were done between ENA Upstream and Linder.
3. Are the confirmations under GTC Spot? I thought they were going to be GTC FIRM.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

GT,  That's cool.  Tell Heather happy B-day.    I will put No Le Hace on my
calendar.  Wouldn't miss it this time.  The next couple of weekends are
busy, so I might just wait until the No Le Hace festivals to make it to
Austin.

How is everything else going?  Have you been taking it easy at work, since
the summer is here?

   Hey Dude,  How is it going?  Was thinking about maybe making a road trip

"Temporaries' Access Rights","THIRD request!  Many of you haven't granted calendar access rights to our Legal Dept. Temporary IDs.  The temporaries that fill in for our Assistants need this access not only to set up meetings and keep your calendars current, but to refer to in case there's an emergency and you need to be found.

Assistants:  It is helpful if you block the time on your bosses' calendars for their vacations and trips.  That way when we call up the calendars the temps won't have to guess how to answer their calls.   (""I don't know where they are"" is not an acceptable answer!)

Please follow the instructions below. 

For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8

To set up access:
1.	Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and
	then ""Folder List"")

2.	Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab

4.	Left click on ""Add"".
	Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the ""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click ""OK""

5. 	You should now be back in the ""properties"" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the ""Shift"" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has ""own"" or ""owner""
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on ""Apply"", then ""OK"".

6.	Right click on your ""Calendar"" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

"Enron Compression Services Proposal","Andy,

Per our recent discussions, you will find a proposal from Enron Compression Services to provide HP Services to KNG Energy to meet it growth expectations (either as is or through a new joint venture/ownership structure from the current bidding process).  We have made this proposal to conform with the expansion scenarios outlined in the offering memorandum and have provided flexibility for a 60%-90% load factor to be utilized for both stations.  We would be happy to have a tele-conference to go through this proposal with you.  You will also note that the latter part of the presentation begins to outline additional options (on a notional value basis) that we can put into a deal to increase the value of the deal over the proposed 10-year term.

We took a look at the strategic value of the underlying assets that were offered and were unfortunately not able to come up with a structure that we could support for either the purchase or re-capitalization of KNG Energy's assets.  We appreciate the opportunity to bid on these assets and are happy to work with you to optimize our proposal to fit the ultimate owner's needs for expansion.

I have also attached our group's brochure and a copy of a recent article about our group in Gas Daily.  Once again, thank you for the opportunity and I will call you in the near future to discuss this proposal further.

Chris Hilgert
Director
Enron Compression Services

 
  

The parties hereto understand and agree that the PROPOSAL sets forth each party's preliminary understanding of the proposed transactions with KNG EnerGY and Enron compression services.  This PROPOSAL does not create and is not intended to create a binding and enforceable contract between the parties or a duty on the part of any party hereto to negotiate in good faith toward a binding contract and may not be relied upon by either party as the basis for a contract by estoppel or otherwise, but rather this proposal evidences a non-binding expression of the understanding of each party to endeavor, without obligation, to negotiate the terms of a proposed transaction.

"RE: ECS Compression Co, LLC (""LLC"")","I am also working on pulling information out of SAP and assisting with the ECS financial data since Karen is so involved in the monthly close as well as other requests.  I have to agree with Karen.  It is taking some time to search thru the data in SAP since some of the transactions were paid, received, recorded in ENA and we have to search thru the 1000's of transactions in ENA.  Also the files and records have not all been retrieved since essentially no financials have been prepared this year and anyone who worked on ECS in the past are gone.  I am trying to piece all of this together, unfortunately it will take a little time.  I can call Patty and discuss this with her and set her expectations for receiving the financial data as soon as we can pull the finacial data together next week.  I just think it needs to be as comprehensive and accurate as possible before it is sent.

Stuart,
The financial data will not be completed by tomorrow.  As I stated in yesterday's meeting, I would not know how long it would take to prepare everything until I looked at it.  The memo will have to be sent without the financial data.

Attached is my draft of the ""two-pager"" for LLC.  Obviously it is going to be a bit longer than two pages.

Please take a look and provide any comments that you might have.

Also:

1)  Gerald please provide summaries of the debtor contracts as you did for NNG and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo;
2)  Karen - please continue your efforts (in cooperation with Mark) to provide the revenues/expenses both actual and forecasted to be attached to the memo;
3)  Mark - please provide the deal structure diagrams for the deals (obviously you already gave me Gallup - but please forward to me electronically) and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo.

I really would like to have this memo completed by mid-day tomorrow so that I can get it to Patty M as promised.  Thanks in advance for your efforts.

Regards

Stuart

We clearly need to understand the contractual arrangements they have with the third party.... if we go with part 2.  Dave, what are their plans to liquidate their july position? Do they have any hedges on now?  What generation asset are they delaying... ( important info). Get ENA a copy of all purchase and sale agreements including ( executed copies/originals). Make sure that they do not have confidentiality issues related to the confirms... If they do not, then we can look at them... if they do have CA issues then Gerald is advising me that they will need the consent of the seller to let ENA look at agreements.

Bridgeline was checking the issues on their side concerning payment directly to Dow.  We made it clear that we prefer they directly pay Dow.  They were supposed to get back with Brian later today.  Sorry I didn't make that clear earlier.

We need to figure out how to play this out ASAP so that we know how much cash needs to be sent out.  My guess is that we would prefer to have Bridgeline pay Dow directly.  I have a voicemail from the guy at Dow and would like to get back with him on our plan.  Let me know.  Thanks.

Brian, Karen Gruesen, and I had a discussion this morning with Bridgeline.  We agreed that they owed and would pay the lease fees, but  the remainder of the charges were not subject to reimbursement.  The only issue was would they reimburse us or pay Dow directly.  They are concerned about netting issues.

Subject:	Dow Invoice

I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following

1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000
    3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.

Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.

2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40
     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)

Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.

3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500

I find no basis for this in the contract.


Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey Gerald!

I finally got my computer back up.  The name of the utility is Powder River Energy Corporation - A Touchstone Energy Cooperative (I don't know if you need that last part or not).  The relationship is this:

ECS is acting as the agent on behalf of Crestone Energy Ventures, LLC to purchase power and deliver shaft horsepower.  We will be buying electricity strictly off of PRECORP's tariff.  We will also be providing the cash for PRE to build transmission to the compressor site.  Right now, the deal term is for 10 years, starting in May '02, but we will begin negotiations with them immediately.  

Last week I met with three people from PRECORP, just to begin the relationship, one of which was Clarence Moshier (Chief Operating Officer for PRECORP), who I spoke to again yesterday.  He said that they would have no problem signing a CA with us.  Basically, I just want to make sure that whatever we put in place with PRECORP cannot be relayed to Crestone by them.

Anything else you need?

Andrew

Steve, we may not need to have that meeting between ourselves and Bridgeline regarding the R/W, easements, etc on Crawfish property (at least not this week).  Roger Westbrook has been communicating directly with the Bridgeline R/W guy, and they have determined that they require the following items.  I appreciate your help (or Daigle's) in putting these together for execution.  Please communicate directly with Roger to acquire the appropriate descriptions.  

While we have Bridgeline's attention on this, let's try not to lose momentum.  Thanks for any pressure you can put on Daigle to get this done.

Subject: Crawfish Agreements


As far I know, BHLP needs the following documents from Enron for the
facilities at Crawfish.
	1)  Surface Easement for roughly 1acre OR Special Warranty Deed for Sale of roughly 2acres.
	2)  Surface Easement near River Road for existing facilities. 
(Parcel VI on Survey)(Equilon shared site).
	3)  Road Ingress/Egress (limestone road shown on Exhibit G.  Need Easement)
	4)  ROW easements for:
		A. 16"" Pipeline (1609) going northeast from the surface
facilities to the river.
		B. 16"" Pipeline (1609) going northwest from the surface
facilities to Taft (depends on land owned by Enron.  Not on Exhibit G).
		C. 16"" Pipeline (1607) coming from the southwest, going to
the surface facilities (depends on land owned by Enron).
		D. Dual 16"" Pipelines going northeast from Parcel VI across
the Mississippi River.
	5)  8"" pipeline will be abandoned.  See detail on Exhibit G.  Bridgeline to determine if abandon in place or remove.
	6)  Abandon 3"" and 16"" pipelines.  See exhibit G.
	7)  Parcels III and IV on Exhibit G will be abandoned.

Bridgeline to furnish individual certified plats for each item 1 through 4 above.

I've asked Engineering to confirm the footprint needed for the new
tanks, then have it surveyed.  For the price that was mentioned, I
prefer to buy the land; but we need to finalize the details.  That needs
to be resolved before:
	- I can build the new tanks, 
	- we can finalize the ROW documents.   

Once you have reviewed this, please call me. I'm sure that both of us
would like to move forward.

Thanks.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"ENA Upstream issues","Gerald,

On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions, the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery.  I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template.  Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts.

I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on.  Are we close to having a final version?  Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

Please get back to me as soon as possible (I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now).  Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions.

   Plans tonight?
                          03/23/2001 03:18 PM









           Hey, what's going on?  My brother-in-law and a friend of his
   are
      flying into town tonight?  We're going to head over to Gilians
   (sp?), a
      place that is supposed to be like Dave & Buster's.  We'll prob get
   there at
      about 10:00.  We thought we'd hang there for a while and then head
   to the
      downtown area and find dome kind of bar.  A couple of other friends
   of mine
      from  B-school will be joining us, I thought you might want to as
   well.
      Are
      you game?

           Write back or give me a call H: 281-251-6398, cell:
   281-687-6893.
      I'm leaving work in a few minutes if I don't respond to any email.

           later,

           Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be
   getting
      into
           Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.
   (281)
      772-9250.
           If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why
   don't
      you just
           call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great,
   we'll
      ride
           over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been
   seeing
      with me.
           My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The
      wedding is
           at 7.

           Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

      Hotel Room Confirmation








           Gerald,

           Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
   $129
      rate.
           Below
           you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
      matters
           which
           one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
      They're both
           on
           my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

           I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
   from
      SA.  I
           estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
      right?)
           We'll
           actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
   family
      from the
           Valley will be there as well.

           If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
   at
      the
           hotel
           sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
   wedding
      together
           from
           there.

           In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
   got
      him a
           gift
           yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

Subject:	FW: Bridgeline Application Deficiencies

David, enclosed is an electronic copy of a ""deficiency"" letter pertaining
the storage permit application.  The deficiencies are minor in nature and
should be easy to remedy.

Robert Morgan and I met with Joe Ball yesterday and had a chance to discuss
the permit application.  The meeting was not planned, but it just so
happened that Joe had recently completed his review of the application.

We also discussed the timeline for a final order approving storage in the
cavern.  Assuming we can provide the information requested in the letter on
or before July 6, we can take the application to hearing on July 26.  After
the hearing there will be a 1 week post-hearing comment period (approx. Aug.
3).  Commissioner's proposed order and findings of fact should be complete
on Aug 10.  Within 7 days the commissioner should send proposed findings of
fact to Natural Resources Committee for review and comment (Aug 17).  The
order will likely be signed no later than the 1st week in September.  It is
possible that it could be as early as the last week in August.

I discussed with Joe Ball the issue of dewatering.  He again said that we
can begin dewatering anytime now upon notice the office of conservation.
Joe interprets the regs to allow us to take steps necessary to ""convert"" the
cavern from Brine to NG, but we cannot store NG without a permit.  Joe
considers dewatering to be part of the conversion process.

I would not recommend dewatering until we have provided Joe with the
information identified in the attached letter and he has set the matter for
public hearing (probably the first or second week in July).  Joe will not
set the matter for hearing until he considers the project to be technically
sound and in compliance with Statewide Order 29-M.  After Joe has ""blessed""
this project, it is unlikely that we will have to do further sonar testing
(which I understand is difficult during dewatering).

Please call me at your convenience to discuss our response to the deficiency
letter.  504-584-9122.

funds to be available shall be no less than the amount identified in the
closure plan cost estimate.

4.	Provide a plan to monitor ground subsidence at and in the vicinity
of the storage cavern.  The frequency of subsidence monitoring shall be
scheduled to occur semi-annually during the same period.  The plan shall
include submission of subsidence monitoring reports to the Office of
Conservation.

"FW: Oakhill - Rusk County Update","
Gerald,
FYI with the attorney at Rusk County Electric Cooperative.  

I'm expecting to be in contact with the Alliant people later today and 
see if we can get any specific comments out of them regarding the 
CSA.  John Gillies indicated yesterday that this ""new"" Alliant rep
was reviewing the economics of the project yesterday and I know he
has the draft CSA. 

I met with Hanover yesterday to work through the installation and 
coordination now with GE providing all the electric equipment and
maintenance services.  HCC indicated that the Operating Lease
was emailed to me yesterday & I need to find it this morning.  I will
forward to you. 

The maintenance & service agreement from HCC will be somewhat
dependant on their sub-agreement with GE (which will cover the
electric drive system in total) and we should  see language from 
HCC & GE today.  ECS will have (1) agreement with HCC to cover
all the maintenance (bumper to bumper). Jim indicated it will look
like our Bammel agreement with HCC but expanded to accommodate
all the equipment (electrical & mechanical).

Thanks,
mk

Ellen,

Based on some additional information from Linder regarding their Pre-pay deal, the confirmations for the August confirmations as well as any confirmations that we prepare through the end of the Pre-payment deal that runs through October will need to be GTC Firm confirmations with modified MDQ language.  Please get with Gerald Nemec if you have questions regarding how to prepare the MDQ language. 

Also, please prepare these confirmations as soon as possible. The pre-pay paperwork must go out to the customer by August 10th; and Stacy Dickson needs the confirmations in order to complete the pre-pay contract.

Thanks,
Judy

Add the new well
Change the working interest
Include a statement to address our timing for changing working interest to the month succeeding the month that we are notified
Extend the contract an additional year from the end of the contract term

I will bring you copies of the contract (including the assignment from Enron North America to ENA Upstream) as well as the working interest sheet as soon as I have them. Jill would like to have this contract completed this week since the well is expected to begin flowing any day.

Subject:	Palo Alto NGSA and Transaction Agreements

Stacy: 
I have attached the one page Exhibit ""B"" - Customer's Load that I received from Monica Padilla this morning, for incorporation into the NGSA.  Please let me know if you have any problems opening this document. 
The NSGA appears to be just about ready.  I have no further comments on the draft you sent by email this morning.  You might want to check the spacing and alignment of the Article 10 paragraphs on page 9, and eliminate the underlining for (a) and (b) of Article 11 on page 10.  We have provided ENA with the City Council authorizing resolution, and I assume you will providing a Certificate of Incumbency or similar evidence of authority for ENA (similar to that provided for the Enfolio Agreement) unless you propose some alternative. 
The Transaction Agreement also appears to be in order, with the following minor editorial changes: 
the address should be changed to City of Palo Alto, P.O. Box 10250, Palo Alto, CA 94303, Utilities Department-3rd Floor, Attn: Monica Padilla, Resource Planner
delete the period at the end of the first paragraph after the word ""deliver""
change the date on page 2 from June 1, 2001 to July 1, 2001
add a period at the end of the Termination paragraph
capitalize the word ""BaseLoad"" in the paragraph entitled ""Fixed Pricing"" ; and
provide a little more space for the signature lines

Once these changes are made, please email a final version to me and Monica Padilla.  I really appreciate your efforts and kind cooperation in getting these documents finalized.  Please call if you have any questions.

If we don't assign the ENA Master, the confirm will need to be a GTC Dedicated Reserves confirmation.

The specific question is: can we utilize Com Ed for E service at Nicor's ""Troy Grove"" Facility? (Located near Troy Grove, ILL- approx 10 Miles North of the Town of La Salle, ILL) The Com Ed substation we would like to have power delivered at is approx 7 Miles N. of the facility near the town of Mendota, ILL.  

Notes: 1) Nicor does not currently have an ILL Power service drop.(They are totally self gen.) 
           2) We would build line up to Com Ed and buy at the substation.

I think it would be helpful going forward to elicit the counterparty's
organizational ID number in the signature block where we currently obtain
its jurisdiction of organization and location of chief executive office.
This would probably save a bit of time and money.

"GT's email?","	Hey G,

	Haven't heard from you, what's going on?  Things are same 'ol here
at work, am going on vacation to San Antonio next week.  Hey, I'm going to
be in Austin tomorrow for work and am planning to play golf in the
afternoon.  I plan to play at a course that is towards Houston on 290, and
since George works out there somewhere, I thought he might be able to join
in.  Do you have his email and/or phone numbers (work/home)?

	Have you been playing any golf?  We got a new analyst here at work
from UT and he's got got fever.  He got me to play last Friday (my first
time in Houston!) and now I've got the fever again.  My wife is not
thrilled, but.................  So if you play at all, we should hook up.

	Thanks,
	E

	Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a
little
	early, so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a
good
	time on Friday night?  How is everything going?

	It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights
last
	week to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of
the new
	car with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points
on
	Friday and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

	Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of
him
	since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.

	     Hey, what's going on?  My brother-in-law and a friend of his
are
	flying into town tonight?  We're going to head over to Gilians
(sp?), a
	place that is supposed to be like Dave & Buster's.  We'll prob get
there at
	about 10:00.  We thought we'd hang there for a while and then head
to the
	downtown area and find dome kind of bar.  A couple of other friends
of mine
	from  B-school will be joining us, I thought you might want to as
well.
	Are
	you game?

	     Write back or give me a call H: 281-251-6398, cell:
281-687-6893.
	I'm leaving work in a few minutes if I don't respond to any email.

	     Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be
getting
	into
	     Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.
(281)
	772-9250.
	     If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why
don't
	you just
	     call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great,
we'll
	ride
	     over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been
seeing
	with me.
	     My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The
	wedding is
	     at 7.

	     Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

	     G

	Hotel Room Confirmation








	     Gerald,

	     Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
$129
	rate.
	     Below
	     you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
	matters
	     which
	     one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
	They're both
	     on
	     my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

	     I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
from
	SA.  I
	     estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
	right?)
	     We'll
	     actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
family
	from the
	     Valley will be there as well.

	     If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
at
	the
	     hotel
	     sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
wedding
	together
	     from
	     there.

	     In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
got
	him a
	     gift
	     yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

Have we heard anything from Texaco as to their position on the testing of the Sorrento II cavern to determine the appropriate pressure? Any more settlement talks? 

We are ready, willing and able to initiate the arbitration proceedings. Let's talk at your convenience.

Dave - As I mentioned on your voice mail, Brian has authorized payment of the fire eyes and dewatering line amounts. We probably need to get an invoice from Bridgeline to pay these. Can you handle this? Let's discuss.

 Judy attached is the Aspect Amendment as discussed.   The  first paragraph has been revised to reflect the assignment to ENA.   Article 2. now states term dates.  Concerning Articles 3.1 and 3.3, Gerald would not agree to ""one sentence"". Finally, I  included a provision regarding changes to working interest (see # 9), and incorporated meter number on Schedule I.  Please let me know if you have any other questions and or changes.

"RE: GTC clearing report - REVISED","Judy,

I'm not sure why the GTC Pooling Point contracts were not picked up, so I reran the Sitara reports.  The reports appear to be correct now, so please review and let me know if you have any other suggestions.

Stacey,

I did have one concern regarding the report. I noticed that several of the counterparties that I noted as needing masters had zeroes for the count of GTC Firm confirms. When I ran a search on them, there were several GTC Wellhead or GTC Pooling Point contracts. Can you check on those counterparties with zero to see why they are not showing contracts?

Judy,

Attached is a very simple report I pulled together on those ENA Upstream counterparties you are trying to get masters in place with.  I ran a Sitara report to check those names against two GTC types that weren't already reported under my regular report:  Committed Reserves GTC and Wellhead Pooling Point GTC.  I'll email you my regular report and I can run something like that in the future once you decide on the threshold levels you'd like to see.

Judy,

For ENA, we have set thresholds of reporting any counterparty with 100 or more total transactions clearing on online GTCs, 100 or more deals on spot GTCs, and 30 or more deals on Firm GTCs.  While some of these obviously don't apply to ENA Upstream now (online deals), others do.  Do you want to keep the same thresholds or lower yours?  I can create a separate spreadsheet for Gerald to review if you want to have separate, and lower, deal counts.  Please let me know.  I'm getting ready to send out the August report (this is usually done the first week of the month following production).

Thanks,

I think that is a good idea. I have attached a list of the counterparties that reflect those suppliers that are our highest priority because of the number of transactions as well as other provisions that are negotiated each month. Please let me know if there is anything else that you may need from me.

Judy, we currently run a monthly report that we give to Legal showing all counterparties with excess GTCs (both telephonic and online).  We also include credit information and comments regarding the status of any masters we may already have in place with the CP (if applicable).  Since Legal uses this as a tool to see where we really need to focus our negotiating efforts, would you like the report changed to include the ENA Upstream GTCs?  We can then include Gerald Nemec (and any other Legal folks you'd like to add) on the distribution.

Please let me know what you think.  If you'd like the ENA Upstream GTCs included, I will need to work with our IT guy to have the report format changed.  I'll also be happy to send you the August report once I'm done (hopefully today) so that you can see what I'm talking about.

Thanks!

Gerald, we recently placed a $50,000 bond for HPL for Franchise Tax Certification for you.  

I understand from our broker, John L. Wortham that our surety, St. Paul/Seaboard Fire & Marine was informed that Marsh USA will be handling the HPL bonds effective 06-01-01 (please see attached email).

I am attaching a list of outstanding bonds that HPL has in place.   Should these bonds be canceled? Or if these bonds are still required, you may wish to consider placing with your new agent of record, Marsh USA.  They can either be replaced all at once or just prior to expiration. 

Please note while most of the bonds were placed with St. Paul/Seaboard Fire & Marine there are a couple that were placed with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.   

Please let me know how you wish to handle the outstanding bonds.. Thanks.  

If you have questions, please give me a call 713 853-5687.

Mary, we have received information from Roger Bumgarner at St. Paul/Seaboard that Marsh USA has been appointed agent of record effective June 1, 2001 on the HPL bonds he writes.

As you know, there are three bonds with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and two through Insurance Company of North America.  I presume we will  be receiving notice that Marsh has been appointed on them, also.   However, we have not yet received information to that effect.

"FW: Construction Expedition Letter","Gerald,

I'm ok with the draft except I would like to see some language for tracking costs, at least on an aggregate basis so we can assess the risk as the project develops.  I believe that our risk is near zero if the project is going to come in for less than $5.5 MM overall.  I would hope that Gulf Power is appropriately incentivized to manage their way towards a less than $5.5 MM number as they may ultimately lose it back to the commission in lower rates.  Push this and any other comments back to Jeff and let's get this closed up for signature tomorrow morning.

Thanks,

"CA for Encore","Gerald,

Here is the information that you requested.

Counter party:  

Encore Acquisition Partners

Address:  

777 Main St., Ste. 1400
Fort Worth, TX 76102

Scope:  

The scope of this project is to analyze, develop and propose a compression services package that will optimally manage Encore's current and future horsepower requirements.  In order to do this we will need to explain our financial structures and gain access to information pertaining to their compression facilities and existing power agreements. 

Email me with the completed CA so that I can forward it on to the client.

Thanks

I didn't get a copy of the new Committed Reserves/First Purchaser GTC from you last night.  I didn't know you if you forgot or if there was a problem with the email, so I thought I'd ask again.

Rudwell, 
Per our telcon, the attached document is the Corporate Guarantee that Aquila Inc. is offering on behalf of ACN Energy to provide credit support.  We propose replacing our parental guarantee from ACN Inc. with the Aquila guarantee.  This will allow us to have a larger credit line and increase our ability to purchase supplies from Enron.

I am also working on pulling information out of SAP and assisting with the ECS financial data since Karen is so involved in the monthly close as well as other requests.  I have to agree with Karen.  It is taking some time to search thru the data in SAP since some of the transactions were paid, received, recorded in ENA and we have to search thru the 1000's of transactions in ENA.  Also the files and records have not all been retrieved since essentially no financials have been prepared this year and anyone who worked on ECS in the past are gone.  I am trying to piece all of this together, unfortunately it will take a little time.  I can call Patty and discuss this with her and set her expectations for receiving the financial data as soon as we can pull the finacial data together next week.  I just think it needs to be as comprehensive and accurate as possible before it is sent.

Stuart,
The financial data will not be completed by tomorrow.  As I stated in yesterday's meeting, I would not know how long it would take to prepare everything until I looked at it.  The memo will have to be sent without the financial data.

Attached is my draft of the ""two-pager"" for LLC.  Obviously it is going to be a bit longer than two pages.

Please take a look and provide any comments that you might have.

Also:

1)  Gerald please provide summaries of the debtor contracts as you did for NNG and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo;
2)  Karen - please continue your efforts (in cooperation with Mark) to provide the revenues/expenses both actual and forecasted to be attached to the memo;
3)  Mark - please provide the deal structure diagrams for the deals (obviously you already gave me Gallup - but please forward to me electronically) and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo.

I really would like to have this memo completed by mid-day tomorrow so that I can get it to Patty M as promised.  Thanks in advance for your efforts.

Regards

Stuart

"Assignment of El Paso Transport","John, I am pleased to report that West Gas Orig has completed the permanent assignment of approx 47,000 MMBtu/day of El Paso Transport to Public Service of New Mexico. This capacity was assigned with varying start dates. late 02 and early 03, with no credit risk associated with this transaction as a condition of the assignment was an unconditional release of ENA.  ENA assigned this capacity at max rate ( which meets all FERC policy issues)and we were able to generate $3.0 MM of incremental value which was granted to Stephanie Miller from Mike Grigsby.  

In addition to the MTM of approx $ 3MM, this transaction reinforces the good working relationship between trading and marketing and may enhance ENA's trading position by removing some of the risks associated with this pipe. These risks include, flow rate risk, demand charge tariff changes, receipt point pool allocation risks, and potential MTM erosion and of course FERC/regulatory pressures.

Our work is nowhere near complete on this as we continue to create structures and discussion around the 200,000/day which is a little more complicated to shed. In the meantime our group continues to promote the placement of the remaining capacity either through other producers or generators and we anticipate the assignment of another  small package early next week. 

Thanks to those who helped out in this effort, including legal, regulatory, risk, structuring, trading and my origination team !!!    

regards, BT

attached docs and you will be receiving the original for your signature in
the mail.  Brian and Jeanie, I have changed the resolutions slightly from
what I sent over to you on 7/12.  These docs are designed around the
Compensation Committee idea where the Compensation Committee signs the Plan,
not Randy.

Let me know if you have any questions or are not in agreement.  Please send

"Sale of Assumption parish property  Our File ENR-02","Gerald:

Attached is my draft ""Purchase and Sale Agreement"" based on the form
used in Texas.  The following are the major revisions which I made:

1.  I put the property description in the body of the agreement.  It is
short enough and I find this prevents problems which occasionally come
up when using Exhibits.  I also added a blank for the municipal address
of the improvements.  This is required by Louisiana law, IF the property
has an address.

2.  In paragraph ""1""  and in the Act of Cash Sale, I added a reservation
of mineral rights.  If you are not concerned about this it can be taken
out.

3.  In paragraph ""3""  I added language specifically waiving buyer's
claims under the Louisiana laws of Redibition  which are specific legal
warranties.

4.  I changed paragraph ""5"" to limit buyer's indemnity to matters
arising after the closing date.

5.  In paragraph ""7""  I added a provision to allow the arbitrator to
order specific performance.  I also added provisions allowing the
parties to enforce the arbitrator's orders in court, and allowing the
parties resort to the courts for injunctive relief, if necessary.

6.  I added a provision for awarding attorney's fees in paragraph ""13"".

7.  I added paragraphs ""12"", ""14"", & ""15"" which are helpful boilerplate.

8.  I added Paragraph ""16"" to provide a drop dead date.  The length of
time is purely arbitrary.

Please call or e-mail me with any questions.

Would you like me to handle the closing also?

Subject:	Sale of Napoleonville Land

Louise,

Tomorrow, I am flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving with my father.  As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:

Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM.
Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the ""Act of Sale"" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental).

I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding ""war"" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.

Regards, Mrha

with ENA for a fixed price for each of the stations ( [Bisti & Bloomfield or Kachina] and Gallup ).  The total volume
for Dec.01 according to TW and my best determination at this time is 342,560 MMBtu which ENA has not scheduled 
reportedly because they do not have a counter-party that will transact.  

This gas volume and the resulting cash flow into ECS Compression Co. LLC is a large portion of the monthly cash
flow required to fund the billing expenses.  

Gallup Sta. - 81,605 mmbtu's (Annual Charge Conversion) appears to be a $2.35/mmbtu price for this year
                   25,521 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge) appears to be a $2.44/mmbtu price for the term
	     107,126 mmbtu's for the month with a resulting $2.37144/mmbtu blended price

Bloomfield - 110,240 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge for Oct. power billed in Nov. 01)


Bisti -         125,194 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge for Oct. power billed in Nov. 01)
                  342,560 mmbtu's for the month of Dec. to ECS

I'm not 100% sure of the pricing on these transactions but possibly with your information and Gerald Nemec's
input we can determine and confirm.



TK Lohman at TW called with a buyer for the Dec. 01 ECS gas.  Scott Walker w/ Richardson Products 817 810 9385
frequently buys TW's operational gas that is sold intra month.  The most direct method of handling the gas is to have
ENA sell the gas & the proceeds directly flow back to ECS (if that is possible).  ECS doesn't want the gas sale to 
roll into the ENA bankruptcy process.  Otherwise ENA would need to assign ECS the ability to sell the gas directly
but ECS would then need to execute a TW Pooling Agreement (or something) and there may be issues with ECS
marketing gas directly.  

Let me know what blanks you can fill in.

"Sale of Napoleonville Property  File #ENR-02","Gerald:

Attached is another draft of the Purchase and Sale Agreement with
several revisions.  I revised the property description because the
description I used before was supplied by the appraiser and was not
definite enough.  I inserted the Tax ID numbers and correct addresses
and deleted the L.P. as an intervenor.  I also set up the Cash Sale so
that it could be executed in counterparts rather than at a single closing.

The survey plat supplied with the Appraisal report appears to for the
5.081 acre tract of land previously sold.  Do you have a survey of the
Subject Property?

I will send this revised draft to the Police Jury on Monday.

Gerald,

The Upstream group is doing a considerable amount of repeat business with several customers. There is an increasing need to execute Master agreements with these customers. 

We would like to begin the development of a Master Wellhead contract that includes the same type of provisions that our Upstream GTC contracts include such as tolerances, keep whole, nomination deadlines, etc. Can you please let me know if you see any issues with changing the Master Firm contract to accomodate the Upstream business or if there is anything else that you may need from us to begin creating this Upstream Master?

Thanks,
Judy

Lisa,  My only comments would be in the Firm Transport section.  Since ENA can not directly provide firm transport on NNG, I would rephrase it as ""ENA would arrange for Firm Transport on NNG"".  As we discussed before, Unocal would need to enter directly into the FT with NNG or ENA would have to contract for the FT and then release it to Unocal pursuant to the capacity release procedures (which would include posting and bidding requirements).

"Travel Security Update","
As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.

Subject: LRC Terminal



	Brandi:

	Please see the list of requested documents and information
concerning the Louisiana Resources Company pipeline and terminal.  We have
also listed a number of questions concerning separate issues about the
facility and pipeline that we would like to discuss.  Some of the requests
are redundant to our previous discussions.  Thanks.

*	List (and copies) of all applicable state and federal agency permits
for ownership/operations of the pipeline, terminal, and pier/dock facilities
in state waters
*	Copies of all surface use agreements, right-of-ways, easements, and
leases for the combination of facilities and what ongoing costs are
associated with each
*	All other agreements that affect the operations and/or the ownership
of the rights of way and/or surface use, including, but not limited to
concurrent use agreements (i.e. where there are two pipelines within the
same right of way), Operating Agreements, Agreements with the Owner of the
Gas Plant at the beginning point of the pipeline system, marketing
agreements, etc., if any.
*	Copies of any environmental audits or reviews of the facilities
*	Historical operating statements for the facilities
*	Copies of all lease agreements for the use of the facilities
(Genesis and others)
*	Copies of any structural or integrity reviews or assessments of the
facilities
*	Please provide a description of all jurisdictional authority matters
that affect the ownership/operations of the facility
*	A list of any past violations, spills, or other accidents
*	Copy/list of all title documents to be conveyed in the sale,
including the ROW interests and leases
*	List of consents needed for transfer of the assets being purchased
*	Copies of any specific insurance requirements
*	Please explain the responsibilities for the
decommissioning/abandonment of the facility
*	Copies of construction permits from the federal, state, and parish
agencies that address natural and cultural resources along with any
compensatory mitigation agreements for resource damages
*	Regulatory compliance records, environmental and safety, for DOT or
Louisiana Office of Pipeline Safety as well as alignment sheets




*	What is the agreement/responsibility of the parties with respect to
the old Swift gas plant at the end of the pipeline?  Does LRC's
responsibility extend to the border of the site, or is the site under the
responsibility of LRC?  Who is the current owner of this site if not LRC?
Are there any agreements between the owner of this facility and LRC?
*	Are there any known non-compliance issues with respect to the
facility's operations or current design/layout?
*	Has there been any leaks within the system?
*	Does the Genesis contract require them to pig the line before their
lease expires?  We will most likely need to have the entire line pigged
prior to the transfer of ownership.
*	What is the selling entity for these assets?  If pre-existing
liabilities are discovered, what selling entity would be financially
responsible?
*	What will be the status of the tank inventory and linefill upon
closing the transaction?

"HBA Pictorial Roster Photos - FREE","
Photo Sessions for Next Pictorial Roster Set for June 19-20, August 14-15

	The Houston Bar Association has contracted with a new publisher for
the 2002 edition of the HBA Pictorial Roster, and photography sessions have
been scheduled for members who would like to have a new picture taken for
the Roster -- free of charge.
	Any member who would like to have his or her photo taken may come by
the Houston Bar Association office between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. on June 19 or June 20. Another session will be scheduled August 14 and
August 15. There is no charge for the photo, no appointment is necessary,
and the photo sessions will take only a few minutes. The Houston Bar
Association office is located downtown at 1001 Fannin, Suite 1300.
	Members may also submit their own photo for the Roster, or use an
existing photo already on file with the HBA.
	Legal Directories Publishing Company, Inc. will begin publishing
annual editions of the Pictorial Roster, rather than every two years. The
HBA hopes to have as many current photos as possible in the new Roster, so
please take advantage of this opportunity.

The only active contract we have in place with Holcomb is an Enfolio II Spot and the interest assignment letter sent by Holcomb does not cover an agreement so broad.  I spoke with Susan Herrera at Holcomb [(505) 326-0550] and asked her to send an assignment letter.  She didn't seem to really understand what I needed to I also gave her Gerald's number in Legal.

Once we receive a good assignment, I will request that the Global Counterparty group set up the CP.  Sharon will process the assignment at that point.  Depending on whether we want to split deal 901255 or repath will depend on how long this process takes.  I will keep everyone informed in the meantime.

Kelli,

I'm not sure who normally submits request to the Global Counterparty group when you have new counterparties, but here is a link to the Lotus Notes request form.  You should be able to be see all the pertinent information needed by the GCP group besides contact name and address.  If you can supply this information, I'd be happy to submit the request for you.  Otherwise, please let me know if you find someone to finish this.  I don't have access to change the counterparty on the deal, so my group will not be able to attach a contract until the counterparty is there.

 

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Any news on this?  We are having lunch with Texas Brine again today, in about 20 minutes, if there's any news I'd love to hear it....Thanks!  Eva

Mary,

Would you call AEW and find out where we can find a copy of the Tract 5B sale from Enron Storage Company to LRCI, Inc. here in our office--I know you are planning to call Sandi Braband; according to the message below, AEW must have done the work.

Also, would you please call Keith Daigle (I don't want to use Locke Lidell on this) and ask him to obtain a file stamped copy of ""all"" ESC conveyances to LRCI that are filed in the Assumption Parish Records.  Keith's phone number is 504-830-3990 or 985-898-1909.

Would you also ask Keith how he is coming on the Sorrento Right of Way Agreement that I sent him on July 7.  We need to have that back by the time Patrick Johnson returns next Monday.  Please give him a ""gentle"" prod. 

Thanks,

Steve

Steve - I have a few comments and inquiries, as follows:

An update on Tract 5B sale to TX Brine:
Paul Bieniawski spoke to Ann Elizabeth this afternoon and she told him that the law firm, Locklidell (sp.), dropped the ball and failed to file the appropriate papers with the authorities.  The papers should have been filed by now.  How can we confirm the filing? Do you have contacts at Locklidell (sp.)? Can we call the authorities? 

Proposed sale of Tracts 5A, 4B & 4A:
Since LRCI now owns the land as a result of the merger, does Enron have the authority to sale the property and thus keep 100% of any sales proceeds?

Also, I meant to mention to you earlier that I am working on another deal (Keystone/Unocal) which incorporates both compression and storage; Northern Natural Gas is involved as well and we need your help in generating a term sheet.  I will call you tomorrow to discuss further.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

You'll like.  It is fun once you get past some of the boring basics.  I
have been playing about 2 years.  I don't practice as much as I should,
however if I turn my amp up loud enough, the noise will cover all my
mistakes.  What type of music do you want to play?  Let me guess, Heavy
Metal!

   Nothing real exciting.  After Thursday, I was a little burnt so I stayed
   home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends house.  He plays
   the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session (or at
   least
   we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday I went
   furniture shopping and purchased a couch for my house.  I got kinda of
   sick
   of have no furniture in my living room. Now my house won't seem so
   pathetic
   when people visit.

   Yea, I have been to Teala's.  Can't say I have ever had the mango
   margarita
   though.  I will have to try when I get a chance.  Sounds fruity!!

      was
      invited to go with some friends to the GK on Friday night, but I

"RE: ENA - NNG Hubbard Transaction   - Past Due Amounts payable to Midland Power Cooperative (""Midland"")"," 
Gerald,
Since the agreements with Hubbard were executed by ENA (and not ECS)
is there some assignment from ENA to ECS that we should or need to look
at for post-petition business?  
 
Sounds like they are planning to not pay the delinquent bills but to make 
assurances for the billing going forward.  This is a BIG deal to these small
Cooperatives that we typically work with.  Our load generally represents a 
very large percentage of their total business and they have wholesale providers
that they have to pay.  A couple of our monthly bills could put these guys
into financial distress themselves.  
 
I need to find and read throught the contract with Midland Power before this
gets too far down the road.  I'm out today (Monday) and tomorrow dealing
with some personal stuff with my mom.  Call me tomorrow morning (9 - 10) or we can visit on Wednesday when I'm in the office.

Stuart, 

Ultimately we may have to decide if it is more advantageous to pay the pre-petition amounts due or put up whatever deposits/prepayments that may be required to give the utility ""additional assurance"" of payment of post-petition amounts.  Remember, however, that pre-petition payments will need to be considered in light of the relatively tight baskets imposed by the bankruptcy court and the DIP lenders.

Regards, 

Dave

Subject:        ENA - NNG Hubbard Transaction   - Past Due Amounts payable to Midland Power Cooperative (""Midland"") 

Chip/Dave, 

If you will recall, you had me check into whether Midland was a utility under the Bankruptcy Code.  Your thought was that past due amounts to ""utilities"" had special treatment under the law of bankruptcy.  Gerald and I communicated with David Zdunkewicz of Andrews & Kurth and concluded that Midland is likely a ""utility"" and that as such, would not be able to stop service for failure to pay pre-petition obligations.  Utilities, such as Midland, are however entitled to request additional assurance of payment.  Our first day bankruptcy order provides such additional assurance by definition, unless a utility counterparty objects in a writing sent to Steve Woods within 30 days of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy (December 2nd).

By carbon copy of this email, I am asking Steve whether he has received any such objection from Midland and, if none has been received to date, to notify myself and Gerald Nemec upon receiving any such objection. 

David Z. suggested that we wait until the expiration of the 30 day period (roughly January 2, 2002) and if nothing is received by that time, just pay invoices which relate to post-petition periods.  We must, however, pay all post petition invoices in a timely manner and it probably makes sense to pre-approve these.

Thanks 

Stuart

Build up of this number is
$204,000,000 purchase
+$4,000,705 estimated true-up
+$1,158,642 Friday final settlement

Number does not include the estimated 109K due from Westport.

The Payment schedule goes like this

NBP owes $1,158,642 through the true-up
ENA owes $1,937,200 throught the exec contract

These amounts will be netted with ENA left paying a total of $778,558.
On Oct. 1 ENA will pay $669,600.  (this is the normal wire payment for executory contract ---  $21,600 per day for 31 days)
On Nov. 1 ENA will pay 108,958 which is the balance.

These payment due not include any dollars owed due to the outstanding June and July Westport revenue payment estimated at $109,000.  Its just a coincident.    

Also, we would like to add a short statement which indicates ENA continued agreement in providing backup documentation on some the expenditures NBP has agreed to pay.

I have taken care of the 56 torch deals (in dcaf)  + sent the executed copy to the file room.  This is the one associated with wellhead GTC's.

?  There are two other Torch Deals 1085947 and 1085978 for Oct 01 and I don't believe that these are associated with the above referenced deal, but could you check?  If they are not, should I confirm as normal?

Gerald,

As a follow up to your discussion on Friday with Jill Zivley regarding the Aspect/Helmrich & Payne, et al dedicated lease contract #96055540, Jill asked me to coordinate with you to get the amendment to this contract prepared. Per my discussion with Jill, the following items need to be addressed in the amendment.

Add the new well
Change the working interest
Include a statement to address our timing for changing working interest to the month succeeding the month that we are notified
Extend the contract an additional year from the end of the contract term

I will bring you copies of the contract (including the assignment from Enron North America to ENA Upstream) as well as the working interest sheet as soon as I have them. Jill would like to have this contract completed this week since the well is expected to begin flowing any day.

If you have any questions or need anything else on this request, please let me know.

Thanks,
Judy

      Yea, someone should have warned you about the drinks being poured at
   the
      ol' GK.  They tend to be pretty stiff.

      ...and ...""Swerve on?""  I have only a select group of friends who use
      such
      terminology - you must be one of those cool-guy types!

      A night out on Thursday sounds really good right now - maybe I will
   see
      you.  Downing Street is one of my favorite low-key spots - a bit of a
      meat
      market at times, but low key nonetheless.  Not to be rude, but to be
      thorough rather, would you describe yourself as blond or more of a
      brunette?

      Yea, we definitely had our swerve on that night.  I will have to have
   a
      talk with that bartender next time, because I was over-served.
   Probably
      not a good idea to start at GK at 6  and stay til 2 in the morning.

      Thanks for your gracious response.  Let me tell you, I had much
   debate
      over
      whether email was the appropriate communication medium or the phone.
   I
      was
      swung in favor of email to save myself the potential awkwardness of
   the
      following phone conversation scenario:

           Jennifer:  ""Hello""
           Gerald:  ""Hi, Jennifer, this is Gerald.  We met at the Gallant
      Knight
      on Friday""
           Jennifer:  ""Who?""

      As I said Friday night was kind of hazy for me.  I'll probably be
      meeting
      some friends for happy hour on Thursday night at Downing Street.  If
   you
      and your friends are out, why don't you try and stop by.

      Gerald.

         Hi Jennifer,  I don't know if you remember, but we met at Gallant
      Knight
         on Friday night.  I was with Mike Robison and the Enron group.  I

         never been there before, but that place is alot of fun.

         We'll, I will be straightforward and say that I found you very

         I wanted to see if you would be interested in meeting me for lunch
   or
      a
         drink afterwork!  I apologize in advance if you are dating or
      involved
         with someone, but I thought I would take that chance.

         P.S.  Mike gave me your email address, but don't hold it against

Leslie, I am not sure of who is handling this from the accounting side and who is the commercial expert on the ""cash out protocol, but by copying this letter to Jim, I am requesting that he determine who is the commercial point person. Gerald and I can work together to determine whether the legal provisions of the cash out agreements are adequate as between third parties and Enron......concerns  have also been expressed by Brian Redmond about whether AEP will only try to settle those cash out situations where Enron is the obligor as opposed to both sides of the equation. I request that Jim set up a meeting with the appropriate persons and distribute the cash out protocol for discussion of the ""larger picture on cash out management"".

My supervisor, Rita Wynne, asked that I forward the letters to Gerald Nemec for his review, but he is unfamiliar with the AEP/Enron settlement and said it might be better for you to review them to make sure the language agrees with the settlement.

"Falcon","Gerald,

We want to do a transaction with Falcon Gas where we provide them with base gas for pressure in their facility.  We basically would park gas in their facility until Jan./04 to provide pressure.  We are making two (mutually exclusive) proposals.

Proposal 1:
Park 2 Bcf of gas on October and November 01 (33,000/day), this gas would be delivered at the Lone Star WA line where it connects to the Hill Lake storage facility (Hill Lake is building a lateral that would connect to the bigger and better connected Lone Star's ""X"" line, this will be ready by the time we pull out our gas).
Redeliver the gas to ENA at the interconnect of the Falcon lateral to the ""X"" line on January 04 (66,000/day).  The redelivery would be done all in one month (the lateral and compressors would be in place to allow for delivery in one month).

Proposal 2:  Same transaction as #1 except that:
We may get the option to convert 10% of our base gas to working gas (and therefore withdraw it) on the previous January (03).

Please let me know if you want to meet to talk about the details.  I'm attaching the draft term sheet for your review and editing (it is pre-credit but post desk pricing).

How should we confirm these deals?  We have language to confirm 2 pricing tiers.  

Judy how should we proceed to confirm these deals?  Should we start this trend of multiple pricing tiers for such small volumes?

Please let me know how we should proceed.

Gerald,

After talking with Nelson Ferries about two of his counterparties, I have found that the standard Tolerance/Keep Whole language that is now in our ENA Upstream confimation will not cover the negotiated Keep Whole for these counterparties. Nelson has negotiated a Keep Whole arrangement that takes effect whether the counterparty notifies us or not. The tolerance for their swing is 10% and the pricing is based on Gas Daily Mid. 

He has worded the Keep Whole on his deal tickets as follows:

""Volumes deliverd in excess of 10% of the FOM nom shall be prived at the applicable Gas Daily Report, Midpoint price. Volumes delivered below 10% of the FOM nom shall be kept whole at the applicable Gas Daily Mid-point up to the agreed tolerance level of 10%.""

These deals are monthly deals that are done every month and will need this language in them every month.  Please let me know how you would like to handle including of this special language in the confirmations. 

Thanks,
Judy

Georganne, this agreement will be executed Monday, dated as of Fri, Sept 28. I am out of the office on Monday, but by this e-mail I am asking Gerald Nemec to forward to you a copy of the executed agreement.  Will you please oversee the removal of the transportation positions from the MTM books as of Sept 30 (you mentioned Jeff Gosset?). The 3Q removal is important as Northern Border will be recognizing income as a result of the agreement.  We have already discussed (casually at last Monday's mtg) our accounting. We will probably need to discuss the Purchase Price Adjustment due ENA, as it has been negotiated and is being netted against the amounts due to Northern for the transportation capacity (we are the net payor). Generally speaking, AA may notice, if so, let me know, although clearly the acctg risks in this deal belong to Northern.

I've located the Gas Nomination information that was prepared for Dec. 01 and updated to include Jan. 02 business.
The Dec.01 numbers differ slightly from the initial numbers generated by James Centilli at TW as well as the numbers
that Stephanie Miller conveyed in her Dec. 18th memo.  

These values are based on the nomination worksheets & actual power bills from he respective utilities. 

Thanks

Dec.01 - Gallup
	81,605 MMBtu's = Monthly Fixed Gas 
	25,521 MMBtu's = 60% L.F. Nomination of Compression Service Charge

"RE: Ocean Contract","Gerald:

	Once again, thanks for jumping in and getting these done.  I have looked over the documents and find them to be consistent with the telephone conversations we had.  In particular, the changes you made to the Master Agreement make it much better than the draft I left with you.  The only thought relates to the Transaction Agreement.  It would be my preference to call it a ""Transaction  Agreement"" rather than a ""Confirmation"".  I think that would be more consistent with the terminology in the Master Agreement.

	Again, thanks for your efforts here.

Which contracts are you talking about?  The Asset Management Agreement between ENA and AGI Highstar or the 2 Operation and Maintenance Agreements between G.L.C.Consulting Service Incorporated and each of Lumberton Power, L.L.C. and Elizabethon Power, L.L.C.

"4-URGENT - OWA Please print this now.","
Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You will now be able to view your mailbox.

	

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

	Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

	713-853-1411

Does LCDR mean Lieutenant Commander?  On my last email his title was LT, just
lieutenant.  I guess that means our boy has been promoted......

The Horns weren't too impressive on Sat.............I was going to go to the
Colorado game, but I think I might skip now, seems like the whole season is

Amigos, I can't say anything about what we are doing out here.  I will tell
you this...the President told the military to be ready.  We are.

I appreciate the kind thoughts and words.  We're keeping the faith out here.
Take care.  Paul.

"Confidentiality Agreement","
Paul,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with Louise and myself this past Wednesday.  I felt that the meeting was very informative and that discussions between Enron and Marathon have progressed in a constructive manner to broach a potential asset management outsourcing arrangement.  

As promised during the meeting, I have attached Enron's Confidentiality / Non-disclosure agreement. Enron's appropriate legal contact for further questions or comments regarding this document would be Mr. Gerald Nemec.  He can be reached at (713) 853-3512.

After the Confidentiality Agreement is signed, I look forward to delivering a proposal for the above mentioned commercial arrangement.

If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to call.  I can be reached at (713) 853-1931.

Regards,

Jean

"Unimark: Faxed comments concerning pymt due date","Per a 11/15/01 fax notice, Unimark wishes the payment dates be ""Payment by wire on the 25th Day"". Referenced deals: 1061122; 1062624; 1063968; 1061089; 1063576; 1146397; 1064010; & 1061084. 

Okay, new kid on the block here:

I'd assume that it is a safe assessment that Unimark would prefer all future payments to be made on the 25th via wire. Lisa, is this something you'd confirm with Unimark (contact per fax is Cheryl Hartsell, phone#: 405-844-6200 ext. 228) or is this something I can do?

Mary, given where we are in the month I know that the payment details have already been established & that given the date that it is too late to process Oct production for payment today.

Stacey/Sharon: Please adjust the payment detail in Global so that the terms flow downstream to Unify for next month's production.

Also; Lisa, Mary, Stacey & Sharon - - - - how common are the requests for payment date adjustments? I'd assume (former life experience) that the larger producers or those who process royalty or related payments require payment on the 25th due to their responsiblities. If this is common - - - instead of repairing after the fact - - - - do we have a list of customers that we should automatically adjust the payment terms within Global & likewise to that of the GTC template?

Gerald - - - - Hi! I'm over here in Confirms now. What is your input on this issue or to that of the common occurrence? Also, as the 'new kid' - - - - are their any future protocols I should know of???


Thanks all!!!!

"ENRON COMPRESSION SERVICES DEAL","ISSUES: Counter party creditworthiness, reliability of power delivery, ability to procure replacement power.

Facts: NTEC has an all requirements G & T contract with Rusk. NTEC has contracted to provide firm power to RUSk for Enron's contract, barring force majeure. NTEC has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. 

REGULATORY OPTIONS	
1. Alternative Counterparty
(a)SWEPCO: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both RUSK and SWEPCO (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to RUSK, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Enron contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to SWEPCO, then SWEPCO could be an alternative counter party for the Enron contract instead of RUSK. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default.

(b). NTEC:  Enron can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with NTEC and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Enron and wholesaler, though title technically passes through NTEC. For instance, after the bids come in, Enron can enter into a 3 party arrangement with NTEC and the winning bidder. NTEC is a more substantial counterparty than RUSK and Enron can have recourse against NTEC in case of default.

2. Reliability/Replacement Power: 
(a). Enron can establish onsite DG as back up.

(b) If the DG is offsite, Enron can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over NTEC or SWEPCO's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid.

(c) Enron can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Enron contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through NTEC, because of its all requirements contract with RUSK.  However, if Enron substitutes power at market price for the NTEC power, Enron will bear the cost of the higher priced power. NTEC has a long term partial requirements contract with SWEPCO, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power.

3. Deregulation Options
(a) RUSK opts out of Deregulation: Senate Bill 7, Sec. 41.052, states  that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice ""retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction.""

Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Rusk's contract with NTEC, Enron can persuade Rusk to renegotiate that contract or buy NTEC out. Enron can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to RUSK.

(b) RUSK opts in to deregulation: Enron can persuade RUSK to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Enron guarantees to RUSK that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that RUSk can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues.

Questions: 
1. What are the terms and conditions of the contract between RUSK and NTEC, what are RUSK's termination or renegotiation rights; and 
2. What are the terms and conditions of the contract betweenNTEC and the wholesale supplier.

"RE: Keep Whole Language for Mariner","Gerald,

Thank you for the language and the short turn around you provided.  This is a great help.

Attached is the revised Keep Whole Language.  I assume this language would completely replace the Variance langauge that we currently insert in our GTCs and any Replacement Price Differential Language in our Pooling Point and Wellhead GTCs.  I.e. this will be the only measure of damages for these deals.  If this is not correct, let's discuss. 

Ellen,  This language would be the same language use for the W&T Offshore and Spinaker deals.  Is this correct Nelson?

Please review before sending out to make sure I have correctly captured your business deal.
