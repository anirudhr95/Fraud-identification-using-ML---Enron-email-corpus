	     Gerald,

	     Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
$129
	rate.
	     Below
	     you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
	matters
	     which
	     one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
	They're both
	     on
	     my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

	     I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
from
	SA.  I
	     estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
	right?)
	     We'll
	     actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
family
	from the
	     Valley will be there as well.

	     If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
at
	the
	     hotel
	     sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
wedding
	together
	     from
	     there.

	     In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
got
	him a
	     gift
	     yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

Jean, 

I'm on my way to Jakarta so it would probably be best to handle this by e-mail.  I don't have Gerald's e-mail address so would you please forward this to him.

Gerald, 

My reasons for striking the sentence are: 

1)  I couldn't figure out what it added to the prior sentence. 
2)  I'm concerned it negates Article 4, which states that, except as otherwise provided in the agreement, Confidential Information will only be used to evaluate, negotiate, and consummate proposed Transactions.  The stricken language could be interpreted to allow the use of the Confidential Information to acquire businesses, facilities, contract rights, etc.  

At a minimum, the stricken language should be modified to make it clear that a Party may not use Confidential Information received under this Agreement in pursuit of such activities.

Thanks for your comments.  I've made a few revisions (hightlighted in BLUE); in particular, I've clarified the Capital Expenditures Section 4 (we want to differentiate the transmission line from the remainder of the capital estimates).  We are still working on the items in red and in yellow.

One question for you in Section 8.  Why did you add the following sentence ""Oakhill would maintain ownership and responsibility for all maintenance of the reciprocating gas compressors throughout the contract term""?  Its not clear to me why we'd include a sentence on gas compression.  Let me know.

"FW: Assignment Letters","Robert,  The original contribution agreement called for Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. to acquire consent for these assignments.  They were required to use ""all reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents"".  To the extent they did not do so, ENA should not be liable for the $25,000 per month.  I assume Hugh Connett at Bridgeline is the proper person contact person at Bridgeline.  What is the current status of this $25,000 per month bill.  Has Bridgeline invoiced us?

I know that you are out until Wednesday, but I would be interested in the status of the Confidentiality Agreement within Marathon's legal department.

He also agreed that the Sentence In Section & on Page 10 which reads ""Text from here to the end of item 7 has been inserted by Enron North America Corp."" is a note which should be stricken.

Also for consistency sake, Section 3.2(B) in the main body of the agreement should not be stricken.  Exhibit A overrides this Section so the strike is not necessary in the main body of the Agreement.  

Lastly,  the full legal name ""Enron North America Corp."" should be inserted in the agreement.

	2.  General Counsel of ENA (Mark Haedicke)
	3.  Executive VP, Corp. Development of Enron Corp.
	4.  Anyone else that ENA requires to approve these non-compete agreements.

2.  We need to scrub how this will fit with EES' business in this area.

Per our discussion, you will find attached the letter that Jean is going to sign.  According to the numbers showed to me by Carol earlier this week, we should expect to book a gain of $356,447.59 as a result of doing this (calculations below).

Attached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO, LLC for ECS' election to take and make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup and Kachina.  As we discussed Chris, Section 5.03 of the LLC Agreement governs the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and upon provision of this notice, the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS.  Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is, the original notes will need to be cancelled.  Nora, can locate these originals.

I am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct.  I pulled these from the agreement.  Need to verify.

"Dow Invoice","I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following

1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000
    3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.

Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.

2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40
     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)

Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.

3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500

I find no basis for this in the contract.


Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	CA with Powder River Energy

Hey Gerald!

I finally got my computer back up.  The name of the utility is Powder River Energy Corporation - A Touchstone Energy Cooperative (I don't know if you need that last part or not).  The relationship is this:

ECS is acting as the agent on behalf of Crestone Energy Ventures, LLC to purchase power and deliver shaft horsepower.  We will be buying electricity strictly off of PRECORP's tariff.  We will also be providing the cash for PRE to build transmission to the compressor site.  Right now, the deal term is for 10 years, starting in May '02, but we will begin negotiations with them immediately.  

Last week I met with three people from PRECORP, just to begin the relationship, one of which was Clarence Moshier (Chief Operating Officer for PRECORP), who I spoke to again yesterday.  He said that they would have no problem signing a CA with us.  Basically, I just want to make sure that whatever we put in place with PRECORP cannot be relayed to Crestone by them.

Anything else you need?

Andrew

Gerald/Ellen

Please review & edit as necessary. If possible, once ""buffed to a shine"", I'd like to be able to insert this language into the GTC Confirm template above Notice information. This particular scenario is for Unimark LLC (deal #1146397).

Language Take 1:

Payment Terms:  As hereto agreed, payment by Buyer to Seller for gas received by Buyer during the preceding calendar month shall be made payable by wire transfer on the 25th Day of the Month following delivery. If the due date for any payment to be made under this Agreement is not a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be the following Business Day.


Please let me know as soon as possible as this is a Nov Production deal that has not yet been confirm & also due to the prior conversations Settlements, Judy, Lisa & Contracts has had with the CP.

Thank you!!!

Hey Gerald,

I was wondering if you can answer a question for me.  If you can't, no problem...

I recently completed a paper that compares electric compression to gas-fired compression.  I am presenting that paper next week at the Gas Machinery Research Council Annual Conference and Seminar.   I plan on submitting the paper to several industry journals in the hopes of getting it published.

How do I make sure the paper is protected from being copied by someone else and submitted under their own name?  Can I copyright the paper?

Thanks,

Andrew

"RE: Dudes...","Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, ""Where is this relationship headed?""  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  

Gerald

You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35"" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20"" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  

Gerald

You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35"" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20"" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

"Master Enfolio's","Alan,  Per our discussion, attached are drafts of Enron's Master Firm agreements.  Sorry for the delay.  

  

Enron's preference would be to use these master instead of the GISB agreements for the firm deals.  The Firm GTC were really meant as a stop gap until we could be these Masters in place.  I did review the GISB we currently have in place with Northern States Power (WI and MN).  These agreements do not have the necessary credit provisions and termination payment provisions required for firm deals that are included in our attached Master.  These Masters should address the specific concerns included in your email.

1.  The Masters contains provisions to deal wth the possibility that a price will not published on any day in the same manner as the GISB does.
2.  The netting issue we need to address.  The GISB don't have netting provisions, but we don't use GISB for any firm deals over 1 month in term.  I am not sure I understand the regulatory issues with respect to netting.  These Master contain netting provisions.  Let's discuss once you have reviewed the Masters.
3.  Force Majeure provisions are similar to the GTC.  Enron prefers a vary narrow definition of FM.  We modify the GISB FM to reflect this with special provisions.  If you could provide specific comments we can address your issues.
4.  Audit provisions are included in the Masters.
5.  Any affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions can be address in this Master.  If you could provide specific language we can address this issue.

Putting these Master in place would really make business going forward much more efficient.  Please review and let's discuss and your earliest convenience.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512.

Subject:	RE: Comments to O&M Agreement

Gerald,
My comments noted.  A few points:   as I read the contract, client is paying for the insurance cost of BCCKOP, and therefore should get full benefit of those policies, not just limited to claims attributable to BCCKOP's gross negligence/willful misconduct.  BCCKOP is in full control of the Facility and therefore should wear some financial risk for damage to it arising out of the Operating Services.  I have limited this to $100k per occurrence (our deductible for non-power gen assets is $1MM). I've also made them take deductibles under their policies for third party liability and employee injury risks (they had these on us originally), and specified that their GL cover include pollution legal liability (they had this on us also, but since it's a third party risk I think it should stay with the operator).
Call me if I've got this wrong or if we need to discuss further.   

Thx,

David

"RE: WFLA","Bill,  The contract itself does not have a confidentiality clause, but per Jeff Stone's email, Gulf does consider the contract proprietary information and does not want this info voluntarily disclosed at this time.  I forwarded the email to you earlier.

Concerning the emails etc., as I mentioned before, ECS has a copy of a Confidentiality Agreement that we executed by Gulf,  initialed by me as ECS attorney, but not signed by an officer of ECS.  Our business guys think we executed this agreement.  This CA would cover all information exchanged between Gulf and ECS.  I have asked Russell Badder's to check with Gulf to obtain an executed copy.  Nothing in the CA agreements prohibit me from disclosing the CA. So we could potentially provide the copy of the CA we have to John.  Obviously the correspondence between ECS and Gulf contains the commerical terms of our power deal as we negotiated with Gulf.  Given Jeff's email and the CA copy I have in hand, I would not want to disclose the emails and memo's without Gulf's explicit permission.  Let me know if you have any ideas on the best way to approach this with WFLA.

	     Gerald,

	     Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
$129
	rate.
	     Below
	     you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
	matters
	     which
	     one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
	They're both
	     on
	     my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

	     I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
from
	SA.  I
	     estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
	right?)
	     We'll
	     actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
family
	from the
	     Valley will be there as well.

	     If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
at
	the
	     hotel
	     sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
wedding
	together
	     from
	     there.

	     In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
got
	him a
	     gift
	     yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

"NNG Hubbard","Stuart,  I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements:

All these contracts are in Enron North America Corp.'s name

1.  Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one.  We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings.  NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement)  This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities.  No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  Thus it is not terminated.  If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year.  Term is through January 31, 2018.

2.  First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997.  NNG operates the electric driver for ENA.  Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater.  Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above.  Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period).  

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

3.  Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997.  ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative.  Term is through December 31, 2017.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

4.  Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995.  ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation. This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69.

	Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default.  GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default.  If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the ""Stipulated Loss Value"" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder.  The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement.

Let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements.

Hi Stacey,

Got a request from Darren in Credit, to change the status of the subject CP to non-trading.  When I made the change, I got the edit that indicates that 8 contracts are still active on the record, and the maintenance group is HOUGAS.  Per Darren, all trades should be under CP ID 55134, i/no/ Constellation Power Source, Inc.  I just want to make sure those can be moved if the record is in a non-trading status.

This is also flagged for EES, should that link and retail flag be added to the Constellation Power Source record, even though it is not known to be one of EES's customers at this time, or at least it hasn't been flagged as such at this time?  I also went in to make that change, but since you are working on those contracts, I wanted to run it by you first.

I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following

1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000
    3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.

Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.

2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40
     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)

Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.

3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500

I find no basis for this in the contract.


Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

	2.  The use of subtantially in Paragraph 2 seems redundant.  The notice requires reasonable detail.  To add subtantial compliance on top of that is redundant.

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Gerald,
I am researching several outstanding receivables from Bridgeline.  I am looking for the Schedules to Contribution Agreement, which is item 3 in the index of documents.  Do you know where I might obtain a copy?  Also, is there any type of brief available on these contracts.  I have seen one for ECS, so I was hoping that one might be available for Bridgeline.


Thanks for your help.

The permit application is set for public hearing on August 29 at 10:00
a.m. in Baton Rouge.  I will forward a copy of the public notice upon
receipt.  The purpose of the public hearing is to allow any interested
parties to make comments or present evidence on the application.  Joe
Ball prefers that Bridgeline not present any evidence or testimony at
the hearing.  Joe considers the application to be evidence of everything
needed to approve the permit.  Accordingly, I do not intend to present
any evidence at the hearing.  Our role will be to observe any comments
or protests by interested parties.  Joe Ball will advise if there are
any issues raised at the hearing that require a response and we can
supplement the record in writing.  This approach is preferable because
it does not subject anyone involved with the project to
cross-examination at the hearing and it affords us time to make an
informed and calculated response (if needed).

David and Robert: considering the importance of this project to your
respective companies, I would encourage you both to attend if possible.
I will defer to David as to whether Harry Allison should attend.

As a follow up to your discussion on Friday with Jill Zivley regarding the Aspect/Helmrich & Payne, et al dedicated lease contract #96055540, Jill asked me to coordinate with you to get the amendment to this contract prepared. Per my discussion with Jill, the following items need to be addressed in the amendment.

Add the new well
Change the working interest
Include a statement to address our timing for changing working interest to the month succeeding the month that we are notified
Extend the contract an additional year from the end of the contract term

I will bring you copies of the contract (including the assignment from Enron North America to ENA Upstream) as well as the working interest sheet as soon as I have them. Jill would like to have this contract completed this week since the well is expected to begin flowing any day.

If you have any questions or need anything else on this request, please let me know.

How should we confirm these deals?  We have language to confirm 2 pricing tiers.  

Judy how should we proceed to confirm these deals?  Should we start this trend of multiple pricing tiers for such small volumes?

Please let me know how we should proceed.

If she has availability, her and her husband will come out to the house and take a look.  You can go over with her what you want done and then agree on the price.

"ECS Sale of Gas","Jason,  To follow up on our discussion last week, Enron Compression Services Company (not a debtor, and owned 100% by ENA) is receiving physical gas under its Compression Services Agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company.  The gas is delivered to ECS on TW's system as consideration for ECS delivery of electric compression services.  This gas was sold by ECS to ENA under a long term Master Firm, but obviously that has blown up.  TW has been desperate to get this gas off of their system since it is packing their pipeline worse every day.  We put into place a GISB with Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd.  I made sure there was not cross affiliate netting language in the GISB.  Some of the gas was sold over the Christmas weekend (about 20,000 per day) and more is being sold this week.  We need to put into place a long term sale for the remainder of the term of the compression deals (approximately 7 years) to protect the compression services deals.  Sid may be a potential counterparty, but it may be sold to someone else.  Please provide any input you may have on how we need to structure this sale given the current situation.

Dear Fellow Diver:

Well, it's been a while, but we have been busy.  Here's a brief rundown on what's been happening.  In the United Kingdom PADI received some great exposure for the PADI Seal Team Program when the BBC's children television series Blue Peter did a whole segment on the Scouts in the UK taking up the Seal Team program.  Here is a link to the Scout website so you can learn more; http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/activity/outdoor/adventure/scubascout.htm

Speaking of the PADI Seal Team, they made an appearance in October at the Scuba Extasea Expo in Denver, Colorado, USA.  They were signing autographs and having a great time.  Shina, Blade, Kiros, Daria and Alano even had their pictures taken with real-life U.S. Navy Seals.  It was great.

By now, you should have received two special Fellow Diver newsletters inviting you to bring three friends into scuba diving and receive a $50.00 check from PADI.  I'm happy to report that the program is a big success!  The scuba industry at large is jumping on the bandwagon developing associated offers for those of you who show them your PADI check.  We will be doing our best to keep track of the many offers so that we can keep you informed.  Please keep checking the PADI website and be on the look out for more special newsletters.

I did receive quite a few e-mails about the PADI Diving Society.  Currently, there are two PADI Diving Societies. One is based in the US and the other is based in the UK and serves that region. The official publication of the PADI Diving Society in the US is Sport Diver magazine. I encourage you to visit their site at; www.sportdiver.com to learn more about Society membership and the magazine. And, PADI Diving Society members receive another $25.00 from Sport Diver when three friends or family members receive their PADI Open Water Diver certification. Sport Diver also has a great email newsletter you can receive for free. Just drop in and register online at http://www.sportdiver.com/idiver

The holidays are quickly sneaking up on us.  So what scuba-related gift can you give your friends or family?  Here is an idea.  We recently added cool post cards to the padi.com website.  One is a gift certificate for $10.00 off the PADI Open Water Diver course.  Send friends or family members the post card and when they follow the simple directions and complete the Open Water Diver course, they get $10.00 directly from PADI.  Just follow this link: www.padi.com/fun/postcard2  And don't forget to wish them happy holidays.  It's a nice gift that doesn't cost you a thing.

If you happened to be in the Cayman Islands the first week of November, you might have met Michelle.  ""She"" was the hurricane that came blowing through literally hours before PADI Diving Society's Total Submersion Event.  Despite this, Sunset House, a PADI Gold Palm Resort, and the event's host hotel did an incredible job of making everyone feel at home.

If you were at Total Submersion, you would have seen something unusual. Me diving next to a mermaid! That's right, I dove the Mermaid off Sunset House and have pictures to prove it!  Take a look at http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/mermaid/. Despite the initial bad weather, more than 70 people had a fabulous week.  Please consider joining us next year at this fantastic event.  Details will be posted on the PADI website as they become available.

I know this is getting a little long, so until next time, get a friend (or three) and go diving. And, drop me a line to let me know about your latest dive adventure.

Scope:  

The scope of this project is to analyze, develop and propose a compression services package that will optimally manage Encore's current and future horsepower requirements.  In order to do this we will need to explain our financial structures and gain access to information pertaining to their compression facilities and existing power agreements. 

Email me with the completed CA so that I can forward it on to the client.

Sent:	Thursday, November 08, 2001 3:55 PM

Cc:	Dolan, Sue
Subject:	ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreements with PSCo and CLF&P


Gerald,

At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company
such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referenced
Agreements for Public Service Company of Colorado (""PSCo"") and Cheyenne
Light, Fuel and Power (""CLF&P"").  I apologize for the delay.  Our comments
are as follows:

Public Service Company of Colorado Agreement

Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues.  We request in Section
4.1 that the $20,000,000 dollar level be applicable to each of our
companies.  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section
4.6 be $25,000,000 as to each of our companies.

2.4 Confirmations.  In the second line, please change ""may"" to ""shall"".  We
need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for
regulatory purposes.  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that
the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed
and returned, in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 2.21
Transactions.

3.5 Netting and 4.4. Offset.  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in
the normal course of business under these contracts.  Amounts due to and
from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes,
especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize if PSCo
or CLF&P acted as Seller to Enron in a Transaction.  Accordingly, we propose
that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the
parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited
to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering
Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the
Agreement.

4.1 Early Termination.  I am concerned that the date to be established for
termination of Transactions is without definition.  I would prefer to see
the language in subpart (i) modified to state that the Notifying Party may
""establish a date, which shall be not less than two (2) nor more than ten
(10) Business Days following the date of such notice.""

4.2 Triggering Event.  In the 8th line down, I don't understand the
inclusion of the phrase ""or deemed to be repeated"".  Unless I am missing
something, it doesn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.  Please
delete this phrase in the Agreement.

4.1 and 4.5 References to Affiliates.  In numerous places throughout the
Agreements and, in particular, in Sections 4.1 and 4.5, reference is made to
Affiliates.  For regulatory reasons, we cannot intermingle the account
status of our affiliated companies.  Moreover, neither PSCo nor CLF&P is
authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated.
Please delete all references to Affiliates of PSCo or CLF&P in the
respective Agreements.

Article 5. Force Majeure.  The language in this Article is not typical of
most Force Majeure provisions, which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure
for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the
ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period.  The language in
your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time
only, for a duration of up to 60 Days, after which time Force Majeure no
longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement.  In other
words, Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence
involving a separate and independent Transaction.  This is not acceptable.
We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard
Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments.

Section 8.1. Notices.  Prior to the language in the parenthetical, please
insert ""provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically"".

Section 8.2.  Transfer.  We would prefer that this language be revised to
the more traditional language requiring the consent (rather than approval)
of the other Party, ""which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld"".
Please modify this provision accordingly.

Section 8.3.  Limitation of Remedies.  We are in general agreement with this
provision, however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of
merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use.  The gas sold and purchased
under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the
ordinary use to which it is intended.  Please modify this Section
accordingly.

Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions.  The GISB
Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day
confirm deadline, rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition.  We
request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry
standard.

Definition of Material Adverse Change.  This definition needs to be expanded
beyond a review of the level of each company's credit rating.  Please
replace your definition with the following:

	""Material Adverse Change"" with respect to a Party means (i) any
downgrading of any unsecured, long-term senior debt of such Party 	or
any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit
support for the obligations of such Party (each such entity being a
""Credit Support Provider"" for such Party) such that such debt is
rated below ""BBB-"" or its equivalent by Standard & Poors or below
""Baa3"", or its equivalent, by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.; 	provided,
that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	any
unsecured, long-term, senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard &
Poors or Moody's Investor Services, Inc., then a 	Material Adverse
Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which, in the
reasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a material
adverse effect on the creditworthiness, 	financial responsibility, or
ability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider, as applicable, to
perform its obligations in connection 	herewith.

Definition of Replacement Price Differential.  Although we are in general
agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential, it seems
preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable, cost of
cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day
average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred.
Please modify your definition accordingly.

Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power Company Agreement

Our comments with respect to this Agreement are identical to those stated
above regarding the PSCo Agreement, with the following exceptions:

Section 4.2. Triggering Event.  The dollar levels near the end of the

$75,000,000.

Section 4.7.  Collateral Requirement.  Similarly, the dollar trigger levels
in this provision should be equivalent between our companies.  Please make
each $25,000,000.

Except for the foregoing, please make changes to the Cheyenne Agreement
consistent with our comments to the PSCo Agreement as set forth above.

Gerald:

Attached is my draft ""Purchase and Sale Agreement"" based on the form
used in Texas.  The following are the major revisions which I made:

1.  I put the property description in the body of the agreement.  It is
short enough and I find this prevents problems which occasionally come
up when using Exhibits.  I also added a blank for the municipal address
of the improvements.  This is required by Louisiana law, IF the property
has an address.

2.  In paragraph ""1""  and in the Act of Cash Sale, I added a reservation
of mineral rights.  If you are not concerned about this it can be taken
out.

3.  In paragraph ""3""  I added language specifically waiving buyer's
claims under the Louisiana laws of Redibition  which are specific legal
warranties.

4.  I changed paragraph ""5"" to limit buyer's indemnity to matters
arising after the closing date.

5.  In paragraph ""7""  I added a provision to allow the arbitrator to
order specific performance.  I also added provisions allowing the
parties to enforce the arbitrator's orders in court, and allowing the
parties resort to the courts for injunctive relief, if necessary.

6.  I added a provision for awarding attorney's fees in paragraph ""13"".

7.  I added paragraphs ""12"", ""14"", & ""15"" which are helpful boilerplate.

8.  I added Paragraph ""16"" to provide a drop dead date.  The length of
time is purely arbitrary.

Please call or e-mail me with any questions.

Would you like me to handle the closing also?

Mark,

The agreements you received are to cover the operating lease with the purchase option quoted for this transaction. Hanover will issue the contract whereby Hanover Compression Limited Partnership will be reflected as the Lessor and ECS will be the Lessee. Hanover will then assign the contract to GE whereby all monthly payments will be remitted to GE. Hanover will enter into a separate agreement to cover the maintenance and service portion of this transaction, of which Hanover shall invoice.

The documents forwarded to you are the actual documents you'll be require to execute however they will reflect Hanover as Lessor. Additionally, Hanover maintains all warranty obligations extended against the package regardless of the assignment to GE.

Please review the documents and advise of any exceptions or issues. Keep in mind that these documents are specifically for the monthly operating lease installments and that most of the language is required to comply with the FASB Accounting regs. which keep this transaction as an operating lease/off balance sheet transaction. This is a standard agreement we utilize with other companies seeking operating leases with purchase options while maintaining an off balance sheet transaction.

I'd be glad to visit with you or anyone from your office if necessary to clarify any questions or concerns.



>>> ""Knippa, Mark"" <Mark.Knippa@ENRON.com> 06/22/01 03:52PM >>>

Not sure I get the picture.  ECS is expecting to have an Operating Lease with Hanover that accommodates the new compressor station (equipment, packaging & installation).  ECS is also expecting to enter into a Maintenance Services Agreement with Hanover that covers the provided equipment and installation, bumper to bumper, for the 10 year term of the agreement.

What has been provided is blank documentation from GE Capital that requires maintenance services, delivery, use & operation, insurance, the return of equipment, etc. that does not fit the parameters of our discussions with Hanover.  Is ECS
expected to execute the agreements with GE Capital or with Hanover?  Is the Hanover Agreement expected to mirror this agreement 	less the services that Hanover is being hired to perform?

Afternoon,
    I was able to go through Colorado Springs financials, but was unable to distinguish between natural gas system operations and the general ""utility"", outside of book value of the various gas, electric and water plants.  As such, if we are unable to acquire statements for the gas system itself, I don't think we can agree to CSU's redline of Scope of Agreement (point # 1 below).

Max,  The agreement calls for them to provide to ENA certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ENA under this agreement.  A letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient.  To the extent they don't provide this, an Early Termination event occurs.  We can still call for collateral in accordance with Section 4.5 if they don't meet the thresholds.  The item added in your Sentence #1 below does concern me.  This seems to be a floated revenue system and I am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there.  I need to review these additions with Colorado Springs, because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements.  We probably need to get on a conference call with them.
 
I am probably OK with the arbitration provision, depending on how the other items turn out.
 
Tyrell,  do you want to set something up a call with Marcus and his attorney to discuss these issues?

A couple of thoughts regarding the redline:
 
1) Scope of Agreement: ..""judgement resulting from this Agreement shall be made only from the revenues received from Customer's natural gas system operations..""  I need to re-review the financials to determine how much the gas system operations is worth.  Because of this clause, $15mm in credit may be too much.  Once I can get on the net, I'll review.
 
2) Scope of Agreement:  ""Furthermore, in accordance with the Colorado Springs City Charter, performance of Customer's obligations.....expressly subject to appropriation of funds for such purpose by the City Council.""  In case we are in a position to call for margin, what is the process of getting it?  Do they have to get permission / authorization from the city, etc..? Tyrell had asked me the process how we call and what we accept for margin, but I'd like to understand the ease and/or difficulty of receiving margin from them.  We may never hit the threshold, but if we do and we can't get margin, we may have a big problem.  
 
3) Gerald, I assume you're ok with the arbitration clauses?  
 
Give me a call if anyone wants to discuss further.

Ellen,  This language would be the same language use for the W&T Offshore and Spinaker deals.  Is this correct Nelson?

"RE: Louisiana Resource License information","Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:

	1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000.
	2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.
	3.  I don't know.  I don't think that any of the licenses were new after the transaction date.  Robert, any different info?
	4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.  Do you agree, Robert?

To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's 40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these licenses has been filed.  

Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  LRC is still held 100% by Enron North America Corp.

Subject:	RE: Louisiana Resource License information

Gerald, this is just to follow up on our prior phone conversations re: the
sale of Louisiana Resources' assets (including licenses) to Bridgeline .  As
I mentioned, what is important to our inquiry is whether transfer of
applications were filed prior to the consummation of the above transaction
whereby the assets of Louisiana Resources' were acquired.  I will need the
following transaction information:

*	When did the transaction close?  The exact date. 2/?/2000
*	Which licenses where part of that transaction?
*	Which licenses were obtained by filing a new application after the
transaction date?
*	Which stations are constructed/operating?

As a reminder, we are under a deadline to get this information to the FCC.
To make the deadline I will need the information by tomorrow or Monday at
the latest.  Please call/email with any questions.

Thanks and have a Happy Thanksgiving.

               Sounds cool.  My mom gave me her guitar a few months ago so
   I
         bought
            a
               fingering chart book (if that's what it's called - i don't
      know)
               yesterday.
               Learning guitar - This is my new project.  How long have you
      been
               playing?

               Nothing real exciting.  After Thursday, I was a little burnt
   so
      I
            stayed
               home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends
   house.
      He
            plays
               the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session
      (or
         at
               least
               we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday
   I
         went
               furniture shopping and purchased a couch for my house.  I
   got
         kinda
            of
               sick
               of have no furniture in my living room. Now my house won't
   seem
      so
               pathetic
               when people visit.

               Yea, I have been to Teala's.  Can't say I have ever had the
      mango
               margarita
               though.  I will have to try when I get a chance.  Sounds
      fruity!!

                  Hey Gerald!!  The weekend was good.  I went to a wedding
   on
            Saturday,
                  but I
                  was bored almost all day Sunday.  My boyfriend and I
   finally
         went
            to
                  Teala's (Houston's answer to Baby A's) for Ritas.  If
   you've
         never
               tried
                  it
                  - Mango would be my recommendation.  Sorry I missed you
   and
         your
               friends
                  on
                  Thursday.  I wimped out Thursday and Friday - pretty
      pathetic.
            But I
                  give
                  you props just for considering GK 2 weeks in a row!!  Did
      you
         do
                  anything
                  fun?

                  Hi Jennifer,  How was your weekend?  Did you do anything
         exciting?
            I
                  was
                  invited to go with some friends to the GK on Friday
   night,
      but
         I
               thought
                  that two Fridays in a row would be pushing my luck, so I
      begged
            off.

Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, ""Where is this relationship headed?""  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  

Gerald

You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35"" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20"" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

1.  The replacement of Section 3.1 and 3.2 with Section (a), (b), etc.  is confusing, but unfortunately the September 1, 2000 amendment already made this replacement.  I am  staying with that format.

2.  Since the Original Agreement was awkardly amended in September of 2000, I think the references to the ""Original Agreement as amended by Amendment #2"" are helpful, so l retained them.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I am OK to send this to Dow if you are.

Gerald:

    I have been contacted by Kim Torres of the Assumption Parish Police
Jury.  She has some questions and concerns about the Purchase & Sale
Agreement, to wit:

1).  They want to add warranty language to ? 4 as follows:

    Seller warrants that it is the record title owner to the property
being sold, and warrants it has good and merchantable title, free of any
and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
buyer for the same.

    Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that
persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding
authority to do so.

I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor
revisions which I will do.

2).  They are concerned about the warranty language which covers
hazardous wastes in ? 4.  They tell me that they have not done an
environmental inspection of the property.  They want to know if there
have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on
the property.  They are looking for something in writing that no such
sources existed.

3).  Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31,
1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to
Louisiana Resources Co., Inc.  Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc.  I
have not done a title exam so I cannot explain this discrepancy.

4).  She gave me the physical address of the property and the name of
the Police Jury President which I will insert in the documents.

Please contact me to discuss our response to these concerns.

Keith

I just finished visiting with Mark Knippa about Enron Compression Services.  It probably makes sense to get together with you and someone on the bankruptcy team to talk about how we should handle all of the deals in ECS.  Can we set something up for Wednesday?  I have asked Mark to put together deal structure charts and explanations so that we have something to present to the bankruptcy lawyers for consideration at this meeting.  I would ask that you work with him to verify the accuracy of those charts/explanations.

Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:

     1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000.
     2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are
currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.
     3.  I don't know.  I don't think that any of the licenses were new
after the transaction date.  Robert, any different info?
     4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you
forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.
Do you agree, Robert?

To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They
were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's
40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these
licenses has been filed.

Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the
licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into
Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  LRC is still held 100% by Enron North America
Corp.

"RE: Unocal Term Sheet","I have reviewed the term sheet and I am fine with the form.  

I did spot a potential issue with the Transport piece of the proposal.  If ENA holds transport on NNG, it cannot simply sell use of that capacity to Unocal.  The shipper of record with NNG needs to hold title to the gas that is being transported.  For Unocal to utilize this capacity, they would need to either directly contract with NNG for such capacity, or ENA would acquire the capacity then ""Capacity Release"" the capacity to Unocal.  The Capacity Release would be subject to NNG bulletin board posting requirements.    Let me know if you want to discuss further.

Since ENA can not directly provide firm transport on NNG, I would rephrase it as ""ENA would arrange for Firm Transport on NNG"".  As we discussed before, Unocal would need to enter directly into the FT with NNG or ENA would have to contract for the FT and then release it to Unocal pursuant to the capacity release procedures (which would include posting and bidding requirements).

Still trying to recharge the girlfriend pipeline on the weekends.  Kinda of in a dry spell right now.  Oh well at least my life isn't complicated.  Glad to hear things are going well for you.  Yes the days of surfing Longhorn boards for 3 to 4 hours a day are over.  

I am really getting comfortable with our DTs actually.  Maurice Gordon, even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc. He crushed Curry in the endzone for the safety.  Sounds likes Tubbs is picking up the double teams (ala Casey Hampton) which allows Gordon more room to work.  He is very quick and can get to the backfield quickly.  

Mark my words, Derrick Johnson is our best linebacker Now!!!  Watching him against NC was a joy.  He toys with the lineman and makes them look silly when he jukes and blows past them.    The guy needs to be starting now.  I know he has only played two games, but I haven't seen a more talented linebacker play at UT since I began watching Longhorn football.

The game against UH is national on ESPN2, I believe.  You should be able to catch it.  Watch #11 on Defense.  Look for me in the stands.  I be the one wearing burnt orange.

turn.  I am not jazzed about the winters here.

I have been keeping of with the horns (of course) a little from up here.
The UNC game was televised here and I think UofH is on ESPN2, I just don't
know whether it is regional or not.  I agree with you on the analysis.  We
are strong on defense and special teams (surprisingly so on special teams),
but I still worry about our DTs.  Offense is stagnant and I continue to wait
for them to get on the same page.  We have soooooo much potential there.

I haven't been to a Michigan game yet.  We missed Miami Ohio and I don't
think Lyd and I are going to got to the Eastern Michigan game this weekend.
We will certainly be going to the Big 10 games though.

Let me know how things are going when you have a chance.  Ironically, I am
busier now then I think I ever was at Enron.  I feel like I am constantly
behind the curve.

Talk to you soon.

Rude Dog,  How is it going?  Enjoying every moment of marital bliss!!
Must be weird to be a student again and have to do all that studying and
drink all that beer.

The Horns are looking pretty good.  The defense has really been
spectacular as well as special teams.  The offense is sputtering right
now, but I think they will get back on track.  I am going to the UH game
this weekend.  We had better put a whipping on them. But with Texas you
never know.  Gone to any Michigan games yet?

"FW: Enron GISB sent 4/5//01 Re: Northern States Power Minnesota;  Enf	olio confirms sent for PSCo and CLF&P","
Alan,  With respect to the Transactions for Cheyenne and Public Service Company, Enron prefers to use the Firm General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement for these deals.  These two transactions are 3 month firm deals.  The GISB is not set up for firm transactions longer than 1 month in term.  There is no termination payment provision in a GISB and Enron requires this language for any firm deal.  Enron's general policy is not to use the GISB for any firm deal that is longer than 1 month. I would be happy to discuss this further at your convenience.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512.

Debra,

I started to review the above-referenced GISB sent by you to Jeff Spector on
April 5, 2001, and realized that we already have a GISB in place between
NSP-MN and Enron Capital & Trade Resources.  Is it necessary to prepare
another GISB with the Enron North America entity, or can there be an
assignment of the Enron Capital & Trade Resources Agmt.  Please advise.

In addition, I called you earlier this week and left a message concerning
the Transaction confirmations you recently prepared for Public Service
Company of Colorado and Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power, which utilized the
Enfolio General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement.  Our preference
would be to instead structure these Transactions under GISB Agreements with
each of these utilities.  Please advise if this is acceptable and, if so, I
will prepare GISB Agreements, along with our Special Provisions page, and
send them to you for review.

I look forward to your reply.

Subject:	tpa - Section 7 issue

    

      Donna Greif has asked me to initiate tpas with about 20 to 22 pipes for the two EES companies.   I am sure that Tennessee and  EPNG will again
      raise the same issue as they did with the language in Section 7 when we initiated tpas for ENA and  ENA Upstream.  
      In order to maintain consistency, should I remove the line referencing the 3.2B omission?

      The tpa between EPNG and ENA does not have this line item.
      The tpa between Tennessee and ENA as well as between Tennessee and ENA Upstream does not have this either.
      
      Mojave also has the same issue with this, they are refusing to sign the tpa with us for ENA.

      These are all EL Paso owned pipes.

      I have already contacted someone at Tennessee, and they want the exact same language as the previous tp agreements.
      

    Thanks

Mark,

The agreements you received are to cover the operating lease with the purchase option quoted for this transaction. Hanover will issue the contract whereby Hanover Compression Limited Partnership will be reflected as the Lessor and ECS will be the Lessee. Hanover will then assign the contract to GE whereby all monthly payments will be remitted to GE. Hanover will enter into a separate agreement to cover the maintenance and service portion of this transaction, of which Hanover shall invoice.

The documents forwarded to you are the actual documents you'll be require to execute however they will reflect Hanover as Lessor. Additionally, Hanover maintains all warranty obligations extended against the package regardless of the assignment to GE.

Please review the documents and advise of any exceptions or issues. Keep in mind that these documents are specifically for the monthly operating lease installments and that most of the language is required to comply with the FASB Accounting regs. which keep this transaction as an operating lease/off balance sheet transaction. This is a standard agreement we utilize with other companies seeking operating leases with purchase options while maintaining an off balance sheet transaction.

I'd be glad to visit with you or anyone from your office if necessary to clarify any questions or concerns.



>>> ""Knippa, Mark"" <Mark.Knippa@ENRON.com> 06/22/01 03:52PM >>>

Not sure I get the picture.  ECS is expecting to have an Operating Lease with Hanover that accommodates the new compressor station (equipment, packaging & installation).  ECS is also expecting to enter into a Maintenance Services Agreement with Hanover that covers the provided equipment and installation, bumper to bumper, for the 10 year term of the agreement.

What has been provided is blank documentation from GE Capital that requires maintenance services, delivery, use & operation, insurance, the return of equipment, etc. that does not fit the parameters of our discussions with Hanover.  Is ECS
expected to execute the agreements with GE Capital or with Hanover?  Is the Hanover Agreement expected to mirror this agreement 	less the services that Hanover is being hired to perform?

Subject:	RE: Construction Expedition Letter

Gerald,

Attached are my edits to the letter. Daphne will prepare a version that is
without all of the deletions and additions so it is easier to read. You can
compare the two to see exactly what I have done.

My edits are in blue. Comments are in bold blue and bracketed.

ECS may be over the barrel here and this may be the best deal that you can
get. But it isn't a deal because it is all illusory.

They agree to try to complete construction by a date certain (no recourse if
they don't) in exchange for an ECS guarantee to reimburse Gulf for an amount
that they think is fair (that is the only standard - they have no
responsibility justify and we have no ability to verify that amount).

In general, Gulf is allowed contributions in aid of construction and can
stop construction if they don't get it. If our existing agreements clearly
provide for a guaranteed term and minimum load, and those provisions are
linked to the costs of construction (so no further contribution from ECS was
contemplated in those agreements), then I think that ECS can hold them to
the deal.

We have no contract with WFEC so if the PSC decides in their favor we may
have to petition the PSC and ask that we not be financially damaged by their
decision and Gulf's incorrect representation (upon which we relied) that our
facility was in a territory that they could serve. I think (but have not
researched the point) that ECS would have standing as a customer. I believe
that the commissioners and their non lawyer staff would be sympathetic to
our situation.

However, if we agree to a capped amount of reimbursement then their may be
no issue for the PSC to decide. As of now Gulf has changed the deal on ECS.
If ECS accepts the change (unless under protest) then a court or the
commission will probably consider the matter moot. I'm not sure about the
legal effect of ""signing under protest"" in this context but can do some
research if you think that useful.

In any event I think that the letter should recite more of the history of
this negotiation and the early agreements or representations that are now
modified. I know our clients hate lawyers but we should try to have as clean
a record as possible if we think that we may have to seek relief. I don't
have any of the agreements at issue here and there is probably more that
should be included in the letter to give the context in which it is written
and signed.

More later. Call when you can.

Bill

Gerald:

I am attaching the following documents for your review:

1).  Purchase and  Sale Agreement,

2)  Draft of the body of a letter from LRCI to the Police Jury

I have revised the Purchase and Sale Agreement to add the language to
the suggested by Kim Torres (in ? 4) and to add Louisiana Resources,
Inc. and Louisiana Resources, L.P. as intervenors in the Cash Sale to
quitclaim the property to the Police Jury to solve the title problem.

Please contact me upon receipt to discuss and to fill in the blanks.

Keith

	3.	Not an Option.  This is not an option, but it is an executory contract to buy and sell and it shall be so construed in all respects.  No Party may withdraw from this Agreement all Parties grant unto each other and reserve unto themselves the absolute right to demand specific performance of this Agreement.

	4.	Warranties by Seller.  Seller's interest in and to the Subject Property is and will be transferred to and accepted by Buyer ""AS IS, WHERE IS"" AND IN ITS PRESENT CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR.  BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SELLER HAS NOT MADE, AND SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE CONDITION OR QUALITY OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW NOW OR HEREAFTER IN EFFECT, AND ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

	5.		INDEMNITIES.   BUYER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, REIMBURSE AND HOLD SELLER, ITS PARENT AND AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE ""SELLER GROUP"") FREE AND HARMLESS FROM ANY COSTS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES (WHETHER ON ACCOUNT OF PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH OR ON ACCOUNT OR PROPERTY DAMAGE) OR CAUSES OF ACTION AND LOSSES OF WHATSOEVER NATURE (INCLUDING ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COURT COSTS) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR IN ANY WAY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY, ON OR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH COSTS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, CAUSES OF ACTION OR LOSSES ARE DUE TO SELLER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

In addition, the transfer of the Subject Property or a subsequent change in the use of the property may result in the imposition of an additional tax plus interest as a penalty for the transfer of the change in the use of the land. Buyer acknowledges that there shall be no proration for, and Buyer shall be responsible for, payment of any ""roll back"" taxes or any other redetermination of property taxes assessed or relating to the year of the closing and years preceding the year of closing due or based upon any change in the use of the Subject Property at and after the closing hereunder.

Any dispute relating to this Agreement shall be resolved by binding, self-administered arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (""AAA"") and all such proceedings shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.  A single arbitrator shall be selected under the expedited rules of the AAA.  Only damages allowed pursuant to this Agreement may be awarded and the arbitrator shall have no authority to award consequential, treble, exemplary or punitive damages of any type under any circumstances regardless of whether such damages may be available under Louisiana law. The arbitrator shall have the power to award the remedy of specific performance. The results of such arbitration shall be conclusive and binding, provided, however, that both Parties shall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such equitable relief as is necessary to preserve and enforce their rights under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, either Party may join the other Party to any action, suit or proceeding with respect to which the Party seeking such joinder is a defendant, if the other Party is required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless such defendant in accordance with the terms of the provisions hereof.   Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having a jurisdiction hereof.

8.		Entirety and Severability.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties related to the purchase and sale of the Subject Property.  There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations (whether oral or written) affecting the Subject Property other than those herein expressed.  In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been herein contained.

9.		Governing Law.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED UNDER AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA AND FEDERAL LAW AS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 7 ABOVE.

10.		Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement, and all of the terms and provisions hereof, shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto, and their respective successors and assigns.

	12.	Further Assurances.  Each Party agrees that it will promptly perform all other acts and execute and deliver all other documents as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

	13.	Attorney's Fees.  In the event of the commencement of an arbitration proceeding or a breach of any of the provisions contained herein by either Party, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to collect from the other Party, as part of its damages for said breach, reasonable attorneys' fees associated with enforcing or defending any provision hereof.

	14.	Amendments. This Agreement may be modified or amended only in writing signed by both Parties which expressly refers to this Agreement and states an intention to modify or amend it.  No such amendment or modification shall be effected by use of any purchase order, acknowledgment, invoice or other form of either Party and in the event of conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any such form, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

	15.	Waiver.  A waiver by either Party of a breach of any of the terms of this Agreement by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of the terms of this Agreement.  The failure of any Party to insist upon strict performance of any provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right under it shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.

	16.	Termination.  This Agreement shall expire and shall be of no further force or effect Ninety (90) days from the Effective Date unless prior to such time the Parties have entered into an act of Cash Sale transferring the Subject Property from the Seller to the Buyer.

"RE: Gas Purchase Contract (Draft)","Nelson,  I reviewed the form provided.  Some comments	

1.  Generally we should make every attempt to get these guys to use our paper.  From an ENA Upstream overall standpoint, if we start using other forms then we lose consistency with how these deals are administered (payment, noms., etc).  

2.  With respect to this form there are some conceptual issues.
	A.  No specific measures of damages if the parties breach
	B.  No detail on the type of gas being purchase (i.e. Wellhead, Pooling Point, firm, interruptible)  Contract states that ""Seller shall use reasonable efforts to deliver 	and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to purchase"". We would have to tie this down.
	C.  Nomination deadlines and notification for production variances is not addressed.

3.  There are also some legal issues;  State Law, Arbitration, etc., Indemnity

In summary, we would have to make significant revisions to this form and it would end up looking much more like our form.  I don't know the dynamics of the relationship.  Are they insistent on using their paper?

"Discussion Drafts for Oakhill and Bay Gas","Mark,  Attached are rough drafts of the following documents for the noted projects:

Bay Gas Storage
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft Lease Agreement
3.  Draft O&M Agreement

   

Oakhill
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft O&M Agreement for Hanover to provide maintenance.

  

Please note that these are really rough based on the limited information available at this time.  I did not provide a lease agreement for Oakhill as you indicated Hanover would finance/lease the Electric Motor Drivers to ECS.  If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be used.  If Hanover is providing a purchase option, the lease agreement would need to be modified for the purchase option.  My suggestion is to provide these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are fine tuned, these drafts will be modified.  But this gives them the basic idea.   In my absence please contact Barbara for coordination of legal support in the event you cannot wait until I return.  Thanks.

Gerald:  I have already completed #1. On #2, they just want some
assurance that the property has never had underground storage tanks or
other hazardous waste sources on it.  I believe a letter from LRCI
stating that to its knowledge there have been no such sources on or
under the Property would suffice.  As far as #3, my abstractor has
promised to complete this limited title search today.  I hope to hear
from him tommorrow.

This agency agreement is El Paso's form and must be executed by ENA, Mexicana, and El Paso.  The El Paso form requires that you open as a read only file.
Please review.

  

We are working on the gas purchase agreement and should forward shortly.

We received the power of attorney and bylaws you emailed.  I had a Spanish speaking attorney in our office assist me with their review.  The bylaws look fine. We would like you to follow up with a certified copy in the mail.   For now can you confirm via a response to this email, that these are the latest bylaws on file?  

 He noted that under the Power of Attorney, it would be required that two of the gentlemen listed on page 2 of the power of attorney documentation, execute our agreements.  Can you confirm?  Would be happy to discuss this with you.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject:	Organizational Announcement


It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.

"RE: TW - Physical Gas Delivery for Dec.01","I don't think there would be any problem with the ECS selling the gas to a third party.  They are currently selling the gas to ENA.  I am not sure how the proceeds from the sale will be handled once ECS recieves them, since ECS is not bankrupt.  I will see if I can find anything out about that.  Eric, you might want to check with Ed and see if he has any insight.

Subject:	TW - Physical Gas Delivery for Dec.01



Eric,
We need to get the physical gas delivery issue resolved.  TW is scheduled to deliver to ECS which was contracted
with ENA for a fixed price for each of the stations ( [Bisti & Bloomfield or Kachina] and Gallup ).  The total volume
for Dec.01 according to TW and my best determination at this time is 342,560 MMBtu which ENA has not scheduled 
reportedly because they do not have a counter-party that will transact.  

This gas volume and the resulting cash flow into ECS Compression Co. LLC is a large portion of the monthly cash
flow required to fund the billing expenses.  

Gallup Sta. - 81,605 mmbtu's (Annual Charge Conversion) appears to be a $2.35/mmbtu price for this year
                   25,521 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge) appears to be a $2.44/mmbtu price for the term
	     107,126 mmbtu's for the month with a resulting $2.37144/mmbtu blended price

Bloomfield - 110,240 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge for Oct. power billed in Nov. 01)


Bisti -         125,194 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge for Oct. power billed in Nov. 01)
                  342,560 mmbtu's for the month of Dec. to ECS

I'm not 100% sure of the pricing on these transactions but possibly with your information and Gerald Nemec's
input we can determine and confirm.



TK Lohman at TW called with a buyer for the Dec. 01 ECS gas.  Scott Walker w/ Richardson Products 817 810 9385
frequently buys TW's operational gas that is sold intra month.  The most direct method of handling the gas is to have
ENA sell the gas & the proceeds directly flow back to ECS (if that is possible).  ECS doesn't want the gas sale to 
roll into the ENA bankruptcy process.  Otherwise ENA would need to assign ECS the ability to sell the gas directly
but ECS would then need to execute a TW Pooling Agreement (or something) and there may be issues with ECS
marketing gas directly.  

Let me know what blanks you can fill in.

Brent, 
Everything looks fine from Credit's standpoint, but I forgot to mention one Enron Entity. Please add ENA Upstream Company, LLC to the list of companies covered. This entity will transact Physical Natural Gas, possibly with all 3 Duke Entities. Sorry about any confusion that this might cause.

At your request I have attempted to put together a format for the Enron Corp. Guaranty covering multiple Enron Entities and three Duke entities for financial gas, physical gas and other products to be defined.  When we have finalized what we want this form to look like I will create the corresponding Duke Guaranty.  

Darren, do we have any outstanding Enron Corp. Guaranties that this guaranty will supercede?

John and Jeff, can you fill in the descriptive ""Whereas"" clauses relating to the Enron entities and products that you handle?  Please call me if you have any questions on what we are trying to do with this document.

Brent,
I spoke with Lisa Herman late Thursday and proposed the multi-product/mulit-affiliate grty. She seemed excited and ""encouraged,"" but wanted an additional entity added, Duke Energy Field Services, LP.  This entity will only comduct PHYSICAL business. Let mw know what I can do to help speed along the process.

Gerald,

The Upstream group is doing a considerable amount of repeat business with several customers. There is an increasing need to execute Master agreements with these customers. 

We would like to begin the development of a Master Wellhead contract that includes the same type of provisions that our Upstream GTC contracts include such as tolerances, keep whole, nomination deadlines, etc. Can you please let me know if you see any issues with changing the Master Firm contract to accomodate the Upstream business or if there is anything else that you may need from us to begin creating this Upstream Master?

Thanks,
Judy

If you have not already contacted someone about CLE credit for Thursday,  please send an e-mail to Becky Zikes stating that you attended the Thursday session.  This will enable you to claim 3.50 hours total credit, with 1.25 hours ethics credit for Thursday.  If you have any questions, please contact Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103.   Please respond by Thursday, May 31 since we need to finalize our CLE filings with the various state bar organizations. 


If you wish to receive CPE credit (for certified public accountants) for the Law Conference, please  send an e-mail to Becky Zikes and we will get the appropriate certificate prepared.  Again, any questions should be directed to Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103. 

Thanks for your help.

Gerald, the ILL. atty. Chris Hilgert referred to is Chris Townsend -His number is 312-368-4039. The specific question is: can we utilize Com Ed for E service at Nicor's ""Troy Grove"" Facility? (Located near Troy Grove, ILL- approx 10 Miles North of the Town of La Salle, ILL) The Com Ed substation we would like to have power delivered at is approx 7 Miles N. of the facility near the town of Mendota, ILL.  

Notes: 1) Nicor does not currently have an ILL Power service drop.(They are totally self gen.) 
           2) We would build line up to Com Ed and buy at the substation.

Subject:	Flights - Houston to Myrtle Beach

Hey guys.  I went to Expedia.com and found the Delta Flights Referenced below for $226/person.  This is still a really good deal and I would jump all over it if I were you.  Here are the flights:

Friday, August 24 Delta #4516 IAH to ATL (departs 10:10am, arrives 1:15pm)
		   Delta #4107 ATL to MYR (departs 2:55pm, arrives 4:36pm)

Sunday, August 26 Delta #4684 MYR to ATL (departs 11:40am, arrives 12:55pm)
		     Delta #2063 ATL to IAH (departs 3:50pm, arrives 4:56pm)

For those of you who don't know how to use Expedia.com.  Just go to the website (www.expedia.com) , search flights from Houston to Myrtle Beach on the above dates and select the flights that work best for you.  You can input your frequent flier number and pay online via credit card.

Good luck and let me know if I can help at all.

Bruce

PS - If you can schedule your flights at the same time, you can share a rental car out of Myrtle Beach, SC as well.  It is about a 40 mile drive north to Ocean Isle, NC . . . site of the wedding.

	Generally there has been a gas sales agreement with ENA.  Given that this transaction was done as ENA, it may have been handled

Subject:	NNG Hubbard

Stuart,  I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements:

All these contracts are in Enron North America Corp.'s name

1.  Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one.  We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings.  NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement)  This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities.  No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  Thus it is not terminated.  If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year.  Term is through January 31, 2018.

2.  First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997.  NNG operates the electric driver for ENA.  Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater.  Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above.  Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period).  

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

3.  Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997.  ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative.  Term is through December 31, 2017.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

4.  Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995.  ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation. This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69.

	Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default.  GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default.  If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the ""Stipulated Loss Value"" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder.  The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement.

Let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements.

Subject:	Schedule For Territorial Dispute



Gerald,

See the attached schedule for Docket 010441, the Gulf/WFEC dispute.

There is no schedule yet for the Gulf rate hearing. We expect that in early
October and I will forward it to you.

You asked about the effect of intervention in the rate case on the
territorial dispute. In addressing this question it is useful to know that
the FPSC rate hearing intervention rules are very liberal        (Enron can
intervene at any time) and that the rate case will not proceed rapidly. For
procedural purposes, a prompt intervention decision is not necessary.

Also, I think that Gulf has the stronger position in the territorial
dispute. Because an Enron intervention in the rate case could confuse the
staff and raise questions from WFEC, I think it best from ECS's perspective
to await a decision in the territorial dispute before petitioning for
intervention.



I've reviewed the questions in Harry Kingerski's e-mail that you forwarded.
Preliminarily, I note two corrections. First, we expect a decision in the
territorial dispute in early December, not November. Second, Harry said
that;

      ""Gulf proposed surcharge treatment for the capital costs of Smith
earlier this year, but eventually withdrew the application because the PPA
it was trying to get in place, whereby Southern would take ownership of the
plant and sell energy and capacity back to Gulf, drew a lot of flack"".

I don't know if it matters, but Susan Clark was told that Gulf withdrew the
application because the discovery order in the docket would have required
the release of Southern Company strategic planning material that Southern
considered very confidential. Withdrawal was preferable to disclosure. (I
recognize that this may be only Gulf's ""spin"" on the withdrawal and they may
have withdrawn for exactly the reason Harry suggests.)

The strategic questions posed in Harry's e-mail are complex and involve more
than one Enron entity. His questions defy a prompt response, at least from
us. We suggest that it would be useful to convene a meeting in Houston,
including us and a representative from each wholly-owned and potentially
affected Enron entity. That would facilitate the development and
handicapping of a regulatory stance that is best for Enron. Susan's
experience as a Florida Commissioner for nine years (and General Counsel for
years before that) is useful in understanding the factors that inform
staff's recommendations as well as a Commissioner's decisions in this
context. (I've attached Susan's information.)

Let me know what you would like us to do.

Bill

Rakhi,

Mary Ogden found and has provided Eva Rainer the missing documentation relevant to your Item 2; I believe Eva has already provided Texas Brine what is needed to clear up confusion relative to the various Enron entity transfers that took place prior to LRCI's conveyance to Texas Brine.

As to Item 1, I would ask that you work with Gerald Nemec of the EWS legal department.  He's been overseeing the Napoleonville work and will be able to oversee and work with Keith Daigle and Roger Westbrook on the Crawfish Right-of -Way work.

I have recently joined the Enron Industrial Markets legal team and am divesting of all my former Gas Assets and Trading work.  Gerald can be reached at 3-3512.

Steve,

I was hoping you could help me with the following two issues.  I am not sure who in legal is working on these.  

1) Crawfish Right-of-Ways (counterparty:  Bridgeline) - Bridgeline is requesting ROWs/easements on the Crawfish land in LA.  Keith Daigle, I suppose, is the one who would be actually drafting the agreements.  Roger Westbrook recently received the plats and general descriptions which are to be attached to the agreements.  Would you know the status on these documents?    

2) Napoleonville (counterparty: Texas Brine) - Texas Brine purchase approximately 16.6 acres from Enron at the Napoleonville Salt Dome earlier this year.  Texas Brine is attempting to clear title for this land.  The executed documents from the sale of the land from Enron Storage Co to Bridgeline Storage Co and then from Bridgeline Storage Co to LRCI.  were apparently never filed at the courthouse.  Texas Brine is very eager to get this cleared up.  Do you know whether Legal has these documents?    

Thanks for your help,

Rakhi

OK folks, here's an update on Holcomb Oil and Gas Inc./Key Gas Holding, LLC.  The only active contract we have in place with Holcomb is an Enfolio II Spot and the interest assignment letter sent by Holcomb does not cover an agreement so broad.  I spoke with Susan Herrera at Holcomb [(505) 326-0550] and asked her to send an assignment letter.  She didn't seem to really understand what I needed to I also gave her Gerald's number in Legal.

Once we receive a good assignment, I will request that the Global Counterparty group set up the CP.  Sharon will process the assignment at that point.  Depending on whether we want to split deal 901255 or repath will depend on how long this process takes.  I will keep everyone informed in the meantime.

   $129
      rate.
           Below
           you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
      matters
           which
           one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
      They're both
           on
           my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

           I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
   from
      SA.  I
           estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
      right?)
           We'll
           actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
   family
      from the
           Valley will be there as well.

           If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
   at
      the
           hotel
           sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
   wedding
      together
           from
           there.

           In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
   got
      him a
           gift
           yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

"RE: Still here and still ready...","Ernie,  I think that's right.  It makes sense since he is Chief Weapons Officer.  Bieraugel is one smart dude.  He helped me through many an engineering class.  Wouldn't be surprised to see Admiral Bieraugel one day.  

Did you see on CNN how the Navy guys are writing ""For NYPD"" and ""FDNY"" on the bombs being dropped in Afghan!  Eat that!!

Yep, Saturday was pretty depressing.  I have to hand it to OU.  Stoops is an outstanding coach.  I will still go to the games, though some of the luster is lost. How is the family doing?  My little sister Sharon had a little boy yesterday.  William Boone.  Pretty weird when your little sister starts having babies.  We still need to get together when we get a chance.  Let me know when you get some time.

Gerald,

Does LCDR mean Lieutenant Commander?  On my last email his title was LT, just
lieutenant.  I guess that means our boy has been promoted......

The Horns weren't too impressive on Sat.............I was going to go to the
Colorado game, but I think I might skip now, seems like the whole season is
shot.........

Amigos, I can't say anything about what we are doing out here.  I will tell

I appreciate the kind thoughts and words.  We're keeping the faith out here.
Take care.  Paul.

Hi Gerald,

I hope that things have gone well with your first set
of law clerks.  I was writing to confirm that I will
be starting work for you next Monday, July 2.  I have
been trying to contact the HR representative that I
spoke with initially, but she hasn't returned my
calls.  I just wanted to make sure that everything was
set for me to begin working.

I also wanted to let you know that I heard from the
HBA about the photograph you recommended me for.  I
wanted to thank you for remembering me.  I think that
will be a great opportunity for me.

If you need to contact me, my phone number is

or my mobile is 281-814-9934.

Sincerely,

Adjusted purchase price s/b $209,159,347.
Build up of this number is
$204,000,000 purchase
+$4,000,705 estimated true-up
+$1,158,642 Friday final settlement

Number does not include the estimated 109K due from Westport.

The Payment schedule goes like this

NBP owes $1,158,642 through the true-up
ENA owes $1,937,200 throught the exec contract

These amounts will be netted with ENA left paying a total of $778,558.
On Oct. 1 ENA will pay $669,600.  (this is the normal wire payment for executory contract ---  $21,600 per day for 31 days)
On Nov. 1 ENA will pay 108,958 which is the balance.

These payment due not include any dollars owed due to the outstanding June and July Westport revenue payment estimated at $109,000.  Its just a coincident.    

Also, we would like to add a short statement which indicates ENA continued agreement in providing backup documentation on some the expenditures NBP has agreed to pay.

"RE: Enfolio agreement","Max,  The agreement calls for them to provide to ENA certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ENA under this agreement.  A letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient.  To the extent they don't provide this, an Early Termination event occurs.  We can still call for collateral in accordance with Section 4.5 if they don't meet the thresholds.  The item added in your Sentence #1 below does concern me.  This seems to be a floated revenue system and I am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there.  I need to review these additions with Colorado Springs, because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements.  We probably need to get on a conference call with them.
 
I am probably OK with the arbitration provision, depending on how the other items turn out.
 
Tyrell,  do you want to set something up a call with Marcus and his attorney to discuss these issues?

A couple of thoughts regarding the redline:
 
1) Scope of Agreement: ..""judgement resulting from this Agreement shall be made only from the revenues received from Customer's natural gas system operations..""  I need to re-review the financials to determine how much the gas system operations is worth.  Because of this clause, $15mm in credit may be too much.  Once I can get on the net, I'll review.
 
2) Scope of Agreement:  ""Furthermore, in accordance with the Colorado Springs City Charter, performance of Customer's obligations.....expressly subject to appropriation of funds for such purpose by the City Council.""  In case we are in a position to call for margin, what is the process of getting it?  Do they have to get permission / authorization from the city, etc..? Tyrell had asked me the process how we call and what we accept for margin, but I'd like to understand the ease and/or difficulty of receiving margin from them.  We may never hit the threshold, but if we do and we can't get margin, we may have a big problem.  
 
3) Gerald, I assume you're ok with the arbitration clauses?  
 
Give me a call if anyone wants to discuss further.

Subject:	RE: Dudes...

Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, ""Where is this relationship headed?""  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.

You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35"" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20"" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out

Attached is the structure with my comments.  Concerning the earlier question.  It is not clear under Texas law whether the surface rights by themselves are sufficient to convery the right to use property for gas storage.  Thus the rights should be leased from both the surface owner and the mineral owner to be sure.  I revised the transaction sheet to reflect this.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Everything looks fine from Credit's standpoint, but I forgot to mention one Enron Entity. Please add ENA Upstream Company, LLC to the list of companies covered. This entity will transact Physical Natural Gas, possibly with all 3 Duke Entities. Sorry about any confusion that this might cause.

At your request I have attempted to put together a format for the Enron Corp. Guaranty covering multiple Enron Entities and three Duke entities for financial gas, physical gas and other products to be defined.  When we have finalized what we want this form to look like I will create the corresponding Duke Guaranty.  

Darren, do we have any outstanding Enron Corp. Guaranties that this guaranty will supercede?

John and Jeff, can you fill in the descriptive ""Whereas"" clauses relating to the Enron entities and products that you handle?  Please call me if you have any questions on what we are trying to do with this document.

I spoke with Lisa Herman late Thursday and proposed the multi-product/mulit-affiliate grty. She seemed excited and ""encouraged,"" but wanted an additional entity added, Duke Energy Field Services, LP.  This entity will only comduct PHYSICAL business. Let mw know what I can do to help speed along the process.

Gerald,

There were two changes to be made to the legal description of the property contained on the first page of the agreement as well as in Exhibit B:

1) In the third line, it should read a distance of 49.28' not 49.26'.

2) In the fourth line, the degree symbol is left off the N 51?.  

I will send you through interoffice mail a copy of the survey plat for the land.  Will you or Keith take care of forwarding a copy of the agreement to the police jury for review?

I am attaching the following documents for your review:

1).  Purchase and  Sale Agreement,

2)  Draft of the body of a letter from LRCI to the Police Jury

I have revised the Purchase and Sale Agreement to add the language to
the suggested by Kim Torres (in ? 4) and to add Louisiana Resources,
Inc. and Louisiana Resources, L.P. as intervenors in the Cash Sale to
quitclaim the property to the Police Jury to solve the title problem.

Please contact me upon receipt to discuss and to fill in the blanks.

The improvements located on the Subject Property bear Municipal Address 119 Robin Street, Napoleonville, Louisiana, 70390.

Whereas, Seller is desirous of selling, and Buyer is desirous of purchasing, one hundred percent of Seller's interest in the Subject Property.

	Now Therefore, in consideration of the purchase price to be paid by Buyer to Seller and the mutual agreements contained herein, the Parties hereto acknowledge and agree as follows:

	1.	Description of Property.  Seller agrees to sell and Buyer agrees to purchase all of Seller's right, title and interest in the Subject Property. The actual sale of the Subject Property shall be by Cash Sale, containing special warranties, substantially in the form of Exhibit ""B"", attached hereto and incorporated herein for all purposes.

	2.	Purchase Price.  The purchase price for the Subject Property to be paid by Buyer to Seller for the Subject Property shall be One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) in cash due and payable by cashier's check made payable to Seller and delivered to Seller contemporaneously with the receipt by Buyer of the Cash Sale executed by Seller and vesting all of Seller's ownership interest in and to the Subject Property in Buyer.

	3.	Not an Option.  This is not an option, but it is an executory contract to buy and sell and it shall be so construed in all respects.  No Party may withdraw from this Agreement all Parties grant unto each other and reserve unto themselves the absolute right to demand specific performance of this Agreement.

	4.	Warranties by Seller.  Seller's interest in and to the Subject Property is and will be transferred to and accepted by Buyer ""AS IS, WHERE IS"" AND IN ITS PRESENT CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR.  BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SELLER HAS NOT MADE, AND SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE CONDITION OR QUALITY OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW NOW OR HEREAFTER IN EFFECT, AND ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. BUYER HAS INSPECTED THE SUBJECT PROPERTY AND HAS SATISFIED ITSELF AS TO THE PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION, BOTH SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE PRESENCE, RELEASE OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES.  BUYER EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL CLAIMS TO ANY AND ALL REDHIBITORY DEFECTS AND/OR VICES AND ALL CLAIMS BASED ON THE FITNESS OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FOR ANY INTENDED PURPOSE.   BUYER IS RELYING SOLELY UPON ITS OWN INSPECTION OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY AND BUYER SHALL ACCEPT ALL OF THE SAME IN AN ""AS IS, WHERE IS"" CONDITION.  THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE FACE OF THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AS TO THE SUBJECT PROPERTY.

	Seller warrants that it is the record title owner of the Subject Property, and warrants that it has good and merchantable title, free and clear of any and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against all claims asserted by parties asserting adverse title, liens or encumbrances.

	Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of ______________ and that the person executing this Agreement and the Act of Cash Sale pursuant hereto on behalf of the Seller has valid and binding authority to do so.

	5.		INDEMNITIES.   BUYER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, REIMBURSE AND HOLD SELLER, ITS PARENT AND AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE ""SELLER GROUP"") FREE AND HARMLESS FROM ANY COSTS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES (WHETHER ON ACCOUNT OF PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH OR ON ACCOUNT OR PROPERTY DAMAGE) OR CAUSES OF ACTION AND LOSSES OF WHATSOEVER NATURE (INCLUDING ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COURT COSTS) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR IN ANY WAY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY, ON OR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH COSTS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, CAUSES OF ACTION OR LOSSES ARE DUE TO SELLER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

	6.		Proration of Taxes.    All property, ad valorem and similar taxes applicable to the Subject Property shall be prorated as of the Effective Date between Seller and Buyer. Such proration shall be final and shall not be the subject of adjustment after the final bills are rendered.

If, for the current ad valorem tax year, the taxable value of the Subject Property that is the subject of this Agreement is determined by a special appraisal method that allows for appraisal of the property at less than market value, the person to whom the property is transferred may not be allowed to qualify the Subject Property for that special appraisal in a subsequent tax year and the Subject Property may then be appraised at its full market value.  In addition, the transfer of the Subject Property or a subsequent change in the use of the property may result in the imposition of an additional tax plus interest as a penalty for the transfer of the change in the use of the land. Buyer acknowledges that there shall be no proration for, and Buyer shall be responsible for, payment of any ""roll back"" taxes or any other redetermination of property taxes assessed or relating to the year of the closing and years preceding the year of closing due or based upon any change in the use of the Subject Property at and after the closing hereunder.

7.		Disputes.   Any dispute relating to this Agreement shall be resolved by binding, self-administered arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (""AAA"") and all such proceedings shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.  A single arbitrator shall be selected under the expedited rules of the AAA.  Only damages allowed pursuant to this Agreement may be awarded and the arbitrator shall have no authority to award consequential, treble, exemplary or punitive damages of any type under any circumstances regardless of whether such damages may be available under Louisiana law. The arbitrator shall have the power to award the remedy of specific performance. The results of such arbitration shall be conclusive and binding, provided, however, that both Parties shall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such equitable relief as is necessary to preserve and enforce their rights under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, either Party may join the other Party to any action, suit or proceeding with respect to which the Party seeking such joinder is a defendant, if the other Party is required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless such defendant in accordance with the terms of the provisions hereof.   Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having a jurisdiction hereof.

8.		Entirety and Severability.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties related to the purchase and sale of the Subject Property.  There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations (whether oral or written) affecting the Subject Property other than those herein expressed.  In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been herein contained.

9.		Governing Law.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED UNDER AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA AND FEDERAL LAW AS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 7 ABOVE.

10.		Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement, and all of the terms and provisions hereof, shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto, and their respective successors and assigns.

11.	Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and need not be signed by more than one of the Parties and all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

	12.	Further Assurances.  Each Party agrees that it will promptly perform all other acts and execute and deliver all other documents as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

	13.	Attorney's Fees.  In the event of the commencement of an arbitration proceeding or a breach of any of the provisions contained herein by either Party, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to collect from the other Party, as part of its damages for said breach, reasonable attorneys' fees associated with enforcing or defending any provision hereof.

	14.	Amendments. This Agreement may be modified or amended only in writing signed by both Parties which expressly refers to this Agreement and states an intention to modify or amend it.  No such amendment or modification shall be effected by use of any purchase order, acknowledgment, invoice or other form of either Party and in the event of conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any such form, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

	15.	Waiver.  A waiver by either Party of a breach of any of the terms of this Agreement by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of the terms of this Agreement.  The failure of any Party to insist upon strict performance of any provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right under it shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.

	16.	Termination.  This Agreement shall expire and shall be of no further force or effect Ninety (90) days from the Effective Date unless prior to such time the Parties have entered into an act of Cash Sale transferring the Subject Property from the Seller to the Buyer.

Gerald:

    I have been contacted by Kim Torres of the Assumption Parish Police
Jury.  She has some questions and concerns about the Purchase & Sale
Agreement, to wit:

1).  They want to add warranty language to ? 4 as follows:

    Seller warrants that it is the record title owner to the property
being sold, and warrants it has good and merchantable title, free of any
and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
buyer for the same.

    Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that
persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding
authority to do so.

I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor
revisions which I will do.

2).  They are concerned about the warranty language which covers
hazardous wastes in ? 4.  They tell me that they have not done an
environmental inspection of the property.  They want to know if there
have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on
the property.  They are looking for something in writing that no such
sources existed.

3).  Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31,
1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to
Louisiana Resources Co., Inc.  Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc.  I
have not done a title exam so I cannot explain this discrepancy.

4).  She gave me the physical address of the property and the name of
the Police Jury President which I will insert in the documents.

Please contact me to discuss our response to these concerns.

Keith

Lisa,

This is the matrix I got from Judy Thorne on which GTCs to use.  Can you please double-check it and see if anything has changed?

Based on this, one-day deals will fall under a GTC Spot if we don't have a GISB in place with the producer.  In that instance, we don't need special handling in Sitara.

Hope this helps.  Please let me know what you find out from Gerald.

Anyway, Cristi sent us some pictures from the  twins' birthday party. We knew you would enjoy this one of J.J.
 
I am also sending you a picture of Madeline and  Frank...there is a big difference between little girls and little girls as is  evident in their smiles.  Ha!

The By-Laws are the ones we sent by fax to Barry L. ?   And yes, these are the latest that the company has.  The other question  that you have about having 2 people executing the agreements.  Yes it is  necessary that 2 of those will need to sign.  One of them will be Genaro  Larrea Mota Velazco and I believe that the other one will be Daniel Tellechea  Salido (this I will have to confirm)

Exhibit B to the Agency and Management Services  Agreement.  This agency
agreement is El Paso's form and must be  executed by ENA, Mexicana, and El

Please review.

(See attached  file: Agency & Management Agreement2.doc)(See attached file:

We are working on the gas purchase agreement and should  forward shortly.

We received the power of attorney and bylaws you  emailed.  I had a Spanish
speaking attorney in our office assist me  with their review.  The bylaws
look fine. We would like you to follow  up with a certified copy in the
mail.   For now can you confirm  via a response to this email, that these
are the latest bylaws on  file?

 He noted that under the Power of Attorney, it would be  required that two
of the gentlemen listed on page 2 of the power of  attorney documentation,
execute our agreements.  Can you  confirm?  Would be happy to discuss this
with you.

Thank you  for your cooperation.

Okay, all.  I am sure there is a very good deal behind this, but do any of you know where the recently received, state of West Virginia title to a used trailer belongs?  The year of the trailer is 1995, the make of the trailer is ""NORS"", and the serial number is N01020318TN.  The title was issued by WV on 09/26/01 to Enron North America Corp., no lienholder (well, that's a good fact!).

Please ask around your groups regarding who is interested in holding on to this title.  Unless otherwise notified, I am going to have it sent to the vault.  Please call me if you know to whom it should be directed.

"RE: Product Description","The product description was to be used for various pipelines (e.g. NGPL, Transco, etc.). Yes, in this product ENA would always be the seller or the buyer of the capacity to be released.  I visited with Steve earlier, and the concept that Julie Gomez had discussed earlier was allowing third party pipelines or third parties to use EOL to buy and sell capacity from or to other third parties.  As far as I know, these were just discussions and the only EOL product implemented was the one I forwarded to you.

I agree with Chip but question which would be faster.  I think both routes are identical in terms of result but may differ in the amount of time needed to accomplish them.  I believe that we are allowed to enter into new agreements, without court approval, provided that they are in the ordinary course.  My understanding of the process for assuming an existing contract is that it typically requires some oversight/approval by the bankruptcy court/creditors committee and further it may require the debtor to rectify any prior defaults (I am less sure of this one).  Obviously, a bankruptcy lawyer should be consulted.  By carbon copy of this email, I am asking Gerald Nemec to run this to ground with one of the A&K or Weil lawyers.

I spoke with Duane Harris from PB-KBB (Tommy Smith's boss) regarding the Napoleanville work.  I briefed him on how the pre and post bankruptcy invoices will be treated.  They are willing to keep working provided we do the following:

1.	Provide an accounting of what invoices are pre and what invoices are post bankruptcy - so we can get on the same page with them regarding the numbers.

2.	Put in place a new contract between PB-KBB and the Estate to cover post bankruptcy work.  Please work with G. Nemec to develop the form of the contract that we want to propose to the cash committee.

3.	He also wants to have a discussion with regard to the pre-bankruptcy invoices, but he realizes he is an unsecrued creditor with respect to this work.

Lets you, Stuart and I chat by the end of the day to see where you are on this.

Subject:	Re: FW: Bridgeline-Crawfish ROW agreement  My file ENR-091-1005

Gerald:

    I reviewed the enclosed agreement and made several revisions.  I am
enclosing a redlined version showing my revisions for your convenience.
 My major revisions are summarized as follows:

    1.  I changed all references to ""rights of way"" or ""easement"", to
""servitude"" or ""sevitude of right of use"".  Louisiana law does not use
the terms ""easement"" or ""right of way"".

    2.  I rearranged the last three clauses in the 1st paragraph for
clarity.

    3.  I combined the content of the 5th paragraph into the 3d paragraph.

    4.  I change the 6th paragraph slightly to strengthen the rights
retained by Grantor.

    5.  I added language to paragraph 7 to give more detail to the
process of abandonment and to strengthen the rights of the Grantor upon
abandonment.

 Please call with any questions or if you need further help with this.
 Thank you for allowing me to provide professional advice on this matter.

I am a member of the  Houston Bar Association -- Minority Opportunities in the Legal Profession  Committee.  One of the programs we sponsor is a first-year law student  internship program.   This committee meets with the students at all of  the law schools in Houston and asks them to submit their resumes.  We then  provide copies of the resumes to prospective employers for review.  The  employer then selects the students they would like to interview.   
 
Some employers have  the students participate in their permanent hiring programs.  Others  provide this simply as a learning experience for the students.  The  employer determines the length of the internship and the compensation.  Six  weeks is a common period.  This is a great program which has provided  valuable experience to a large number of students for many years.  If your  organization would be interested in participating in this program, or if you  would like more information, please e-mail me or call me.  I appreciate  your consideration of this matter.   (Please feel free to forward this  e-mail to the appropriate person(s) in your organization.)

other hazardous waste sources on it.  I believe a letter from LRCI
stating that to its knowledge there have been no such sources on or

Are you retarded?  I went and prcied those trash cans yesterday and they are
$100.  Why would anyone need a $100 trash can?  Just kidding.

I am so very excited.  I bought a couch and a oversized chair with ottoman.
How exciting is that?

Needless to say, i did not buy your chrome trash can!

 Dear Debra and Gerald,

Lunch at 12:00 on Friday would be great. I was thinking that I could pick
you guys up in front of Enron and then we could go to Irmas in downtown(they
have valet parking). It may take a little over an hour to have lunch, so if
your schedules for Friday are too busy, then we can go to Ninfa's or
Treebairds. Looking forward to having lunch.

Best Regards,

Subject:	RE: Dudes...

Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, ""Where is this relationship headed?""  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  

Gerald

You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35"" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20"" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out

Gerald:

Attached is my draft ""Purchase and Sale Agreement"" based on the form
used in Texas.  The following are the major revisions which I made:

1.  I put the property description in the body of the agreement.  It is
short enough and I find this prevents problems which occasionally come
up when using Exhibits.  I also added a blank for the municipal address
of the improvements.  This is required by Louisiana law, IF the property
has an address.

2.  In paragraph ""1""  and in the Act of Cash Sale, I added a reservation
of mineral rights.  If you are not concerned about this it can be taken
out.

3.  In paragraph ""3""  I added language specifically waiving buyer's
claims under the Louisiana laws of Redibition  which are specific legal
warranties.

4.  I changed paragraph ""5"" to limit buyer's indemnity to matters
arising after the closing date.

5.  In paragraph ""7""  I added a provision to allow the arbitrator to
order specific performance.  I also added provisions allowing the
parties to enforce the arbitrator's orders in court, and allowing the
parties resort to the courts for injunctive relief, if necessary.

6.  I added a provision for awarding attorney's fees in paragraph ""13"".

7.  I added paragraphs ""12"", ""14"", & ""15"" which are helpful boilerplate.

8.  I added Paragraph ""16"" to provide a drop dead date.  The length of
time is purely arbitrary.

Please call or e-mail me with any questions.

Would you like me to handle the closing also?

Subject:	Dow Invoice

I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following

1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000
    3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.

Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.

2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40
     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)

Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.

3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500

I find no basis for this in the contract.


Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	RE: Huber Docs

We expect a ruling in the 336 docket to allocate receipt point capacity on El Paso, and that could be done before the end of the year.  BUT, we expect that will be subject of rehearing applications and possibly even court appeal.  And that allocation is likely to be revised if and when the full requirements/capacity problems get addressed in the other dockets in which they are pending.  So, the possibility of revisions to receipt point allocations exist even after an order is issued, and is final and non-appealable in 336.  The language in the draft agreement states that Huber acknowledges that EP's capacity allocation procedures are under review by FERC and that the capacity under contract will be bound by any modifications resulting from any FERC proceeding related to such capacity allocation procedures.  I think this is broad enough to cover all potential FERC actions, as it says ""any"" FERC proceeding.  Since we want to keep it open for future revisions, I would not advise inserting the usual  ""final, non-appealable order"" since you want to be able to track any changes that come along, however they may be themselves changed by a later order.

Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.

Gerald, sorry I haven't replied back. It's my busy season at work. You know
she came last Saturday. She did an awesome job!!! Thank you so much for the
info. I was doing a volunteer home repair project, so I didn't get to meet
her. But, I'm sure next Saturday I will impress her with my expertise of
the Spanish language (like I impressed the citizens of  Spain, or at least
the people at Joy Enslava!)

How's work? I hope things start working out. Between you, my dad and many
others, a lot of money is being lost. Dad has to exercise 2,000 shares by
end of the year and another 3,000 in January. He's lost over a million
dollars! Hopefully, we can all get together this weekend and drink our
sorrows away!!! After all this time, I'm still waiting to get an offer from
the other side of the company. I think it's around the corner though. Talk
to you soon.

Her name is Lucinda.  Can't remember her husbands name, but I call him
Lucinda's husband.  The number is 713-697-1626.  In case that doesn't work,
her husband's work number is 281-970-2020.  I pay her $50 every time she
comes, which is every two weeks.  She does it all.  Mops, vacuums, dusts,
washes dishes, cleans bathrooms and kitchen, she also washes my clothes,
bed sheets, and towels.   They do speak very little English.  Her husband
speaks better, but they may have you speak with their son, unless you want
to use your Spanish and pretend you are back in Madrid.  Use my name.  If
she has availability, her and her husband will come out to the house and
take a look.  You can go over with her what you want done and then agree on
the price.  I give her a key to my house and she comes when I am not there.
A lot of people I know use her and she is trustworthy.  Feel free to ask if
you have questions.

Brucie,  You weren't supposed to tell anybody about that!!  Maureen,  I am planning on setting up a rental car for Janel and myself and we can cut you in on that action.  Our flight leaves Myrtle Beach at 11:40 on Sunday so if you are leaving out of Myrtle Beach that might work for you also.

Maureen,

I think that Janel Guerrero and Gerald Nemec might be getting into Myrtle Beach,SC around that time.  I have cc'd them on this email so you guys can start a dialogue about getting to Ocean Isle, NC in one car.

Good Morning Brucie! I have a quick question, do you know if anyone is arriving in Myrtle Beach on Friday around 4:30? If anyone arrives around that time, maybe we can share a ride somehow. Vicki and Dennis are flying into Charleston the night before and offered to pick me up on the way but I don't want to incovienice them if I don't have to. Have a good day, Maureen

Subject:	Summary of discussion with Gerald 



Scott,

I talked to Gerald after our telecon as you requested ----- here's the summary:

I repeated to Gerald my reply when you asked my opinion regarding the best way to approach Clark.  To reiterate for clarity, I suggest that Scott tell Clark we are not satisfied with BCCK's management of activities related to field construction and construction management activities.  If you (Scott) feel it is appropriate or necessary to offer details, the general reasons are: (1) Poor communication leading to schedule delays and/or cost increases; (2)  A very casual (and consequently unacceptable) approach to improving the overall project schedule as necessary to achieve a 15 December 2001 in-service date; and, (3) Unilateral decision-making by BCCK without the consent of all Crescendo partners having the same effect as (1) above.  As a result, Scott and Ken mutually agree and have directed Dave to take a lead role in completing all construction, testing, commissioning, start-up and related activities.  It is important to stress to Clark, that, while Dave and his delegates have primary authority and responsibility for completing these activities, it will not be done at the exclusion of BCCK.  To the contrary, Crescendo requests and expects BCCK's full and open participation.  

Though the contract does not explicitly address this action, Gerald agreed that since Enron wears the vast majority of all types of risk in this project, it is reasonable for us (Enron) to take action in order to protect our interests.  In addition, Ken Krisa agrees with the need and reasons for making this move, establishing strong support (though not, perhaps, unanimous) at the Crescendo LLC level.  Because the contract does not provide specifically for this action, our options -- in increasing order of severity with regard to impact upon BCCK and the potential for unpleasant reactions by same -- are:

Most Productive, Least Destructive to Project and Relationships:

1.  Take the direct approach to Clark as I described above.

Plan B:

2.  Submit a change order under the appropriate section of the Contract changing BCCK's scope of work and informing them of the change in management philosophy and leadership.

Desperation Tactic:

3.  Declare the agreement in default due to non-performance and take over all activities contemplated by the agreement.

(Gerald --- How did I do???)

Dave

Gerald,

The Upstream group is doing a considerable amount of repeat business with several customers. There is an increasing need to execute Master agreements with these customers. 

We would like to begin the development of a Master Wellhead contract that includes the same type of provisions that our Upstream GTC contracts include such as tolerances, keep whole, nomination deadlines, etc. Can you please let me know if you see any issues with changing the Master Firm contract to accomodate the Upstream business or if there is anything else that you may need from us to begin creating this Upstream Master?

Thanks,

            home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends house.
   He
         plays
            the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session
   (or
      at
            least
            we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday I
      went

         of
            sick

               Hi Jennifer,  How was your weekend?  Did you do anything
      exciting?
         I
               was
               invited to go with some friends to the GK on Friday night,
   but
      I
            thought
               that two Fridays in a row would be pushing my luck, so I
   begged
         off.

"RE: ENA - NNG Hubbard Transaction   - Past Due Amounts payable to Midland Power Cooperative (""Midland"")","At this point, I don't think any assignment to ECS solve any of these issues.  We still have to get approval for any cash outlaws from ECS since it is 100% owned by ENA.  Also assignment from a debtor entity to a non-debtor entity might require certain approvals from the Bankruptcy Ct. and the DIP financing.  I can look into it if it necessary, but does it really help the cash situation?

Gerald,
Since the agreements with Hubbard were executed by ENA (and not ECS)
is there some assignment from ENA to ECS that we should or need to look
at for post-petition business?  
 
Sounds like they are planning to not pay the delinquent bills but to make 
assurances for the billing going forward.  This is a BIG deal to these small
Cooperatives that we typically work with.  Our load generally represents a 
very large percentage of their total business and they have wholesale providers
that they have to pay.  A couple of our monthly bills could put these guys
into financial distress themselves.  
 
I need to find and read throught the contract with Midland Power before this
gets too far down the road.  I'm out today (Monday) and tomorrow dealing
with some personal stuff with my mom.  Call me tomorrow morning (9 - 10) or we can visit on Wednesday when I'm in the office.

Stuart, 

Ultimately we may have to decide if it is more advantageous to pay the pre-petition amounts due or put up whatever deposits/prepayments that may be required to give the utility ""additional assurance"" of payment of post-petition amounts.  Remember, however, that pre-petition payments will need to be considered in light of the relatively tight baskets imposed by the bankruptcy court and the DIP lenders.

Regards, 

Dave

Chip/Dave, 

If you will recall, you had me check into whether Midland was a utility under the Bankruptcy Code.  Your thought was that past due amounts to ""utilities"" had special treatment under the law of bankruptcy.  Gerald and I communicated with David Zdunkewicz of Andrews & Kurth and concluded that Midland is likely a ""utility"" and that as such, would not be able to stop service for failure to pay pre-petition obligations.  Utilities, such as Midland, are however entitled to request additional assurance of payment.  Our first day bankruptcy order provides such additional assurance by definition, unless a utility counterparty objects in a writing sent to Steve Woods within 30 days of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy (December 2nd).

By carbon copy of this email, I am asking Steve whether he has received any such objection from Midland and, if none has been received to date, to notify myself and Gerald Nemec upon receiving any such objection. 

David Z. suggested that we wait until the expiration of the 30 day period (roughly January 2, 2002) and if nothing is received by that time, just pay invoices which relate to post-petition periods.  We must, however, pay all post petition invoices in a timely manner and it probably makes sense to pre-approve these.

Thanks 

Stuart

I doubt you are able to receive email at this time, but just in case you
are...............wanted to let you know that you are making the news!  Just
read an article in the USA Today online that lists your ship as one in the
Arabian Sea that has launched Tomahawks.  So I'm bragging about you to everyone

the Taliban, he's pushing the button himself!""  I know you guys are well-trained

entire country is behind you (90% approve the actions in a poll!).

So God bless and Godspeed, you get back safely to those four kids of yours!

Take care bud,

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.
