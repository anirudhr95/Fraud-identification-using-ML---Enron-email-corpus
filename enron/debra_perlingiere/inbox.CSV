"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

"WENH January Meeting...","MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT:

ANNUAL MEETING AND ELECTION OF 2002 WENH BOARD

Dear Members:

The  annual meeting of the Women's Energy Network of Houston is normally
held at the November or December luncheon meeting.  This year, however, WENH 
held two out-of-the-ordinary events in November and December that precluded
the annual meeting from being held in those months.  WENH's bylaws provide
that ""if the December meeting is not held, the annual meeting shall be held
at the next WENH meeting.""  Accordingly, the WENH Board of Directors has
scheduled the annual meeting to be held at our January luncheon meeting at
Brennan's Restaurant, 3300 Smith St., on January 9, 2002, at 12:00 p.m.

At the annual meeting, the WENH membership in attendance will elect the
Officers and Directors of the WENH Board of Directors for 2002.  No WENH
member may vote by proxy.  Following careful deliberation of all nominated
candidates, the Nominating Committee, composed of Leesa Foster, President;
Robin Dyer, Immediate Past President; Lisa Craig, Vice President and
retiring Board member; Meg Healy, WENH member; and Karyl Lawson, WEHN member
(with Denise Cassata, WENH member, as a substitute at the Nominating
Committee's final meeting) hereby announces its recommended slate for the
upcoming elections at the annual meeting, as follows:

2002 WENH Board Nominations


POSITION			NOMINATION

President 			Tammy Naron				

Vice President			Tammy Dowe

Secretary	  		Mary Wilson

Treasurer			Tammy Norman  

Assistant Treasurer		Suzy Romoser

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

I do not see a problem assigining the ENA deals to ECC as they are current month deals that will allow netting of the purchases and sales.  Should not affect the PMTM which has a threshold in the contract.  Would like to try to finish up quickly. Please advise if anything CRM can do to help.

States Power Company


Patrick:

At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company
such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referenced
Agreement for Northern States Power Company (""NSP"").  I apologize for the
delay.  Our comments are as follows:

Northern States Power Company Agreement

Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues.  We request in Section
4.1 that the $50,000,000 dollar level be applicable to each of our
companies.  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section
4.7 be increased to $25,000,000 as to each of our companies. 
   
2.4 Confirmations.  In the second line, please change ""may"" to ""shall"".  We
need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for
regulatory purposes.  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that
the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed
and returned, in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 2.21
Transactions.    

3.5 Netting and 4.4. Offset.  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in
the normal course of business under these contracts.  Amounts due to and
from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes,
especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize when NSP
acts as the Seller to Enron in a Transaction.  Accordingly, we propose that
the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be
deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be
applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and
the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement.    

4.1 Early Termination.  I am concerned that the date to be established for
termination of Transactions is without definition.  I would prefer to see
the language in subpart (i) modified to state that the Notifying Party may
""establish a date, which shall be not less than two (2) nor more than ten
(10) Business Days following the date of such notice.""

4.2 Triggering Event.  In the 8th line down, I don't understand the
inclusion of the phrase ""or deemed to be repeated"".  Unless I am missing
something, it doesn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.  Please
delete this phrase in the Agreement.     

4.1 and 4.5 References to Affiliates.  In numerous places throughout the
Agreements and, in particular, in Sections 4.1 and 4.5, reference is made to
Affiliates.  For regulatory reasons, we cannot intermingle the account
status of our affiliated companies.  Moreover, NSP is not authorized to
contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated.  Please delete
all references to Affiliates of NSP in the respective Agreement.  

Article 5. Force Majeure.  The language in this Article is not typical of
most Force Majeure provisions, which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure
for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the
ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period.  The language in
your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time
only, for a duration of up to 60 Days, after which time Force Majeure no
longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement.  In other
words, Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence
involving a separate and independent Transaction.  This is not acceptable.
We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard
Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments.

Section 8.1. Notices.  Prior to the language in the parenthetical, please
insert ""provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically"".

Section 8.2.  Transfer.  We would prefer that this language be revised to
the more traditional language requiring the consent (rather than approval)
of the other Party, ""which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld"".
Please modify this provision accordingly.  

Section 8.3.  Limitation of Remedies.  We are in general agreement with this
provision, however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of
merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use.  The gas sold and purchased
under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the
ordinary use to which it is intended.  Please modify this Section
accordingly.  

Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions.  The GISB
Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day
confirm deadline, rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition.  We
request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry
standard. 

Definition of Material Adverse Change.  This definition needs to be expanded
beyond a review of the level of each company's credit rating.  Please
replace your definition with the following:  

	""Material Adverse Change"" with respect to a Party means (i) any
downgrading of any unsecured, long-term senior debt of such Party 	or
any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit
support for the obligations of such Party (each such entity being a
""Credit Support Provider"" for such Party) such that such debt is
rated below ""BBB-"" or its equivalent by Standard & Poors or below
""Baa3"", or its equivalent, by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.; 	provided,
that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	any
unsecured, long-term, senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard &
Poors or Moody's Investor Services, Inc., then a 	Material Adverse
Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which, in the
reasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a material
adverse effect on the creditworthiness, 	financial responsibility, or
ability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider, as applicable, to
perform its obligations in connection 	herewith.   

Definition of Replacement Price Differential.  Although we are in general
agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential, it seems
preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable, cost of
cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day
average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred.
Please modify your definition accordingly.  

Please make changes to the Northern States Power Company Agreement
consistent with our comments as set forth above.  Should you have questions
or wish to discuss any of our requested changes, you may contact me via
return e-mail or at the phone number listed below.     

Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to working with you to
finalize this Agreement.

Debra,

All of the thresholds and Mac's on the contract look good.  However, please confirm in which name the contract will be executed as, please.  I think that the contract should be executed with Atmos Energy Corporation.  In which case all of the references to Customer in the contract will have to be changed (as they all currently refer to Greeley Gas Company, a div....).  The problem is that we do term deals with Atmos as well (most of them) and if it is a division of the contract should be with Atmos and not Greeley Gas, a div.

Thanks and sorry about the delay,

Veronica

 Please look at the attached redline from Greeley regarding the credit sections.  As you may recall a previous discussion regarding the exact name for the contract, the contract will be in the name of Atoms Energy Corp.  Please let me know asap.  Thanks

   November 1, 2001

   Dear WENH Members:

   Elections for the new Board of Directors for 2002 are coming up. This is
   a
   reminder of what was announced to the membership at our luncheon on
   October
   10th:

   Please remember to e-mail Leesa Foster, President of WENH,  at
   lfoster@kmg.com by November 6, 2001

   information
   for both, including available Board positions below:

   2001.  The Nominating
   Committee will consist of the Outgoing President, Immediate Past

   each

"GISB Amendment for AVISTA ENERGY, INC.","
Debra,

I sent a hard copy of the GISB amendment to Kimberly Gentle of the above referenced company.  She said they executed the amendment and sent it overnight to us on 10/17 and it was signed by our mailroom on Oct. 19, 2001.  She called to find out whether we have received it.  I asked her to fax me a copy of the executed GISB but she couldn't find her copy and that's why she wanted to make sure that we received our copy.  Please let me know because I need to get back to her.

Thanks,


Ann

There is a volume discrepancy for deal # 117853/YK6095.1 as reported in Sitara and TAGG.  Please take a look at this deal.  
Also, is anybody working on a special contract for this deal as it is a 2-year deal attached to a GTC.

We need to get together shortly to plan out the  spring youth group activities.  Let's find a date after Thanksgiving to  meet.  My suggestion is on 11/25 but I'm available whenever.  I'll get  a preliminary calendar started and we can add to it.

"W.E. or Mary Brewer Trust","Good morning.  I just returned from a week and a half vacation and wanted to check the status of the request I had left with you on the 17th.  In regards to the sale of one of the Brewer wells, I had faxed you a copy of documentation filed with Enron back in 1997 for you to review and confirm that the documentation was sufficient to make the necessary change from W.E. or Mary Brewer Trust to Brewer Natural Gas LLC.  Mr. Brewer is awaiting notification from me that this issue is either resolved or more documentation is needed.

Please let me know if you have had a chance to look this documentation over or if I need to re-fax the information for your review.

"Master Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.","
Hello Debra:

As you know, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. (""DETM"") and Enron
North America Corp. (""ENA"") are operating under a GISB Base Contract dated
December 1, 2000, which covers all of our companies' spot transactions.
However, we still need a contract to cover our companies' term
transactions.  Accordingly, DETM has reviewed ENA's standard master
agreement and has some proposed revisions to this document; attached is a
redlined agreement which reflects DETM's requested changes.

Please review DETM's changes to ENA's agreement and let me know if they are
acceptable.  We would like to execute this agreement as soon as possible
since we currently do not have an agreement that covers our term
transactions, so your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated.
Thank you for your assistance.

Good Morning,
    Enclosed is a draft of a GISB for Utility Resource Solutions, LP.  They have done some small physical volumes secured by a pre-pay, but are interested in establishing a more developed relationship.  As such, they want to enter into a GISB with Enron.  This is their copy forwarded through Jay Reitmeyer.  Please review and advise what needs to be done, if anything, to get this executed.

 Judy attached is the Aspect Amendment as discussed.   The  first paragraph has been revised to reflect the assignment to ENA.   Article 2. now states term dates.  Concerning Articles 3.1 and 3.3, Gerald would not agree to ""one sentence"". Finally, I  included a provision regarding changes to working interest (see # 9), and incorporated meter number on Schedule I.

"Re: GISB contract with DTE Energy Trading","We already have an Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement in place with ENA, which continues on a month-to-month basis since the original one-year term expired on 11/1/01.  I assume that the Spot agreement would enable us to buy/sell interruptible gas, but it also seems to cover firm purchases.

Would the Spot agreement take the place of the Firm agreement?  If not, would having both agreements in place create any overlaps or conflicts?  How would we know which agreement applied to a particular transaction?  (For example, I don't see a netting provision in the Spot agreement, which is something that we would insist upon.)

Please let me know how the agreements would relate to one another.  In the meantime, I will begin to review the Spot agreement in greater detail.

"Enron's Master Firm Sales Agreement","Debra:

I have briefly discussed some of the issues concerning the changes we feel
are appropriate with your diversity program: Ms. Hunter, Mr. Eakins, Ms.
Medcalf.  They were interested about in my reasoning behind the suggested
changes.  I realize their could or will be different verbiage concerning my
change's; however, the intent is firm because of the standard GISB payment
dates previously agreed upon as well as anticipated payment date for other
Resale Customers.

I am assuming there is little room for negotiation as the agreement format
requirement of the Buyer?

Please advise me of your comments concerning the changes so as we can move
forward. I have been asked to keep the Diversity people informed of my
progress so I am copying Ms. Hunter on this E-Mail.

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

"RE: Greeley Gas Company","Debra,

All of the thresholds and Mac's on the contract look good.  However, please confirm in which name the contract will be executed as, please.  I think that the contract should be executed with Atmos Energy Corporation.  In which case all of the references to Customer in the contract will have to be changed (as they all currently refer to Greeley Gas Company, a div....).  The problem is that we do term deals with Atmos as well (most of them) and if it is a division of the contract should be with Atmos and not Greeley Gas, a div.

Thanks and sorry about the delay,

Veronica

Dear EC Members, Alternates, Contracts Subcommittee Members and EC Meeting
Participants,

We have received several requests to extend the comment period for the
consideration of the base contract due to unexpected work load.  After
speaking to the chair of the Contracts Subcommittee and the officers of the
EC, the comment period is extended to January 15 and while it will be
discussed at the EC meeting in December, it will not be voted on for

Barry,

My name is Alisha Mahabir and I have been working on negotiating the MGI/ENA GISB.  I have been in contact with Lourdes Cervantes at MGI; her phone number is 525-232-5990.  There are still a few issues left to be resolved before we can proceed with the execution of this document.  Per Geral Nemec's request, I will outline these changes as they are addressed in Exhibit B to the GISB that was sent over by Lourdes.

Initially I want to note that some changes must be made to the front page of the GISB.  MGI has previously agreed to allow ENA to be the confirming party under Section 2.5.  Additionally, there have been a few problems with allowing payment to be made on the 30th day of the month.  It appears that MGI has been construing this provision broadly so as to make payment on the 2nd day of March after a short month in February.  Thus, we would like Section 7.2 to read ""30th day or, for the Month of February, on the last day of the Month"".  

As for Exhibit B, the changes are as follows:

#4 The words ""or interruptible"" should be deleted from this provision.  The interruptible language conflicts with the ability to do 30 day firm deals under this contract.

#11 This provision deals with when notices are deemed received.  The provision as written provides that notice by first class mail is deemed received 2 business days after mailing.  MGI would like to change this to allow for receipt to mean actual receipt.  Lourdes told me that she will check to see whether the change can be stricken or at least to extend 2 business days to 3 business days.

#12 (a) MGI has agreed to strike the term ""letter"" from the requirement that the Parent issue a guarantee should doubt arise as to Enron's ability to pay.  
      (b)  Originally the GISB provides that a contract can be terminated without prior notice should certain conditions be met.  MGI wants to change this to require the parties to provide 48 hours notice.  Lourdes told me that she would check to see whether this could be changed to 24 hours prior notice.

#16  The language designating ICC is acceptable, however any redundant language should be stricken.

If this memo is at all unclear, please feel free to call me.  My extension is 52722.

"Counterparties","All,

We are currently working on the data model for the Trading Agreements System and have a question pertaining to internal/external counterparties.  Are all agreements between an internal company(counterparty) and an external company(counterparty)?  I spoke with Meredith Stewart (the data architect for this project) and she found an agreement between 2 internal counterparties, e.g. Enron Louisiana and ECT.

Please let me know ASAP.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

 Judy attached is the Aspect Amendment as discussed.   The  first paragraph has been revised to reflect the assignment to ENA.   Article 2. now states term dates.  Concerning Articles 3.1 and 3.3, Gerald would not agree to ""one sentence"". Finally, I  included a provision regarding changes to working interest (see # 9), and incorporated meter number on Schedule I.  Please let me know if you have any other questions and or changes.

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

"URGENT! URGENT! VIRUS ALERT!","Please be aware that there is an email circulating the Enron messaging environment !!!

The infected email has the following characteristics :
Subject :	Hi
Body :	Hi, I found a cool site! <web link> It's really cool!

An alternative version of the infected email also have an Excel spreadsheet attachment.

If you receive this email, DELETE it immediately. DO NOT CLICK ON THE WEB LINK. DO NOT LAUNCH THE EXCEL ATTACHMENT!

Please note that opening the email automatically via the ""preview pane"" does NOT launch the virus.

The Enron global messaging service has taken the necessary steps to ensure all internet email sent to your Enron internet address is virus free. But there are ways that you can ensure viruses do not make their way into our environment  :

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Detection + Prevention = Protection!

Thank you.
