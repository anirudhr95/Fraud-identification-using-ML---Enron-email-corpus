Subject:	Central Illinois Confirm


 I would like to use the following for the Flexible Pricing.   The last sentence  regarding the keep whole verbiage I think you will want to delete this as it does not allow for Force Majeure.

 FLEXIBLE PRICING: During the Period of Delivery for a Transaction, Customer may request a price other than the original Contract Price, being a Fixed Price or (each below defined) by contacting Company during Pricing Hours requesting any such price for a specified quantity of Gas to be Scheduled during selected Months within the Period of Delivery; provided, such request must be made prior to 12:00 noon C.T. of the last Business Day prior to the last trading Day of the NYMEX Gas futures contract for the selected Month.  A Confirmation may be sent by Company to Customer confirming the Flexible Pricing agreement in accordance with Exhibit ""A"" ""Fixed Price"" means a fixed dollar amount agreed to by the Parties.  The price for all Gas for which a Flexible Price has not been agreed by the Parties shall be the original Contract Price applicable to the Transaction.  ""Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Confirmation or the GTC, upon Customer's acceptance of Fixed Price, Customer shall keep whole and hold Company harmless for all cost and expenses incurred by Company with respect to the quantity of Gas that is converted into a Fixed Price, in the event that such quantity of Gas is not Scheduled by Customer for any reasons, including without limitation events of Force Majeure.

For the Section ""Daily Pricing for Physical for Physical Call Option""  

Daily Pricing means the ""Daily Midpoint"" price set forth in Gas Daily
 Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or successor publication, in the column ""Daily Price Survey"" under the listing applicable to the geographic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the relevant gas day.  If there is no single ""Daily Midpoint"" price published for that particular Gas Day, but there is published a ""Common"" range of prices under the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average of such ""Common"" high and low prices.  In the event that no 'Daily Midpoint"" price or ""Common"" range of prices is published for that particular Gas Day, then the Spot Price shall be the average of the following: the price (determined as stated above) for each of the first Gas Day immediately preceding and following the Gas Day in which the default occurred for which a Spot Price can be determined.

Let  me know what you think.

A.  In Section 1.2 insert ""a recorded"" before the word telephone in the second line.  Insert the word ""recorded"" before the word telephonic on the fifth line.  
 
B. In order to clarify the intentions of both Parties in Section 1.3deleted the third sentence in its entirety and replace it with the following:

I.      Add the following language after the first sentence of Section 6, designated as Buyer Pays At and After Delivery Point:
 
All such Taxes shall be paid by Seller directly to the taxing authority unless Buyer is required by law to collect and remit such Taxes, in which event Buyer shall withhold from payments to Seller an amount required to be collected and remitted by Buyer and then remit such amounts to the taxing authority.
 
J.     Add the following language to the end of Section 6 as a new paragraph:  
 
In the event a  federal energy, BTU, consumption, or use tax shall be imposed, both Buyer and 
Seller shall work to reasonably apportion said Tax, taking into account the ability of either party 
to pass through all or a part of such tax . In the event that the parties are unable to reach an 
agreement with respect to the apportionment of any such Tax and such Tax would have a 
substantial adverse effect on any transaction with a forward delivery of six (6) months or greater 
of the party liable for such Tax (the ""Affected Party"") the Affected Party may declare an early 
termination with respect to any transactions then outstanding between the parties which are 
affected by such Tax (""the Affected Transactions"").  The Affected Party shall provide the other 
party with thirty (30) days prior written notice of its intent to terminate the Affected Transactions.  
Such notification shall be made no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of the Tax.

and the other party shall have a net Loss, the party with the net Gain shall pay to the other party fifty percent (50%) of the sum of the absolute value of the net Gain and the absolute value of the net Loss.  Any such payments pursuant to this provision shall be made in accordance with Article 7.  For purposes of this provision ""Gains"" shall mean, with respect to either party, an amount equal to the present value of the economic benefit to it, if any (exclusive of costs), resulting from the termination of the Affected Transactions, calculated in a commercially reasonable manner and in accordance with GAAP.  ""Losses"" shall mean, with respect to either party, an amount equal to the present value of the economic loss to it, if any (exclusive of costs), resulting from the termination of the Affected Transactions, calculated in a commercially reasonable manner and in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
K.   Add the following to the end of  Section 7:
 
7.5             The parties shall net all same currency amounts due and owing (and/or past due from prior billing 
        periods, provided however, that any such past due amounts that are the subject of a bona fide 
        dispute shall not be subject to this Section 7.5 until such dispute is resolved) arising out of the 
                 transactions under this Contract such that the party owing the greater amount shall make a single 
                 payment of the net amount in accordance with Article 7 of this Contract, provided that, except as 
                         expressly provided in this Contract or any  such credit support agreement (if any), no payment 
                required to be made pursuant to the terms of any credit support agreement shall be subject to 
                netting under this or any other provision of this Contract. In the event that the parties have 
                executed a separate netting agreement, the terms and conditions therein shall prevail with respect 
                to this Section 7.5.
 
7.6            Upon either party's request, Buyer and/or Seller shall provide support documentation including 
but not limited to copies of any and all pertinent portions of transporter statements related to 
                 completed transaction between the parties in order to determine the final settlement amount due 
for each production Month.  Each party shall exercise reasonable efforts to provide support 
documentation that is inclusive of volume and price [by location] data for the applicable 
production Month
 
L.    Add to the end of Section 8.2: 
 
In the event of any claim or litigation, at any time, concerning Seller's title to the leases, wells, 
Gas produced or liquid hydrocarbons recovered from the Gas sold here under or the proceed from 
the sale thereof, Buyer shall, without limiting any other remedies available to it, be entitled to 
suspend only those payments related to the subject of (or any product of the subject of) any 
dispute, claim or controversy to Seller until such claims or litigation of title is resolved to Buyer's 
satisfaction.
 
M.   Add the following language to the end of Section 9.1:  
 
Notices of interruption to Firm obligations may be provided verbally, effective immediately and, then shall be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably possible
 
N.    Delete Section 10 in its entirety and replace with the following:
 
10.1         Events of Default.  In the event (each a ""Default"") either party (the ""Defaulting Party"")
 
(i)enters into Bankruptcy whether voluntary or involuntary; 
 
(ii)has a liquidator, administrator, receiver, trustee, conservator or similar official appointed with respect to it or any substantial portion of its property or assets;
(iii)fails to make, when due, any payment required pursuant to this Contract if such failure is not remedied within three (3) Business Days after written notice of such failure is given to the Defaulting Party by the other party (""Non-Defaulting Party"") and provided the payment is not the subject of a good faith dispute; 
 
(iv)fails to provide adequate assurance of its ability to perform all of its outstanding material obligations to the Non-Defaulting Party under the Contract or otherwise within a period not to exceed forty-eight (48) hours (but at least one (1) Business Day) of a demand therefore when the Non-Defaulting Party has reasonable grounds for insecurity; 
 
(v)           fails to establish, maintain, extend or increase Eligible Collateral when required pursuant to this Contract; then the Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled to exercise the remedies as set forth in this Section 10. 
 
(vi)          suffers the occurrence of a Material Adverse Change; provided, such Material Adverse Change shall not be considered an Event of Default if the Defaulting Party establishes and maintains for so long as the Material Adverse Change is continuing, Eligible Collateral to the Non-Defaulting Party in form and amount acceptable to the Non-Defaulting Party;    
 
(vii)         or the guarantor (if any) of the Defaulting Party fails to perform any covenant set forth in the Guaranty Agreement it delivered in respect of this Contract; or if any representation or warranty made by such guarantor in said Guaranty Agreement shall prove to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or when deemed to be repeated; or if the Guaranty Agreement expires or is terminated or in any way ceases to guarantee the obligations of the Defaulting Party under this Contract; or if such guarantor enters into Bankruptcy whether voluntary or involuntary.
 
the Non-Defaulting Party shall have the right to (a) immediately suspend delivery or payment and/or (b) liquidate and terminate all Transactions entered into pursuant to this Contract and then outstanding between the parties, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Section 10.2 below. In no event shall amounts actually recovered by a Non-Defaulting Party under one subsection of this Article 10 be recovered under another subsection.
 
10.2              In the event a party terminates this Contract under Section 10.1 (""Non-Defaulting Party""), the 
Non-Defaulting Party shall designate an early termination date (""Early Termination Date"").  Such 
Early Termination Date shall be designated within three (3) Business Days after the Non-
Defaulting Party receives knowledge the occurrence of an event of default under Section 10.1 and 
the Non-Defaulting Party shall provide immediate notice of such date to the other party 
(""Defaulting Party"").  Upon the Early Termination Date, the Non-Defaulting Party shall have the 
right to liquidate all Transaction(s) under this Contract (including any portion of a Transaction not 
yet fully delivered) then outstanding by:  (i) Closing out each Transaction being liquidated at its 
Market Value (as defined below) so that each such Transaction is cancelled and a settlement 
payment in an amount equal to the difference between such Market Value and the Contract Value 
(as defined below) of such Transaction shall be due to the Buyer under the Transaction if such 
Market Value exceeds the Contract Value and to the Seller if the opposite is the case; (ii) 
Discounting each amount then due under clause (i) above to net present value in a commercially 
reasonable manner at the time of liquidation (to take account of the period between the date of 
liquidation and the date on which such amount would have otherwise been due pursuant to the 
relevant Transaction); and (iii) Setting off or aggregating, as appropriate, any or all settlement 
payments (discounted as appropriate) and (at the election of the Non-Defaulting Party) any or all 
other amounts owing between the parties under this Contract so that all such amounts are 
aggregated and/or netted to a single liquidated amount payable by one party to the other.  The net 
amount due under any such liquidation shall be paid by the close of business on the third Business 
Day following the Early Termination Date.  For purposes of this Section 10.2 ""Contract Value"" 
means the amount of the Gas remaining to be delivered or purchased pursuant to a Transaction 
multiplied by the price per unit of gas stated in the applicable Transaction, and ""Market Value"" 
means the amount of Gas remaining to be delivered or purchased pursuant to a Transaction 
multiplied by the market price per unit determined by the Non-Defaulting Party in a commercially 
reasonable manner for the delivery or production area, as applicable.  The rate of interest used in 
calculating net present value pursuant to (ii) of this Section 10.2 shall be determined by the Non-
Defaulting Party in a commercially reasonable manner.  The parties agree that this Contract and 
all Transaction under this Section 10.2 shall constitute a ""forward contract"" within the meaning of 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and any other applicable insolvency laws.  The Non-Defaulting Party's 
rights under Section 10 and to those costs under Sections 3 and 4 accrued prior to the Early 
Termination Date are the sole and exclusive remedy of the Non-Defaulting Party.  The Non-
Defaulting Party shall give notice that a liquidation pursuant to this Section 10.2 has occurred to 
the Defaulting Party no later than the time specified above, provided that failure to give such 
notice shall not affect the validity or enforceability of liquidation nor give rise to any claim by the 
Defaulting Party against the Non-Defaulting Party.  With respect to any Transaction, ""the amount 
of the Gas remaining to be delivered or purchased"" shall mean only quantities which the parties 
are obligated as of the Early Termination Date to sell and purchase on a Firm basis during the 
remaining portion of the Delivery Period, which shall include only the period of time to which the 
parties are definitely committed as of the Early Termination Date and shall not include any 
possible but not certain extensions of the term (""evergreen"" provisions, etc.).
 
O.   Section 11.1 is deleted in its entirety and the following new Section 11.1 is inserted in its place:
 
                ""Except with regard to a party's obligation to make payment due under Section 7. and Imbalance 
Charges under Section 4, neither party shall be liable to the other for failure to perform a Firmobligation, to the extent such failure was caused by Force Majeure.  The term ""Force Majeure""as employed herein means an event not anticipated as of the date hereof, which is not within the reasonable control of the Party, or in the case of third party obligations or facilities, the third party, claiming suspension, and which by the exercise of due diligence such Party, or third party, is unable to overcome or obtain or cause to be obtained a commercially reasonable substitute performance therefore.  Subject to the foregoing sentence, events of Force Majeure shall include the events as further defined in Section 11.2 and shall include an event of Force Majeure occurring with respect to the facilities or services of Buyer's or Seller's Transporter.""
 
P.   Section 11.3 is deleted in its entirety and the following new Section 11.3 is inserted in its place:
 
   ""Neither party shall be entitled to the benefit of the provisions of Force Majeure to the extent     
performance is affected by any or all of the following circumstances:  (i) the loss of Buyer's 
                markets or 
Buyer's inability economically to use or resell Gas purchased hereunder, (ii) the loss or 
                failure of 
Seller's Gas supply, including, without limitation, depletion of reserves or other failure 
                of 
production, (iii) Seller's ability to sell Gas to a market at a more advantageous price,(iv) the 
                        
curtailment of interruptible or secondary firm transportation unless primary, in-path, firm 
                        transportation 
is also curtailed; (v) the party claiming excuse failed to remedy the condition and to 
                resume the 
performance of such covenants orobligations with reasonable dispatch; or 
                        (vi) economic hardship.  The 
party claiming Force Majeure shall not be excused from its 
                        responsibility for Imbalance Charges.""
 
M.   Add as Section 11.6:
 
11.6        Any party claiming Force Majeure (the ""Claiming Party"") as an excuse for performance shall 
provide the other party (the Non-claiming Party"") a good faith estimate of the duration of the Force Majeure. Sales or purchases to this Contract and affected by a claim of Force Majeure may be terminated by the Non-claiming Party if such event continues for a period of thirty (30) continuous days.
 
N.    The following paragraph replaces Section 12: 
 
                The term of this Contract shall be month-to-month until terminated on thirty (30) days advance written notice by either party; provided, however, that the provisions hereof shall survive termination of this Contract and continue to apply to any Transactions entered into between Counterparty and Company prior to the date of termination of this Contract until such time as any and all such Transactions are completed or terminated.  . Notwithstanding any termination, the obligation to make payment and provisions of Sections 1.5, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 13.9, 13.10, 13.11, 13.12, 13.14, and 13.5 shall continue to apply.
 
O.    The following paragraphs will be added to Section 13:

There shall be three arbitrators.  Each party shall designate an arbitrator, who need not be neutral, within 30 days of receiving notification of the filing with the AAA of a demand for arbitration.  The two arbitrators so designated shall elect a third arbitrator.  If either party fails to designate an arbitrator within the time specified or the two parties' arbitrators fail to designate a third arbitrator within 30 days of their appointment, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA.  Only damages allowed pursuant to this Agreement may be awarded and the arbitrators shall have no authority to award treble, exemplary or punitive damages of any type under any circumstances regardless of whether such damages may be available under Texas New York law

information disclosed pursuant to Section 7.6 hereof to any third party absent written consent of the 
other party except where (i) disclosure is made to employees of the party or its affiliates,(ii) 
necessary to comply with any applicable law, order, regulation or exchange rule; provided, however, 
that each party shall notify the other party promptly upon receipt of any request to it in any 
proceeding that could result in an order requiring such disclosure and the party subject to such 
request shall use reasonable efforts to prevent or limit such disclosure; or (iii) necessary to effectuate 
transportation of Gas pursuant to this Contract. As a condition to conducting any audit and/or being 
provided with any support documentation pursuant to Sections 7.4 and 7.6 respectively, each party

party, and accordingly  the reviewing party agrees that in the event of such breach the disclosing 
party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief to protect its interest therein, including but not limited 
to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.
 
13.12UCC- Except as otherwise provided for herein, the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code 
(""UCC"") of the state whose laws shall govern this Contract shall be deemed to apply to all 
Transactions

"New Temp IDs","Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and
	then ""Folder List"")

2.	Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab

4.	Left click on ""Add"".
	Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the ""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click ""OK""

5. 	You should now be back in the ""properties"" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the ""Shift"" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has ""own"" or ""owner""
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on ""Apply"", then ""OK"".

6.	Right click on your ""Calendar"" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

"RE: GISB Status","Alisha,

I called a few of the companies that we had not heard from in awhile. Here's what I found:

Coral - They are waiting on us to get back with them on comments that they sent us early September. (Do you have their comments? If not call, Radie Wilson she said she sent them to us twice)
Unocal - Their legal is reviewing our special provisions.
Hess - I left John Crespo a message, but I would like you to follow up with him too. He is a new contact since Shari Ward left so we may have to start over.
Dynegy - Pat Cokes said that he would call Debra, but please ask her if he called. If he did not, please call him and work on the GISB with him.
Mirant - I left Stephanie Tolbert a message. No response yet.
Pan Canadian - I left Rick Tucker a message. No response yet.

I will let you know if I hear back on those that I have left messages. I appreciate your following up on the others.

I am not really concerned about completing GISBs with the counterparties below. I do not know who initiated contact with them. If we get them, great. If we don't, no 
real loss.

AES New Energy
Cypress Natural Gas
Texaco

I appreciate your help. Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Judy

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

>  The Room... beware this is really powerful.
>
> In that place between wakefulness and dreams, I found
> myself in the room. There were no distinguishing
> features except for the one wall covered with small
> index card files.  They were like the ones in  libraries that list titles
by
> author or subject in  alphabetical order. But these files, which stretched
> from floor to ceiling and seemingly endlessly in either direction, had
very
> different headings.
>
> As I drew near the wall of files, the first to catch  my attention was one
> that read:
>
> ""Girls I have liked.""
> I opened it and began flipping through the cards.  I
> quickly shut it, shocked to realize that I recognized
> the names written on each one.
>
> And then without being told, I knew exactly where I
> was.  This lifeless room with its small files was a
> crude catalog system for my life.  Here were written
> the actions of my every moment, big and small, in a
> detail my memory couldn't match.
>
> A sense of wonder and curiosity, coupled with horror,
> stirred within me as I began randomly opening files
> and exploring their content.  Some brought joy and
> sweet memories; others a sense of shame and regret so
> intense that I would look over my shoulder to see if
> anyone was  watching.
>
> A file named ""Friends"" was next to one marked
> ""Friends I have betrayed."" The titles ranged from the
> mundane to the outright weird. ""Books I Have Read,""
> ""Lies I Have Told,"" ""Comfort I have Given,""""Jokes I
> Have Laughed at.""  Some were almost hilarious in their
> exactness:
>
> ""Things I've yelled at my brothers"".  Others I
> couldn't laugh at: ""Things I Have Done in My Anger"",
> ""Things I Have Muttered Under My Breath at My Parents.""
>
> I never ceased to be surprised by the contents. Often
> there were many more cards than I expected.  Sometimes
> fewer than I hoped. I was overwhelmed by the sheer
> volume of the life I had lived. Could it be possible that I had the time
in
> my years to write each of these thousands or even millions of cards?  Each
> card confirmed this truth.  Each was written in my own handwriting.  Each
> signed with my signature.  When I pulled out the file marked ""Songs I have
> listened to,"" I realized the files grew to contain their contents. The
cards
> were packed tightly, and yet after two or three yards, I hadn't found the
> end of the file. I
> shut it, shamed, not so much by the quality of music,
> but more by the vast amount of time I knew that file
> represented.
>
> When I came to a file marked ""Lustful Thoughts,"" I
> felt a chill run through my body. I pulled the file
> out only an inch, not willing to test its size, and
> drew out a card.  I shuddered at its detailed content.
> I felt sick to think! that such a moment had been
> recorded.
>
> An almost animal rage broke on me.
> One thought dominated my mind:  ""No one must ever see
> these cards! No one must ever see this room! I have to
> destroy them!""  In insane frenzy I yanked the file
> out. Its size didn't mattered now. I had to empty it  and burn the cards.
> As I took it at one end and  began pounding it on the floor, I could not
> dislodge a  single card. I became desperate and pulled out a card, only to
> find it as strong as steel when I tried to tear it.  Defeated and utterly
> helpless, I returned the file to  its slot.  Leaning my forehead against
the
> wall, I let out a long, self-pitying sigh.
>
> Then I saw it.  The title bore ""People I Have Shared the Gospel With.""
> The handle was brighter than those around it, newer,
> almost unused. I pulled on its handle and a small box not more than three
> inches long fell into my hands. I  could count the cards it contained on
one
> hand.  Then the tears came.  I began to weep.  Sobs so  deep that the hurt
> started in my stomach! and shook  through me.  I fell on my knees and
cried.
> I cried out  of shame, from the overwhelming shame of it all.  The rows of
> file shelves swirled in my tear-filled eyes.  No one must ever, ever know
of
> this room.  I must lock it up and hide the key.
>
> But then as I pushed away the tears, I saw Him.  No,
> please not Him.  Not here.  Oh, anyone but Jesus.  I
> watched helplessly as He began to open the files and
> read the cards.  I couldn't bear to watch His response.  In the moments I
> could bring myself to look at His face, I saw a sorrow deeper than my own.
> He seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes.  Why  did He have to read
> every one?  Finally He turned and looked at me from across the  room.  He
> looked at me with pity in His eyes.  But  this was a pity that didn't
anger
> me.  I dropped my head, covered my face with my hands and began to cry
> again.  He walked over and put His arm around me. He  could have said so
> many things.  But He didn't say a  word.  He just cried with me. Then He
got
> up and  walked back to the wall of files. Starting at one end  of the
room,
> He took out a file and, one by one, began  to sign His name over mine on
> each card.  ""No!"" I shouted rushing to Him. All I could find to say was
""No,
> no, "" as I pulled the card from Him.  His name
> shouldn't be on these cards. But there it was, written
> in red so rich, so dark, so alive.
>
> The name of Jesus covered mine. It was written with
> His blood.  He gently took the card back. He smiled a
> sad smile and began to sign the cards.  I don't think
> I'll ever understand how He did it so quickly, but the
> next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file
> and walk back to my side. He placed His hand on my
> shoulder and said,   ""It is finished.""
>
> I stood up, and He led me out of the room.  There was
> no lock on its door. There were still cards to be
> written.
>
> ""For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the
> world, but that the world through him might be saved.""
> John 3:17
>
> If you feel the same way forward it to as many people
> as you can so the love of Jesus will touch their lives also.
>
> My ""People I shared the Gospel with"" file just got  bigger; how about
yours?

"Have u seen this?  Actually, pretty good advice.","
 I just got this from my cousin, don't know how true it is, but wanted to
 pass it on just in case.....
 
 Malls on 10/31
 
 This came from my sister Amy...she normally doesn't send forwards, so I
 felt like it was important to get the word out anyway. I think you all
 know
 that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the reactionary thing and send
 out anything that crosses my path. This one, however, is a friend of a
 friend and I've given it enough credibility in my mind that I'm writing it
 up and sending it out to all of you. 
 
 My friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago. She had
 a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably upset
 and went to his home to find it completely emptied. On 9/10, she received
 a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished he could tell her
 why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like that. The part
 worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any commercial
 airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As
 soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since
 turned over the letter.
 
 This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on. This came
 from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night.
 I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being
 correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second
 and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information
 that I did.

I can't really take a long lunch today, but I was thinking of grabbing something downstairs in the cafeteria.  Would you be open?  We can catch up for a little while.

Email me or call me on my cell phone:  (713) 557-9010.

"Public Service Electric and Gas Company - GISB Base Contract Amendment","
Debra,

Regarding the above refenced GISB amendment which I brought up to you this morning (i.e. the amendment with insufficient legal language), here is the contact information:

Shary Walsh Mckay, Contract Manager
E-mail: sharyn.walsh-mcakay@PSEG.com
Phone: (973) 430-6825
Fax #: (973) 623-0328


I also heard from Kim Gentle of Avista Energy, Inc. this morning.  They are the ones who sent back the amendment with the signature line missing.  She said she had talked with you and you were going to mail her an executed amendment for her to sign but she has not yet received it.  She said the signature line seems to get cut off when the amendment is sent to her electronically.   Her phone # is (509) 495-4055 and e-mail address is kgentle@avistaenergy.com.

Here is the link to the GISB, however trade has been terminated on this agreement as it was assigned last year to HPL prior to the sale.  Alisha Mahabir and I are currently negotiating a new GISB with MGI with some difficulty. Also concerning PMI Trading, at present I show only swap agreements with this company.  Marie Heard or Susan Bailey can assist you with swap agreements.  Please give me a call if you wish to discuss this further. I have asked Alisha to give you a call regarding MGI.

Debra,

Please, disregard the e-mail I just sent you on Phillips Gas Marketing Company.  The GISB we need to amend is with Phillips Petroleum Company.  The counterparty called back and drew to my attention that we incorrectly booked our deals under Phillips Gas Marketing Company.  The deals should have been booked under Phillips Petroleum Company and I have communicated same to the Trader.  Details for Phillips Petroleum Company are as follows:

Contact:  Janice White
Contract #: 96029335
E-mail: jgwhite@ppco.com
Phone: (713) 669-7351
Fax:(713) 669-7358

If you notice all the contact information stays the same except for the contract number.

"FW: UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","I wanted to make sure you saw this, I think you are going to have to start using Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com now otherwise your mail will start getting non-deliveries. I'll confirm with the messaging group but it sounds like your first instincts were right.

Sent:	Thursday, October 18, 2001 5:10 PM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses


Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"FW: Thou Shalt not Skim Flavor From the Holidays","GO AHEAD AND LAUGH A LITTLE.  ITS FREE 
This is a good one! 
> THOU SHALT NOT SKIM FLAVOR FROM THE HOLIDAYS  
> By Craig Wilson, USA TODAY 
>  
> I hate this time of year.  Not for its crass  commercialism and forced 
> frivolity, but because  it's the season when the food police come  out 
>  with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the  
> holidays without gaining 10 pounds.  You can't pick  up a magazine 
> without finding a list of holiday  eating do's and don'ts.  Eliminate 
> second  helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies made with butter, they  
> say.  Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say.   Good grief.  Is your 
> favorite childhood memory  of Christmas a carrot stick?  I didn't think 
>  so.  Isn't mine, either.  A carrot was something you left for  Rudolph. 
> I have my own list of tips for holiday  eating.  I assure you, if you 
> follow them,  you'll be fat and happy.  So what if you don't make it to 
> New Year's?  Your pants won't fit anymore, anyway.  
> 
> 1. About those carrot  sticks.  Avoid them.  Anyone who puts carrots on 
> a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit.   In fact, 
> if you see carrots, leave  immediately.  Go next door, where they're 
>  serving rum balls. 
> 
> 2.  Drink as much eggnog as you can.  And quickly.  Like fine  
> single-malt scotch, it's rare.  In fact, it's even  rarer than 
> single-malt scotch.  You can't find  it any other time of year but now. 
> So drink  up!  Who cares that it has 10,000 calories in every sip?  It's  
> not as if you're going to turn into an egg- nogaholic or  something. 
> It's a treat.  Enjoy it.  Have  one for me.  Have two.  It's later than 
>  you think.  It's Christmas! 
> 
> 3. If something comes with gravy, use it.  That's the whole  point of 
> gravy.  Pour it on.  Make a  volcano out of your mashed potatoes.  Fill 
> it  with gravy.  Eat the volcano.  Repeat. 
>  
> 4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're  made with skim milk or 
> whole milk.  If it's  skim, pass.  Why bother?  It's like buying a 
> sports car with an automatic transmission. 
> 
> 5. Do not have a snack before going to  a party in an effort to control 
> your eating.   The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat 
> other people's food for free.  Lots of it.  Hello?   Remember college? 
> 
> 6.  Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New 
> Year's.  You can do that in January when you have nothing else  to do. 
> This is the time for long naps, which you'll  need after circling the 
> buffet table while carrying  a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of 
>  eggnog. 
> 
> 7. If you come  across something really good at a buffet table, like 
> frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa,  position 
> yourself near them and don't budge.   Have as many as you can before 
> becoming the center  of attention.  They're like a beautiful pair of 
> shoes.  You can't leave them behind.  You're not going to  see them 
> again. 
>  
> 8. Same for pies.  Apple.  Pumpkin.   Mincemeat.  Have a slice of each. 
> Or, if you  don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. 
> Always have three.  When else do you get to have more than  one 
> dessert?  Labor Day? 
> 
> 9. Did someone mention fruitcake?   Granted, it's loaded with the 
> mandatory celebratory  calories, but avoid it at all cost.  I mean, have 
> some standards, mate. 
> 
> 10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave  the 
> party or get up from the table, you haven't  been paying attention. 
> Reread tips.  Start  over.  But hurry!  Cookieless January is just 
> around the corner.

"C E Richner - ya1788","Stacy! 

This transaction is a one year deal with one of our Appalachian producers (C E Richner) done by John Singer.  The previous deals were done under contract # 96029815 ( assigned over from Columbia Energy Services), we would like this new deal and all subsequent deals to be done under the Enfolio Gas Purchase Agreement (the one you emailed to me on 10/9). 

Kindly provide Richard Deming with the appropriate documentation.

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

"High School Youth group","
Debra,
Attached is a word document showing the schedule of  high school events through the end of the year.  We will be working on the  spring schedule soon.
 
If your still interested in helping out (I hope you  haven't changed your mind after attending a few meetings) you'll need  to have the ""At Risk"" training.  This training is mandatory for any  adult wishing to work with our youth groups.  I'll check in the office and  see if you can still do this through video or if you have to attend a scheduled  class.
 
I hope that you will be as blessed by working with  the high school kids as I am.

"IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN THE ENRON CORP SAVINGS & ESOP PLANS","
PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Please take this extended opportunity to nominate that special individual who is your everyday hero and a role model who exemplifies Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.

This award represents how important Enron's core values are to the company. The success of this award program is determined by Enron's most valuable asset, you, the employee. Employees at any level can nominate fellow employees from anywhere within the Enron family - from the top down or the bottom up. All of those employees who have been nominated in the past are eligible to be nominated again this year and there is no limit to the number of nominations you may submit. Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by Friday, October 12, 2001. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com and in Houston they are available in the elevator lobbies. In addition, this year we have a new way you can nominate that everyday Enron hero. Simply pick up the phone and dial 713-345-2492, follow the simple and quick instructions and leave your nomination by phone.

The finalists for the award, the Chairman's Roundtable, and the Chairman's Award winner will be honored at Enron's Management Conference in San Antonio on November 15.

 As an update, there is only one issue remaining concerning the agreement, that being Force Majeure.  Also I am waiting on a revision to Dynegy's Guaranty for Nicor.   I have left a message for Mr. Hunt and await his call.  I think we are there just a few minor adjustments.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Veroinca,

Below is some additional information regarding our conversation yesterday on MMS. There are 3 deals in Sitara that capture the deal that Nelson has done that begins November and runs through March (Deal #1103008, 1103884, 1103914). We are working with Gerald Nemec to establish a GISB to cover this deal. We are going to use the same form that was used by Enron North America. 

Please let me know if there is anything else that you need from me.

Nelson, your current GISB is dated 1/1/2001 and is between Enron North
America Corp. and MMS.

When we scored the 2000 financials we used Enron Corp. financial statements.
We can certainly use other Enron subsidiary's financials if you want to
provide them but, if Enron North America Upstream Company LLC is the
purchaser and the only financial statements we have are Enron Corp. we would
like the parental guarantee to be from Enron Corp.


Enclosed is a guarantee that is available on our web page. You can provide
your own if that is more convenient. At a minimum, the guarantee should
cover 60 days volume at current prices and the term should go from the first
delivery date under the contract until  60 days beyond the last delivery
date. In some cases, we have had companies increase the term and value of
the guarantee so that adjustments don't have to be made for subsequent
purchases.

I know that this is additional paperwork. We are trying to streamline things
as much as we can. But, one of the things we have to deal with is making
sure we are consistent with all our purchasers. We appreciate your continued
interest in the MMS RIK program. Let me know if you have any questions. My
phone is 303-275-7224. Sorry for the long winded message. Hope you have a
good weekend.

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Please see the attached 1st draft of pricing language for the Unimark deal # 1062624.  I am not sure about the NX 1 language, (you may want to ask Gerald?).

 

I have a total of 4 deals with Unimark which will use  similar language (with the  5 pricing tiers), so once you approve of this one, I can use it as a templete for the other deals.

thanks so much.  lisa

"RE: Louisville Gas & Electric","Debra, 

My contact said on the first page of the contract he would like ""cover"" checked, not ""spot"" as it now appears.    

That is the last revision requested and if you agree, it should bring this deal to closure.

Debra,

My contact at LG&E has requested the default pricing in the contract be switched from ""spot"" to some type of ""true-cost"" verbiage.  His point was that if he is buying 10,000 on a given day from Enron and ENA only delivers 5,000 by the terms of the present contract Enron would be responsible for the ""spot"" cost of replacement gas or the gas daily average for that zone.  My contact points out that the market for gas when this purchase is to take place could be significantly higher (or lower) than gas daily and that is the cost they want to pay or receive.  

Is something like this request possible?

 The confirmation for the July -Oct transaction with Kenoil has not been signed.   Mr. Flecher does not think he needs to sign this?  Are we purchasing gas? I will resend the confirm to him for signature unless you tell me otherwise.

Also, please remember to advise regarding volumes for the last agreements you sent.

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

"Comments to AES/ENA Master Agreement","
Scott,

Here are some of the comments that we have to the redline version of the Enfolio Master you sent us.  I will designate them by the section number they are assigned in the Master.  Also, there are a few items that we are waiting on our credit department to resolve.  Initially, I would like to clarify some of the basics of the agreement.  Do you anticipate being the buyer or the seller more often under this agreement?  Where is the delivery point?  

All changes from Texas to New York law are acceptable.  

2.2  Why do you want to strike the language ""and acknowledge that each Party will rely thereon in doing business related to the Transaction""?

2.3 This change is acceptable

2.4  We agree that the change from ""may"" to ""shall"", but don't agree to striking the reasonable time for reciept.  Would it be more acceptable to change this to ""Two Business Days""?

3.1  This change is acceptable

3.2 and 3.4  We would like to hold off on these items until for now.

4.1  The changes in this section are acceptable, save the last change which strikes the langauge dealing with affiliates.  We are waiting on credit to ensure that this last change is acceptable.

4.2  This language is not acceptable as we find the language already provided in the Master to be satisfactory.  The clause already makes reference to ""material"" representations

Article 5  You propose to take out the language limiting Force Majeure to 60 days.  Is it your intention that Force Majeure can continue indefinetly?  If not, what time period do you suggest?

6.2  Why do you want to take this section out?  Who will be responsible should new taxes be levied?

7.1  The first change in this paragraph, ""as the Gas passes the receiving manifold..."" is acceptable.  However, the second change, which allows the parties to take negligence into consideration in determining indemnity, is not acceptable.

8.2  The first change is acceptable.   However the language disallowing the parties to transfer, sell, encumber, or assign the Agreement for security purposes is unacceptable.  As for the obligation of a transferring party, we agree that the parties should remain liable on contracts transferred to an affiliate of the company and for transactions which have not been completed.  However, in all other scenarios, the parties should not be liable.

8.3  These changes are unacceptable.  If you could explain your reasoning for the change, perhaps we could reach some middle ground.  

8.4 Would it be more to your liking to change the 60 day requirement to 30 days?

8.9  Could you explain your reasons for the deletion of the language in this section.  The first two sentences and the last sentence added by you are acceptable, however the remaining portions are unacceptable.


If you have any questions regarding these comments, please refer them to Debra Perlingeire.  Here telephone numer is 713-853-7658 and her email is dperlin@enron.com.  

Best regards,

Alisha Mahabir

"RE: Aspect,Helmerick & Payne, Wilmar, etc amendment revision","Debra,

We need to change the pricing verbage. The price should not be 80% of IFHSC. The price for 80% of the volume is IFHSC - .075. Also, the price for the other 20% of the volume is GD - .065 and we should clarify that the GD is Houston Ship Channel. The new well pricing should also be HSC GD - .065. 

Also, I just want to clarify that this pricing is only effective as of January 1, 2002 through the end of the new term. It does not replace or restate the original pricing from the original effective date to the end of 2001. Based on the ""replaces and restates"" and the ""effective date through December 31, 2001"" wording, I was not sure. The other changes are effective from the contract effective date, but not the pricing.

Sorry for the confusion. Let me know if you need further information or if we need to discuss.

Thanks,
Judy

Debra,

I think this is the wrong attachment. It looks to be an amendment with Avista.

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Thank you for sending the WMBE letter for payment
arrangements.  But I forgot to ask you about a follow on
a conversation that we had a few weeks ago about any
language in our Enfolio Agreement that would speak to the
unlikely event that should NDR  go out of business that
the enduser would still receive the natural gas that they
contracted with us for.  This questions is very important
at this time as we are negotiating a term deal with a
major utility in the mid-west. Your timely suggestion or

"Re: GISB Amendment","

Debra,
Do you mind if we make the effective date December 1, 2001?  We've done quite a
few deals under this contract in October and I don't want to have to process new
confirms for this past business.  Additionally, by the time we route the
amendment through our organization, get it signed and back to you, and then
Enron does the same thing, we could be looking at the same problem in November.
Using a 12/1/01 effective date should allow sufficient time for execution by
both sides and getting our systems updated.
Thanks,
Jim

Stacy-
We (Bryant Frihart) have a deal where we have a buy and a sell for the same price, volumes, etc.  Basically it is a wash. However, on the buy, the cp is wanting there receivable in 2002.  The comments in the system read ENA will pay Octagon on January 2, 2002 by wire.  My question is does this have to be worded a certain way on the confirm and if so can you please provide this to me.  Below is the buy for you to view.

Stacy! 

This transaction is a one year deal with one of our Appalachian producers (C E Richner) done by John Singer.  The previous deals were done under contract # 96029815 ( assigned over from Columbia Energy Services), we would like this new deal and all subsequent deals to be done under the Enfolio Gas Purchase Agreement (the one you emailed to me on 10/9). 

Kindly provide Richard Deming with the appropriate documentation.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"West Virginia title received","Okay, all.  I am sure there is a very good deal behind this, but do any of you know where the recently received, state of West Virginia title to a used trailer belongs?  The year of the trailer is 1995, the make of the trailer is ""NORS"", and the serial number is N01020318TN.  The title was issued by WV on 09/26/01 to Enron North America Corp., no lienholder (well, that's a good fact!).

Please ask around your groups regarding who is interested in holding on to this title.  Unless otherwise notified, I am going to have it sent to the vault.  Please call me if you know to whom it should be directed.

Subject:	The Enemy

From Prevention's stress columnist, Pam Peeke, MD

Take all American women who are within five years of menopause - train us for a few weeks, outfit us with automatic weapons, grenades, gas masks,
moisturizer with SPF15, Prozac, hormones, chocolate, and canned tuna, drop us (parachuted, preferably) across the landscape of Afghanistan, and let us do what comes naturally.

Think about it.  Our anger quotient alone, even when doing standard stuff like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable enough to make even armed men in turbans tremble.

We've had our children, we would gladly suffer or die to protect them and their future.  We'd like to get away from our husbands, if they haven't left already.  And for those of us who are single, the prospect of finding a good man with whom to share life is about as likely as being struck by lightning.  We have nothing to lose.

We've survived the water diet, the protein diet, the carbohydrate diet, and the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across America and never lost a pound.  We can easily survive months in the hostile terrain of Afghanistan
with no food at all!

We've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware stores, or sporting events...finding bin Laden in some cave will be no
problem.

Uniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government?  Oh, please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and extended families at Thanksgiving dinners for years ... we understand tribal warfare.

Between us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick there is
for how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money sources.
We know how to find that money and we know how to seize it ... with or
without the government's help!

Let us go and fight.  The Taliban hates women.  Imagine their terror as we
crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain.

I'm going to write my Congresswoman.  You should, too!

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"Enron's Master Firm Sales Agreement","Debra:

I have briefly discussed some of the issues concerning the changes we feel
are appropriate with your diversity program: Ms. Hunter, Mr. Eakins, Ms.
Medcalf.  They were interested about in my reasoning behind the suggested
changes.  I realize their could or will be different verbiage concerning my
change's; however, the intent is firm because of the standard GISB payment
dates previously agreed upon as well as anticipated payment date for other
Resale Customers.

I am assuming there is little room for negotiation as the agreement format
requirement of the Buyer?

Please advise me of your comments concerning the changes so as we can move
forward. I have been asked to keep the Diversity people informed of my
progress so I am copying Ms. Hunter on this E-Mail.

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

Gerald, I attach a copy of the current form of master physical gas agreement ECC has in place with CNR.  Randy will send you a credit worksheet in the next half hour.  Can you make sure that your form of master has the triangular setoff language that Mark Haedicke distributed a month or so ago to be included in all agreements, as CNR wants to ensure there is cross-affiliate setoff.  Once it is prepared, Howard Sangwine, the commercial contact in Calgary, will walk the document over to CNR, so you can send it to me and I will get it to him.

Thanks for your help.

Greg

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

Have you heard anything from Gerald about the contracts?  The deal is almost

All,

We are currently working on the data model for the Trading Agreements System and have a question pertaining to internal/external counterparties.  Are all agreements between an internal company(counterparty) and an external company(counterparty)?  I spoke with Meredith Stewart (the data architect for this project) and she found an agreement between 2 internal counterparties, e.g. Enron Louisiana and ECT.

Please let me know ASAP.

I can't really take a long lunch today, but I was thinking of grabbing something downstairs in the cafeteria.  Would you be open?  We can catch up for a little while.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Here is the link to the GISB, however trade has been terminated on this agreement as it was assigned last year to HPL prior to the sale.  Alisha Mahabir and I are currently negotiating a new GISB with MGI with some difficulty. Also concerning PMI Trading, at present I show only swap agreements with this company.  Marie Heard or Susan Bailey can assist you with swap agreements.  Please give me a call if you wish to discuss this further. I have asked Alisha to give you a call regarding MGI.

"Important Information About Security & ClickAtHome","
Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.  
BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.
If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email clickathome@enron.com.  Thank you for your participation in ClickAtHome.
The ClickAtHome Team!
__________________________________

"Octagon Resources, Inc.","Stacy-
We (Bryant Frihart) have a deal where we have a buy and a sell for the same price, volumes, etc.  Basically it is a wash. However, on the buy, the cp is wanting there receivable in 2002.  The comments in the system read ENA will pay Octagon on January 2, 2002 by wire.  My question is does this have to be worded a certain way on the confirm and if so can you please provide this to me.  Below is the buy for you to view.

 
Thanks

	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"", 
			please indicate either course #7129-00 (Tuesdays) or # 7129-01 (Thursdays).  
If you wish, you may indicate one course as your first choice and the other as your second choice.

the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
The next courses at the Princeton Review office start the week of October 20.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"RE: UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","No, as most of this sounds like it will be done on the back-end, what you will probably need to tell people is that instead of emailing to the address you have been giving them, email instead to Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com. It will get routed automatically.

I wanted to make sure you saw this, I think you are going to have to start using Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com now otherwise your mail will start getting non-deliveries. I'll confirm with the messaging group but it sounds like your first instincts were right.

Subject:	UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses


Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

agree to the option to terminate the Transaction after the 60 day period
provided damages if any as stated in Article 3. have been paid plus the

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

EXPLORE AFGHANISTAN
 Learn about the landscape, history, people and ethnicities of Afghanistan

this program was to present Mr. Abdullah Ayazi, ""The Map Man"", but he had
to cancel, and sends his apologies.  Mr. Shafi is his colleague and
co-presenter and is perhaps even better qualified to speak about the
current situation as well as the history.  He began working for the BBC at
age 15, translating, escorting correspondents to the front lines, and
arranging interviews with government officials.  He became a journalist in
his own right, and has also worked with Healthnet International on refugee
issues.  Maxwell Museum North Gallery.  Refreshments will be served.  Mr.

"WENH Holiday Charity Gala","Dear WENH members,

Each year, WENH holds a holiday charity luncheon benefitting women or
children in the Greater Houston area.  This year's event will be held on
Friday, December 7, at 11:30 a.m. at the Houstonian.  We are excited to
announce that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison will be the keynote speaker at
this year's event.  The Senator will discuss energy issues and provide an
update from Capitol Hill.  At the end of her speech, WENH will present her
with an award for her contribution to the energy industry.

This year's beneficiary is Girls Inc. of Greater Houston.  Girls Inc. is a
wonderful organization that helps girls from all walks of life become
strong, smart, and bold in order to achieve their full potential.  Proceeds
from the event will help fund such programs as Operation S.M.A.R.T., which
gives girls hands-on experience with math, science, and technological
applications.  Sixty percent of the girls that are served belong to racial
and ethnic minority groups; more than fifty percent of the girls come from
families living below the poverty level; and over half are from single
parent households, most of which are headed by women.

You will soon receive a fund-raising packet in the mail.  Please take a few
minutes and forward it to the partners in your firm, your charitable
contributions, governmental affairs, public affairs, and/or human resources
departments, or other  decision-makers as appropriate.

We will mail the event invitations in early November.  Individual ticket
prices are $60 for WENH members and $75 for guests.   We anticipate a
sell-out, so after you have received your invitation, please remit your
payment at your earliest convenience.  Due to the large number of people we
are expecting, walk-ins will not be accepted and any cancellations will be
considered donations to Girls Inc.

The Houstonian will be beautifully decorated for the holidays, and the
ballroom has recently been remodeled.  So, mark your calendars and join us
for our charity gala!  This is one event you won't want to miss!

Special Events Director

"RE: GISB Amendment - Xcel Energy Inc.","Ms. Osire,

The Amendment is not correct.  As I have told you repeatedly, Northern
States Power Company is still the contracting party, not Xcel Energy Inc.
Xcel Energy Inc. is the holding company which owns Northern States Power
Company, however the utility still contracts and operates in its own name as
an operating utility company.  We cannot execute the Amendment until it
correctly states the parties to the Agreement.

"RE: CILCO","They are correct, Cilco city gate does not exist....the only reference point is the Nicor city gate.  As far as the guarant, I'm okay, but the last time we asked them to draft the guarantee, it was horrible.  I'll ask them to send us a draft.

Call me when you get a chance.

Subject:	CILCO


 Regarding the GISB,  issues remaining are Section 3.2 Performance Obl. and their Guaranty.

We prefer Spot Standard for Section 3.2 however, they argue the Cilco city gate does not have a ""Spot Market"" .  If the city gate is their end user I will give on this point.  Tammy is checking on this.  The only other issue is their Guaranty to Enron.  I have no problem with amending the gty or putting a new one in place.  Having said that, I would prefer they draft the amendment.  This of course is contingent on credits ok with the change in the gty amount.

FYI, I will be out to the office tomorrow afternoon for meetings. If you need me leave a message with my assistant and I will call you back.

"Correct Legal Name of Your Company","I work in the Legal Department for Lisa Herrmann at RWE Trading Americas
Inc.  I am trying to find out the correct legal name of your company
that would enter into a natural gas purchase/sales contract and a power
purchase/sale contract.  Also, I am looking for the correct legal name
of the company, if any, that will provide a guaranty.

I am also trying to find out who within your company handles the
contract documentation for the power contracts.  I would like to get
their name, phone number, fax number and email address.  Is this
something you could help me with?

Thanks for your help.

Dear Friends and Family,
We wanted to let you know that baby Rebekah Ruth Moats was born by cesarean
section on 10 January at 10:00 a.m.  She was 20.4 inches long and 7 lb. 15
oz in weight.  Both Mommy and baby are doing well.  No signs of jaundice
with this child.  Ruthie and Rebekah will stay in Kediri until after
Rebekah's two-week check-up.  Jeff and Naomi and Esther will head back to
Jember as soon as we receive the birth certificate so that we can register
the baby with the American Consulate.  We thank you for your prayers.

Grateful For the Gift of Life,
Jeff For All

"Your Role in Computer Virus Protection","As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Got your message today, thanks.  I spent my gift certificate at Urban Retreat and now I am exhausted.  Too much beauty in one day!!  Tomorrow I have to go to MDA to my onocologist.  I am doing well except for the food issues.  I have lost 17 pounds because I still have alot of nausea.  I am sure it will pass soon and all the weight will come pouring back on!!!  Hope you are doing OK and not working yourself to death.  Take care and talk to you soon.

America's surefire plan to defeat the terrorists. 

Take all American women who are within five years of menopause - train 
us 
for a few weeks, outfit us with automatic weapons, grenades, gas masks, 
moisturizer with SPF15, Prozac, hormones, chocolate, and canned tuna - 
drop 
us (parachuted, preferably) across the landscape of Afghanistan, and let 
us 
do what comes naturally. 

Think about it.  Our anger quotient alone, even when doing standard 
stuff 
like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable enough to make 
even 
armed men in turbans tremble. 

We've had our children, we would gladly suffer or die to protect them 
and 
their future.  We'd like to get away from our husbands, if they haven't 
left already.  And for those of us who are single, the prospect of 
finding 
a good man with whom to share life is about as likely as being struck by 

lightning.  We have nothing to lose. 

We've survived the water diet, the protein diet, the carbohydrate diet, 
and 
the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across America and never lost a 
pound.  We can easily survive months in the hostile terrain of 
Afghanistan 
with no food at all! 

We've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware 

stores, or sporting events...finding bin Laden in some cave will be no 
problem. 

Uniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government?  Oh, 
please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and 
extended 
families at Thanksgiving dinners for years ... we understand tribal 
warfare. 

Between us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick there is 
for 
how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money sources.  We 

know how to find that money and we know how to seize it ... with or 
without 
the government's help! 

Let us go and fight.  The Taliban hates women.  Imagine their terror as 
we 
crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain. 

I'm going to write my Congresswoman.  You should, too!

"NOTICE TO: All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan","TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.

Gerald and Judy,

Shawyne Smith has made the following deals with Unimark LLC   pooled and committed wells ( 1063501, 1033968, and 1063576 ) which include pricing language with 5 separate tiers for maximum volumes of 4275/d.
How should we confirm these deals?  We have language to confirm 2 pricing tiers.  

Judy how should we proceed to confirm these deals?  Should we start this trend of multiple pricing tiers for such small volumes?

Please let me know how we should proceed.

"WENH January Meeting...","MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT:

ANNUAL MEETING AND ELECTION OF 2002 WENH BOARD

Dear Members:

The  annual meeting of the Women's Energy Network of Houston is normally
held at the November or December luncheon meeting.  This year, however, WENH 
held two out-of-the-ordinary events in November and December that precluded
the annual meeting from being held in those months.  WENH's bylaws provide
that ""if the December meeting is not held, the annual meeting shall be held
at the next WENH meeting.""  Accordingly, the WENH Board of Directors has
scheduled the annual meeting to be held at our January luncheon meeting at
Brennan's Restaurant, 3300 Smith St., on January 9, 2002, at 12:00 p.m.

At the annual meeting, the WENH membership in attendance will elect the
Officers and Directors of the WENH Board of Directors for 2002.  No WENH
member may vote by proxy.  Following careful deliberation of all nominated
candidates, the Nominating Committee, composed of Leesa Foster, President;
Robin Dyer, Immediate Past President; Lisa Craig, Vice President and
retiring Board member; Meg Healy, WENH member; and Karyl Lawson, WEHN member
(with Denise Cassata, WENH member, as a substitute at the Nominating
Committee's final meeting) hereby announces its recommended slate for the
upcoming elections at the annual meeting, as follows:

2002 WENH Board Nominations
