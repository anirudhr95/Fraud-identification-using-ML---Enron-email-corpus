Andy --

If that is the case, for the example we went through yesterday, the
transport cost would be:

(NYMEX offer + Amarillo offer)*(1/(1- fuel ratio)) + commodity charge
(2.80 -0.05)*(1/(1-0.0319)) + 0.0167
2.75*1.0329 + 0.0167 = $2.86

How do you compare this transport cost to the spread between Amarillo and
Chicago basis and index (12 cents) to decide whether to transport?

Thanks!
Ann

   Andy --

   I have a couple of questions as I dive more into the details of figuring
   out transportation costs. Still trying to figure out how you make your
   decision whether to transport or not.  You compare the cent spread
   between
   the Amarillo(offer) and Chicago basis(bid)+Nicor Index(bid) versus the
   transportation cost.  In the numbers you provided in your example, the
   spread was 12 cents.  I'm still confused as to how you compute the
   transportation cost to compare that spread with. The fuel ratio you
   specified was 3.19% and the commodity was $0.0167.

   Thanks,
   Ann

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these spaces.

Did you know that the 3rd Quarter of 2001 was the worst performance in the Market since 1987???  That is, unless you had Indigo. 
Last week was one of the best ""up weeks"" for the Market since 1984 !!!!!!!!! 
Did you know when to BUY and catch the move?  Indigo users did. 
You thought you were confused before!  What is an investor to do? 
One Word- INDIGO 
Indigo - The same easy to use trading system Individual Investors have used for years.  A few minutes each day and a few clicks of your mouse....that's all you have to do.  Indigo does the rest as the most powerful trading system available. 
Indigo has been around longer.  Indigo's track record stands alone. 
Most of us have read all the investment books that say the same thing- 
They all agree that the time to buy is when others are panicking. That's right up there with that phrase to ""buy low and sell high"".  We all know that but for some reason, individual investors found it was just more comforting buying when stocks like YHOO and AMZN were going up 10-15 points each day.  The Market has changed and we must change with it.   
Individual Investors have questioned almost daily if they are ready to make the decision to get back into the Market and start trading again.  Trading is the key.  You have to keep up with what the Market is doing and that can become a full time job.   
Indigo is still available for you.  It still takes only minutes per day.  It still remains strong with a performance you can look at for FREE.  Give us a call and in a few minutes, that's all it will take, you will see why Indigo is the key to your getting back into the market and knowing when to BUY, SELL, and HOLD.   
Give us 10 minutes, and we'll prove it to you.

Greg,

One of my concerns regarding the merger is future compensation.  It is well known throughout the industry that Dynegy pays the lowest bonuses.  What incentive do we have to make money next year knowing bonuses in 2002 will be abysmal?  For that matter, what guarantees will be made in order to prevent a massive exodus next year for this reason?

Thank you for your attention,

Andy

Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes have already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders).  

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 16th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

 Karen.

Please let us know if you received this email by mistake.  If you've told us, and you haven't been removed, please leave your email address that it was sent to because that may have been the problem.   Thank you.  admin@telesto-inc.net << File: mailto:admin@telesto-inc.net >> 
     
I just wanted to pass a note to you because I wanted to clear up the skepticism about my trading system.     
     Psychology is 90% of the markets.  Just look at how the markets react all the time to news or consumer confidence.  Trading that psychology is key, and this is why my profits are so consistent. 
     
     Every month my gap trading system makes money in an up or down market.  What I am teaching uses psychology to its highest degree.  I teach you the most optimal time to take advantage of bargain-hunting and profit-taking, the most psychologically influenced aspects of the market.  This really keeps you out of losing gap trades because you need a way to filter them out.  You don't have to put your opinion in which trade to take.
 
          I'm sure it is not what I am charging for my system that makes you skeptical.  After all, you already know you can get a refund.  It is probably the doubt that it can continue, so why waste your time, right?  I have given you profitable updates frequently, but you may still find it difficult to believe it will continue.   So, here is my thought... 
    
     Just take the step to ""watch"".  You really don't need the time commitment because I will show you everything.  You just have to read the 60 page manual, and I will take care of the rest.  I will spend the time to show you.  Log onto your computer in the mornings and look for my emails.  I'll give you the trades and so forth.  Watching these trades to see how they react is the proof to everything that I am telling you.  I have no problem spending as much time as you need to make this work for you too.
 
     If you have questions feel free to ask me.    http://www.gatg.net
 
Best Regards,
 
Antonio

WSJ(1/14) UBS Emerges As Top Bidder For Enron Trading Unit 		

01/14/2002
Dow Jones News Services
(Copyright ? 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)


  By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

UBS AG, the giant Swiss financial firm, emerged the apparent victor to acquire Enron Corp.'s North American energy-trading operation. Enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business, once the generator of 90% of the Houston company's profit. 

But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable, as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders -- UBS and Citigroup Inc. Enron wouldn't see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year, indicating how difficult it will be for the energy company's creditors to recover what they are owed. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, the largest such filing ever, shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize. 

Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to bankruptcy-court approval, Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg, the investment banking arm of UBS, its wholesale energy-trading operation, including a staff of roughly 800 people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform. UBS wouldn't be acquiring any of Enron's huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound. It also wouldn't provide any cash upfront to Enron. 

Instead, UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the energy-trading enterprise's pretax profit for a 10-year period, according to Enron. UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to Enron of money in years three, four and five. UBS would pay Enron 5.75 times Enron's prior-year payment for each one-third share of royalty eliminated. As such, it could completely eliminate Enron's royalty payments by the end of the fifth year. 

As incentive to buy out Enron, UBS's royalty payments otherwise would increase by 10% from years five through 10, up to a maximum of 44% share of pretax profit. 

Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said yesterday that he felt it was a ""grand-slam great deal"" for creditors since new life is being breathed into a ""perishable commodity."" Enron's staff had been kept together largely on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of February. The trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to Enron's Chapter 11 filing last month. 

Enron had hoped to bring in a credit-worthy partner to take a 51% stake in a new trading joint venture, leaving the energy company with a 49% stake. But Mr. McMahon said no bidder was interested in that deal. There also were no bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energy-trading companies. One possible reason was that resuscitating Enron's vast trading business would require a top credit rating, lots of capital to back trading operations and an expert credit-risk department to keep track of what traders are doing and to constantly revalue the trading book. 

Since the Enron debacle, other energy-trading firms have taken pains to show they are de-emphasizing commodity-like trading of electricity, which Enron pioneered, and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of energy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price volatility. 

Mr. McMahon said he feels that ""by virtue of a AA-plus bank purchasing this business, it changes the landscape of the energy-merchant business forever"" by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings. UBS apparently hasn't committed to provide any set level of capital. There is no determination, yet, for how royalty payments would be divided among Enron's thousands of creditors. 

The largest question, though, is whether the trading business can truly be revived. Although Enron's global wholesale division, which included as its biggest component the North American energy-trading operations, generated about $3 billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of 2001, it has been dormant now for more than a month. Martin Bienenstock, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer, characterized the deal as ""the sale of something that was dead that we are trying to bring back to life."" 

Competitors say they think a certain amount of Enron's trades were conducted at very thin margins in order to build volume, and that such trading practice likely will disappear. ""You'll see the churn going away,"" says Michael McNally, chief financial officer of TXU Corp., now the biggest electricity trader in Texas. He thinks EnronOnline has ""significant value but there's only a limited number of people who would know how to use it."" Scaled to transact trades on hundreds of types of contracts, the platform is oversized for most uses. 

UBS Warburg, which bought PaineWebber in 2000, has looked to expand its U.S. market share, and the Enron deal would provide entry into energy trading. John Costas, chief executive of UBS Warburg, said Friday the Enron unit would be ""a valuable extension of our world-wide trading activities."" 

The winner of the auction, held under the bankruptcy court's supervision, was announced shortly after noon Friday in a packed Manhattan courtroom, less than an hour after the two bidders had submitted final offers. Enron's advisers and its creditors committee, which endorsed the UBS deal, had negotiated nonstop for more than 24 hours. In addition to Citigroup, which Mr. McMahon said competed ""neck and neck"" with UBS, BP PLC, the British oil company, had submitted a $25 million bid for the computer settlement support system of the Enron unit. 

The proposed UBS transaction is subject to approval by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, who officially closed the auction to new bidders Friday. A hearing is set for Thursday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections. 

Separately Friday, Judge Gonzalez declined to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston, denying motions from several creditors who had argued that Enron's headquarters city was a more suitable venue.

	AyyyyyMayyyyy,

	How was your trip?  I hope you were able to get lots of sleep.  Huy tried to get me to go drinking last night, but I was far too tired.  I didn't get done with interviews 	until after 7:00 PM.  Trang said you told her to take care of me while you were gone.  I thought that was very sweet, yet I can't help wondering if you think I can not 	take care of myself (that was a joke by the way). 

	Kelly sent me Linda's numbers with plenty of attitude.  She mentioned something about you having an abundance of time while she has a scarcity of time.  But you 	can't tell her I told you.  

	Looks like I gotta go.  I miss you, and look forward to hearing from you.

	Love,

	Andy
