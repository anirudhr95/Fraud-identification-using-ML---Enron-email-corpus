Jim,

There is a lot of confusion over the scope and scale of services that the estate will require from UBS over the next several months.  During the negotiations over the Transistion Services Agreement, it was clearly contemplated that the estate will need UBS to schedule and purchase power as an agent of the estate.  However, most of the UBS team does not understand or expect to provide these types of services.  I know that you have coordinated with Greg Whalley but I feel it is necessary that we have a broader coordination meeting between the two organizations.  I think this meeting needs to happen at your level.

Thanks,

Paul

Marcello is coming to Houston tomorrow to interview for a position trading financial gas.  I really think if we have any spare trading slots we should talk to him.  Kevin - what about South East power?

"FW: Power Fundamentals","FYI below.

Not sure if telling Tim this is OK is high on Whalley's list.  You were more directly involved in this sort of thing.  Could you tell Tim that a copy will remain with Enron and we need to get that done ASAP since transition and duplication is currently going on?

Thanks.

FYI below.  Understand your concern.  I asked McMahon and/or Delainey to ask Whalley to give you the OK.

My interpretation:

Enron does own all the applications that were ever developed over the years, including all fundamentals, and the list of those applications that Enron owns and is licensing to UBS is on schedule 27.4, which I think includes the apps on West Fundamentals.  If they are not on schedule 27.4, then they are by definition still owned by Enron and we keep them and they are not licensed to UBS.  

Then these applications, that are labeled Proprietary Software and are licensed to UBS, are then sub-licensed back to Enron in the exhibits to the Comprehensive License Agreement in the Enron Field of Use, which is described in section 7.1 of the CLA.

Either way, Enron either owns the application(s) or has a sub license back in its Field of Use in the Gas and Power business.

I also asked Anne Koehler in legal about this issue and she agrees with my interpretation.  She and Lance Schuler helped write a substantial portion of the agreements and is scheduled to go to work for UBS.

If you still want Whalley to say OK, I understand.

Thanks.

See below.  

Tell Whalley and Belden today that we own these applications and need our copy.  We want to send estate people to Portland ASAP to get our working version on an Enron owned server.

Thanks.

Greg-The Power Fundamentals applications are owned by Enron and, along with all the other Enron developed software, will be licensed to UBS on an exclusive basis for use in the North American Power and Gas business.  UBS will then sublicense these applications back to Enron for use by Enron within the permitted ""Enron Field of Use"".  The Enron Field of Use is described in Section 7.1 of the Comprehensive License Agreement and includes all the activities that Enron is allowed to pursue within the North American Power and Gas business.  

Further more, under the Comprehensive License Agreement, Enron is required to maintain and protect any Trade Secrets relating to the Gas and Power Business and to the proprietary software developed by Enron.  See Section 16.9 to the Comprehensive License Agreement.

Give me your opinion on Tim Belden's issue below please.  

Schedule 27.4 lists power fundamentals applications and the CLA says that the Enron Parties are licensing it to UBS.  I also talked with Bob Hillier on this and he agreed with me and said that the Enron Parties own everything and the schedule lists what we are licensing to UBS.  West Power Fundamentals was developed by the Enron Parties and is owned by the Enron Parties.

Let me know your thoughts.

Hi Beth,
I hate to be uncooperative, particularly after all that we have accomplished together, but I can't see where in the Enron/UBS agreement it says that Enron needs or gets to keep the West Power Fundamentals system.  Furthermore, I have no assurances that Enron is in a position to keep this information confidential as Richard Schweiger is rightfully looking for a new job.  Richard could easily understand what we are doing and use it to secure a job with AEP, Pacificorp or someone else here in town.  I don't mean to question Richard's integrity, but these are very strange times.

Until I receive word from UBS or Greg Whalley I am sitting tight.

Again, sorry to be uncooperative, but it doesn't appear to me that our interests are aligned right now and I need to protect our competitive advantage.

Regards,
Tim

All,

I have been requested to obtain a working copy of all fundamental systems.  The estate wants to preserve them and they should be available for use within the estate.

I will dedicate systems resources to working with your groups.  Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

I will have Richard Burchfield coordinate these efforts.  Richard Schweiger will assist us in Portland.

Thanks,
Beth

"two additional headcount","Louise, 

The following  employees currently working on the floor but have not received offers from UBS and are still on the estate payroll

Amy Shewster (sp?)-receptionist.  She is needed not only to direct and answer calls but for security purposes.
Jessie Villareal-clerk/runner.  Jessie is the only clerk on the floor and is apparently filling a very vital role.  T Jae Black (power), Ina Rangel (gas) and Liz all agree that we need him long term.  

We have two options:
1.  Leave them on estate payroll and ask for them to be seconded to UBS for a period of time
2.  Give them UBS offers-I would need to do this tomorrow morning in order to get in before deal close.

Let me know what you would like to do.  Thanks much.

"Web Services Reality Conference - Call for Presenters","CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT & CALL FOR PRESENTERS:
Web Services Reality - Spring 2002  (April 1 - June 30,  2002)

Louise,

The Intellor Group is calling for presenters who wish to deliver a track session at ""Web Services Reality - Spring 2002""

Find out how you can participate as a Track Presenter
http://www.intellor.com/links/?pg=WSRP

Intellor Group announces ""Web Services Reality - Spring 2002"" a unique, first of its kind, virtual conference paradigm for educating IT professionals!

Web Services is undoubtedly the number one strategic technology direction that you need to be informed about in 2002.  Web Services Reality - Spring 2002 will offer thought-leading content to IT professionals worldwide through a state-of-the-art virtual classroom environment.

This is the first in a new ""Reality"" series of virtual conferences - conferences that are delivered entirely over the Internet, where attendees can be full interactive participants without leaving the office. The conference emphasis and tone is on getting the real unvarnished truth on new technologies and avoiding hype. Keynotes, in-depth tutorials, and track sessions are delivered by industry thought-leaders and IT practitioners with early-adopter experience.

Web Services Reality is aimed at IT professionals who want to understand the latest technologies for solving real-world e-Business integration problems. Track sessions will have a common context of:
- including case-study, technology demonstration or 'lessons learned' material
- delivering practical 'how-to-apply' information rather than bland discussion of technologies
- occasionally challenging conventional wisdom with discussion of new, pioneering, potentially controversial, techniques or technology applications.

Find out how you can participate as a Track Presenter without having to spend days out of the office or fight for limited education and travel dollars.  http://www.intellor.com/links/?pg=WSRP

For more information on ""Web Services Reality - Spring 2002""
Visit http://www.intellor.com/links/?pg=WSR

Participate in this ground-breaking event and gain worldwide recognition for your knowledge and experience!  This call for presenters closes on January 18, 2002, so be sure to submit your application soon.

Conference Chairman

OK

Who is the individual responsible for making sure that 600 plus people will read the 9 pages of protocol and will also verify and collect a signed certification from every new UBS employee by this Friday?  Who will collect Enron's copy of these and hold them and is someone coordinating with UBS directly?

How would you describe (in terms that a regulator would understand) what is transfered to UBS?  I am asking because I want to make sure that I have a good grasp of what is going to UBS before our FERC pre-meeting.

My understanding is that we are providing software code to is used (a) for all backoffice applications and (b) for a trading platform.  Anything else?

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

    I am not comfortable being assigned as a contact person or anything else in connection with this since I don't understand what I am supposed to be doing and nobody has bothered to explain it to me. Before you circulate this, would someone please let me know exactly what this is so we can determine if I am the appropriate person to be involved? Thanks.

Hi Joy,

Louise Kitchen has requested me to have access to her calendar, contacts and Inbox.  I need to have the ability to create, delete and edit appoints in her calendar.  I need to be able to review and reply to emails on her behalf.   Louise wants to confirm that only Tammie Schoppe and myself  have access to her calendar, contacts and inbox.  Please  do a thorough search to be sure no one else can view her information, including those in the London office.  Call me should you have any questions.


Many Thanks,

We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.
 
Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate)
 
Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation
January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer)
January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process
 
It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.
 
Thanks
 
Louise

Subject:	Priority Customer List

Attached is the customer priority list.

This is intended to be the ""pre-approved"" list for companies to be ready on launch day and includes US and Canadian entities in gas and power.

I have most recently been told that individual legal names are not wanted in this list - only group names. If individual legal names are needed, let me know - I can provide the list that way as well.

Note that there are about 25 more names on this list than the list previously supplied to credit. It appears a number of Canadian companies some non-online companies were not included in the original list. This most recent list includes these names and provides an order of priority for them.

I will be sending another list later, which will identify the type of Master Agreement priority for each (ISDA, Physical Gas, Physical Power)

Dave

Just a couple of suggested changes to both.

There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership structure of the entity.  Enron had previously announced that the entiy would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.

 
On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed that sentence.
 
Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a particular reason?

Thanks

Louise

Attached for your review are drafts of two news releases, one announcing the closing of the UBS Warburg / Energy
transaction and the other to announce the launch of UBSWenergy.com. The plan is to issue the closing announcement on
Friday (2/8) at about 8 a.m. New York time. The other is planned for when the website officially launches, which is
expected on Monday (2/11).

Please forward your comments directly to David P. Walker, head of Media Relations-Americas, sometime on Wednesday.

Tomorrow, I will send you drafts of the internal announcements for Friday and Monday. The plan is to issue on Friday a
global UBS Warburg email announcement from John Costas, announcing the new management. I need from Human Resources
confirmed titles for Louise Kitchen, John Lavorato and Kevin Presto. In addition, we plan for Friday an email from Greg
Whalley to employees who have signed on with UBS Warburg Energy, with Costas's announcement attached. (Both will also be
posted on UBS Warburg intranets, including the integration site.) There will also be internal publicity on the day the
website launches: another email from Whalley to Energy employees and intranet articles within UBS Warburg, including the
integration site.

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,

Claudia

Jim,

There is a lot of confusion over the scope and scale of services that the estate will require from UBS over the next several months.  During the negotiations over the Transistion Services Agreement, it was clearly contemplated that the estate will need UBS to schedule and purchase power as an agent of the estate.  However, most of the UBS team does not understand or expect to provide these types of services.  I know that you have coordinated with Greg Whalley but I feel it is necessary that we have a broader coordination meeting between the two organizations.  I think this meeting needs to happen at your level.

Thanks,

Paul

The old building is a really bad idea due to the press etc - when it ends things will be easier.  But currently moral would be ahuge issue moving to the old building.

Subject: Real estate issues re: UBSW Energy, LLC in Houston




Hello Pat, Louise, Dave

The UBSW real estate department is reviewing the current/future lease

terms for UBSW Energy LLC, in Houston.  According to Brian Dugan, our

lead real estate guy on the bank side, the building owner has offered

a nine month lease to stay in the South Tower on the 5th and 6th

floors.  After the nine months we will be offered the option to sign

up for an additional 18 months but we could be moved down to floors 3

and 4.  Is this a significant issue?  I understand that the 3rd and

4th floor foot prints are similar to 5/6.

If UBSW Energy is willing to relocate to the North Tower, they can

get a lease for 5-9 years but this tower may be less suitable.  What

are the issues here?

The integration real estate team plans to meet this afternoon with

the Bank's outside legal firm we use for real estate issues.  We have

a target date of this Friday to try to resolve all real estate issues

in order to meet the DAY 0 legal integration date of 2/6/02.

Your thoughts please.

Mark

USA:
IPE natural gas trade first to move to ICE.
By Gelu Sulugiuc

02/05/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The European natural gas business on London's
International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) will be the first to migrate onto the
electronic platform of IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) following the merger of
the two exchanges, IPE Chief Executive Richard Ward told a news briefing.

""We will move our natural gas business, which is electronically traded, onto
the ICE platform as soon as possible,"" Ward said. He added that the move will
likely be done in the second or third quarter of this year.
ICE, an Atlanta-based energy and metals Internet trading platform, took over
the IPE last year in a bid to create a global electronic platform for trading
futures and ""over-the-counter"" (OTC) products. OTC trades are those done
outside regular open-outcry exchanges.

The U.S. exchange plans eventually to transfer all of IPE's business online,
which will signal an end to the IPE's traditional open outcry pit trading.

""I don't know when we're going to do it (the transition from pit trading to
electronic trading),"" Ward said. ""We need to do it with the support of our
members. We have no timetable at all.""

GROWTH AFTER ENRON'S DEMISE

Owned by 100 of the world's largest energy and metals traders, brokers and
bankers, ICE started web-based OTC trading in November 2000.

While a majority of online energy exchanges faltered, ICE managed to pick up
speed and had already become a front runner in the field when its biggest
competitor suddenly folded.

ICE Chief Executive Jeff Sprecher hailed his company's stroke of luck, as
electronic trading trailblazer EnronOnline got out of ICE's way just as the
Atlanta exchange was approaching critical mass.

""We were just a tree in the forest, and then the forest burned down,"" Sprecher
said.

From hosting 2,500 trades totaling $2 billion a day in September, ICE now
boasts an average of $4 billion a day and 4,600 trades, exceeding
EnronOnline's average of about $3.5 billion during its heyday.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

As per my email from yesterday;
 
Attached are Pipeline companies, Transmission Company (Ercot) and Canadian companies not on the prior ""Louise Approved"" list which credit has been working on.
 
We have been having difficulty tracking down the full legal name for some of the storage and transmission companies, and for AEC storage, there are two names - I assume only one may be required. For any cases where the full legal name cannot be found today, we have included the group name. We will resolve the remaining full legal names on Monday morning, when other staff are available.

"Goldman Sachs Software Weekly for Week of January 28, 2002 (B)","THE WEEK IN REVIEW
Earnings reports galore; tone generally still cautious.
Software had a choppy week of trading with the movement in stocks driven for
the most in part by earnings releases. The Goldman Sachs Software Index
(GSO) finished the week up 5 pts or 2.7% to 189. The broader markets
finished the week up fractionally as well with the Nasdaq up 0.4% and the
Dow closed up 0.7%. Due to the shortened workweek, there was a plethora of
earnings announcements each night.

In general the results were slightly ahead of published estimates. With a
few exceptions (which we will get to) the tone of the conference calls was
upbeat but still somewhat cautious on the near term outlook. The March
quarter is still hazy as far as the demand environment, but we get the sense
that most companies were able to build a small amount of backlog heading
into the quarter. Guidance was generally left the same as most companies
expect the normal seasonality to occur. Most of our models are calling for
flat to down sequential growth for March still.

There were a few companies that had exceptional December quarters and raised
guidance for the March quarter and the year. The two notable companies is
this regard were SEBL and MERQ, both on the GS Recommended List. Both
companies were very bullish on their conference calls and believe that
software spending is beginning to get back to more normalized levels. MERQ
is an important datapoint for the rest of software since they are the
leading tester of packaged applications. They stated that they saw demand
come in to test applications for SAP, PSFT, SEBL and ORCL. SAP and PSFT also
reported strong quarters this week but were more conservative on their
respective economic outlooks. ORCL is hosting its Analyst Meeting in Redwood
Shores on Wednesday January 30, so we should get an update on their
application business at that time.

KEY DISCUSSION POINTS
1) Thoughts on competition and supply chain in general
There has been a lot of discussion and controversy surrounding market share
and competitive wins regarding the supply chain market and the three major
vendors (ITWO, MANU and SAP). The best gauge we have for looking at market
share is license revenue comparisons for the last few quarters.

Comparing ITWO and MANU's (we'll get to SAP later) license revenues for the
last four quarters, it would seem as if ITWO had lost share in June but has
taken a small amount of share from MANU (ITWO's share has gone from 70% to
77%) since. However, to give MANU credit they have not had the effect of
December in their reported results and we are projecting license revenues to
be up 15% in February while we believe that ITWO's license revenues will be
down 5%. If our estimates become reality then ITWO would be back to 70%
share with MANU at 30%.

What this exercise basically showed us is that neither company is taking
share from one another in the overall supply chain space in the last year.
In fact we believe that there is less overlap between the companies in the
marketplace than most investors believe. ITWO still is discrete
manufacturing focused, but has won deals in MANU's backyard of CPG of late.
On the flip side, MANU has better vertical diversification with a focus on
transportation management and has won deals of late in high tech. What we do
believe is that when demand for supply chain software returns both companies
should rebound. However, given its vertical focus, we would argue that ITWO
has more upside potential if high tech and industrial rebound more quickly
than other vertical areas.

SAP, unlike the two other vendors breaks out supply chain revenues by
customer intent. Given that they can sell a bundled suite of ERP, SCM (what
they call APO) and CRM solutions it is very difficult to tell what is
actually being used for supply chain. Our checks with the SI community
reveal that most of what SAP is selling as SCM is some basic demand and
material planning solutions. Also, we have not been able to find many
instances where SAP has beaten either ITWO or MANU head-to-head. Bottom line
is, despite SAP's claims earlier in the week, they are not dominating the
supply chain market.

2) Updated Fundamental Scorecard for the Supplier Relationship Mgt market
Now that we have had a chance to digest the earnings of all the SRM
companies under coverage, we have put together a scorecard to help investors
differentiate the companies by four main areas: Financial Performance,
Product Positioning, Organizational Strength and Industry Dynamics. Here are
a few high level thoughts on the sector in general.

	*Cost structures are improving - all the vendors with the exception
of CMRC did a good job of taking major steps at re-aligning their cost
structures. While S&M as a percentage of license revenues remains very high
compared to historical levels the companies were able to lower this ratio
dramatically in the quarter.

	*Balance sheets also improved - in general DSOs were down from
September due to better linearity (due to in part spillover) and a healthier
demand environment. Deferred revenues for the most part stabilized if not
ticked up and cash burn rates have slowed.

	*New products are important for 2002 growth - all the vendors are
hoping that new products will be able to spark growth in the next 4 quarters
both with new customers and with the current installed base. Innovation is
important and the companies have been more reluctant to cut R&D than other
areas of the firm.

".Org Shake-Up, The Urly Indicator for February, 01.02","
	Issue 104		
Urly Inidcator	Friday, 2.01.02	Afternic.com 	


		Dear Afternic Member ,   Will your .org names be affected by the upcoming registry shift?   No doubt you know that the VeriSign registry agreed to divest itself of the .org domain as part of VeriSign's deal to retain both its registry and registrar business units.  That means that a new registry will be running .org by this time next year.  But the divestiture's impact on .org registrants remains uncertain.   Rumors have suggested that .org will be reserved exclusively for nonprofits or officially recognized noncommercial organizations, that other .org registrants will lose their names or their ability to transfer or renew them.  Others have suggested that these rules will apply only to new registrations, grandfathering those existing before the new registry takes over.   The ICANN names council weighed in earlier this month with recommendations against evictions, transfer restrictions, and registration restrictions by the future .org registry, but neither ICANN nor registry applicants are obligated to accept these recommendations.  One that looks likely to win acceptance, though, is the suggestion that the new registry strive above all to differentiate .org from other gTLDs.   This is good news. Regardless of what happens to the 2.5 million currently registered .org names, any effort to establish a stronger identity or brand for .org will enhance the value of .org names.  If no registration restrictions accompany the registry transfer, .org will play a far more significant role in the aftermarket.

I just wanted to say thanks to all of you for your hard work in getting the documentation to the stage it is at today.  I know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward.  Unfortunately I do not see things getting much easier during our start-up months but I really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun along the way.

The commercial team was extremely pleased to receive the documentation and has set off to deliver them to our new customers.

Thanks for your late and long hours.

Louise

"Excambria Ships Margin Maker v2.0, Ramps Sales","
Dear Louise:
 
I thought you would find this interesting -- recent press release concerning Excambria's Margin Maker v2.0 product lineup. 
 
There is a good deal of new product information at www.excambria.com. 
 
Best regards,

Excambria Ships Margin Maker v2.0 Travel Distribution & Profitability Product Suite
 
Integrates Internet, GDS on Travel Professional's Desktop, Cuts Distribution Costs for Suppliers
 
San Mateo, CA(January 4, 2002). Excambria, Inc., the leading provider of applications to integrate legacy and Internet systems for the travel industry, today announced the availability of Margin Maker v2.0, the industry's new distribution and profitability product suite.
The patent-pending Margin Maker v2.0 family of products allows travel agents and corporate travel buyers to simultaneously access content through the legacy global distribution systems (GDS) such as Sabre and through the Internet, where travel suppliers are increasingly putting content that is not in the GDS. While the travel professional continues to work in his native GDS environment, Margin Maker v2.0 technology translates the GDS commands into Internet protocol and searches websites and other TCP/IP-connected data sources. The technology allows the travel professional to view on a single screen, with a single GDS command, content from the GDS, the Internet, and third-party databases. The inventory and fares are displayed side by side on a single screen, allowing travel professionals to select the inventory and price that create the maximum value for their clients and themselves. 
""Travel professionals were constantly being blindsided by customers who had seen cheap fares on the Web,"" said Excambria CEO Vajid Jafri. ""The travel professionals' work environment is GDS-centric, and workflow is so tightly bound to their legacy global distribution system that inventory available on the Internet remained largely inaccessible to them.""
Margin Maker v2.0 products solve this problem by seamlessly integrating Internet inventory and resulting transactions into agency and corporate travel workflow, with no additional commands or separate searches required by users.
Travel agency owners report that a solution such as Margin Maker v2.0 had been the highest priority request from their reservation agents during the last twelve months. Yet GDSs are not eager to field such a technology, fearing it will divert transactions from their own systems. 
Travel suppliers have welcomed Margin Maker v2.0 products, as a way to place their products onto the travel professional's desktop without high GDS distribution costs. An estimated 80% of all travel sales occur on these desktops.
Supports New Merchant Model
Travel agency owners also appreciate Margin Maker v2.0 features that allow them to seamlessly mark up low-cost Internet and net-basis fares. ""Many of the fares are so low that our agents can add a $400 mark-up at time of sale, and it's not visible to the customer,"" said one agency owner who has used Margin Maker v2.0 in pre-release. ""We continue to add our regular $20 service fee separately, but the real money is in those margins that we add. This technology allowed us to make the transition to merchant, and not a commissioned agent.""
Availability, Pricing and Service
Margin Maker v2.0 Agency Profitability Tool is available now through Excambria's network of nationwide resellers, as well as direct from the company, on a five-year license basis. 
Excambria offers a comprehensive range of service and support for the Margin Maker v2.0 product line, including on-site field service within the United Statesand lifetime telephone technical support. Premium field service upgrades available for Margin Maker v2.0 Agency Profitability Tool include extended service contracts and installation. 
Excambria also offers a range of servers preconfigured for Margin Maker v2.0 use, with pre-loaded proprietary software and hardware that install in minutes with no network downtime. These rack-mountable, GDS plug-and-play systems are designed for travel agencies and corporations of any size. 
About Margin Maker v2.0 Product Suite
Excambria's Margin Maker v2.0 family of products is a distribution and profitability suite that offers high ROI and immediate benefits to travel agencies, corporations and travel suppliers. Products include:
Margin Maker v2.0 Agency Profitability Tool 
Margin Maker v2.0 for the Corporate Travel Manager 
Margin Maker v2.0 Enterprise Suite 
Margin Maker Narrowband Channel Distribution Suite 

Excambria is the leading provider of integrated legacy system and Internet travel inventory sales applications used by some of the most successful travel suppliers and professionals to raise profits, cut costs and increase customer satisfaction. 
Excambria products are based on Excambria's state-of-the-art, patent-pending technology and platform-neutral approach that supports all global distribution systems, CRSs and back-office accounting and management systems. 
About Excambria, Inc.
Excambria is the leading provider of patent-pending software that integrates legacy systems with Internet content from a wide range of sources, on a single screen and with a single entry into the legacy system. In most large industries workflow, reporting and management tools have evolved from and are driven by the industry's legacy systems -- yet more and more critical information is appearing on the Internet, outside the reach of these legacy systems.
As a first step, the company is establishing its presence in the travel industry. Excambria's proprietary technology, Margin Maker v2.0, provides travel professionals a split screen that allows them to compare Internet and net-basis fares side by side with retail fares from their Sabre or other legacy system, in a single window. Both corporate travel purchasers and travel agents give the product rave reviews. The company can be found on the Web at http://www.excambria.com.

Louise, 

The following  employees currently working on the floor but have not received offers from UBS and are still on the estate payroll

Amy Shewster (sp?)-receptionist.  She is needed not only to direct and answer calls but for security purposes.
Jessie Villareal-clerk/runner.  Jessie is the only clerk on the floor and is apparently filling a very vital role.  T Jae Black (power), Ina Rangel (gas) and Liz all agree that we need him long term.  

We have two options:
1.  Leave them on estate payroll and ask for them to be seconded to UBS for a period of time
2.  Give them UBS offers-I would need to do this tomorrow morning in order to get in before deal close.

Let me know what you would like to do.  Thanks much.

2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

Just a quick update on what I've been doing since leaving HoustonStreet.

Press Release
SOURCE: Ashton Technology Group, Inc.
The Ashton Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiary of OptiMark Holdings, Inc.
Announce Strategic Investment and Bridge Financing
OptiMark Innovations Inc. to Provide Ashton With $30 Million in Intellectual
Property and Operating Capital; Other Parties Provide $500,000 Bridge
Financing
PHILADELPHIA & JERSEY CITY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 5, 2002-- The Ashton
Technology Group, Inc. (BB: ASTN.OB) and OptiMark Innovations Inc., a
corporation owned by affiliates of SOFTBANK Capital Partners and OptiMark,
Inc. (OptiMark), a wholly owned subsidiary of OptiMark Holdings, Inc.,
announced today the signing of a definitive agreement representing a
strategic investment in Ashton.
Additionally, Ashton announced that HK Weaver Group Limited has agreed to
provide Ashton with up to $500,000 in bridge financing.
As part of the agreement with Ashton, upon closing, OptiMark Innovations
will provide Ashton with assets valued at $30 million, including $10 million
in cash, as well as intellectual property, licenses and management
expertise. In return, OptiMark Innovations will own at least 80% of the
outstanding shares of Ashton. Closing of the transaction is contingent upon,
among other things, shareholder approval to increase the number of Ashton's
authorized shares, completion of certain creditor negotiations, closing of a
private equity investment in OptiMark Innovations and installation of a new
Board of Directors commensurate with OptiMark Innovation's ownership stake
in Ashton.
Upon closing of the strategic investment, Ashton will, through broker-dealer
subsidiaries, offer a unique service for sell-side firms acting as agents,
to offer cost-effective guaranteed Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
orders to their clients. To provide these guaranteed VWAP orders, Ashton
will become a principal trading firm using state-of-the-art electronic
trading algorithms that over the past five years have demonstrated the
viability of this approach by achieving returns approximating VWAP. Ashton
will continue to operate its eVWAP
 facility for orders submitted
anonymously from buy-side institutions.
Upon the closing of the transaction, Robert Warshaw, OptiMark's Chief
Executive, will become interim CEO of Ashton, replacing Fred Rittereiser.
Trevor Price, OptiMark's Executive Vice President for Product Strategy and
Marketing, will become Ashton's Chief Operating Officer. James Pak,
OptiMark's Executive Vice President for Strategic Development, will become
Ashton's Chief Financial Officer. Fred Weingard, Ashton's Chief Technology
Officer, will retain that position and his board seat. Additionally, William
Uchimoto will continue as Ashton General Counsel and a member of the
executive management team. Jennifer Andrews will keep her current
responsibilities and will assume the title of Executive Vice President,
Finance.
Mr. Warshaw said, ``Ashton, under Fred Rittereiser's visionary leadership
and innovation, has laid the foundation for what we believe can become a
highly profitable business. We bring, in addition to needed operating
capital, the critical ability as principal traders, to provide liquidity and
guaranteed fills for VWAP orders for the sell-side firms.'' Mr. Warshaw
added that Mr. Rittereiser would serve as a special advisor to the Board of
Directors
Mr. Rittereiser said, ``OptiMark Innovation's intellectual property,
technical support, operating capital and strong Wall Street relationships
were key ingredients in the strategic partnership. The combination will
create a stronger, well-capitalized firm which will accelerate the
implementation of a new competitive business model.''
New Ashton Management Team
As part of the strategic relationship, OptiMark professionals will work with
Ashton to facilitate implementation of the technology, expedite the launch
of Ashton's new business and oversee the steps that the combined management
believes are necessary to make the company profitable.

University's Kellogg School of Management.

patents. Prior to Optimark, Mr. Price was Chairman, CEO and Founder of
SavvyJack, Inc., a business-to-business e-commerce application services
provider that enabled companies to market and sell their intellectual
capital. While at SavvyJack, Mr. Price was responsible for overall corporate
strategy, financing, strategic business development and sales. Prior to

sales and product development. Pagoda was spun-out of Software Services
International, Inc., a global services capital firm with over 400 employees,
where Mr. Price held numerous operational and management positions. Mr.

USA:
Commodity exchanges NYMEX, ICE in alliance talks-source.

02/05/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and
web-based IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) have reopened talks aimed at an
alliance between the two commodity exchanges, a source close to the
negotiations said.

""There have been a number of meetings over the last 2-3 weeks aimed at some
sort of closer business association. They may not come to anything but it's
fair to say that conversations are going on,"" the source said.
NYMEX is the world's leading physical commodity exchange, but at ICE, which is
backed by top oil and power companies, business has boomed since the demise of
previous internet leader EnronOnline.

ICE, which trades a range of energy and metals contracts, has already taken
over London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE). Prior to the IPE/ICE
merger NYMEX and ICE held alliance talks that came to nothing.

A NYMEX spokeswoman declined comment but said the exchange was always
interested in considering potential strategic alliances.

NYMEX has had to shelve its planned web exchange enymex and also operated on
shortened trading hours since the Sept 11. attacks on the nearby World Trade
Center. NYMEX seats have been trading at sharply higher prices in recent weeks.

Michelle,  Correct me on this one if I am wrong...

In the body of the email distributed yesterday afternoon it says that the form should be sent to Linda Guinn.  I believe she is in the legal department for Enron.  So I would assume she is the person who will track and report on who has and has not submitted their certification letter.

OK

Who is the individual responsible for making sure that 600 plus people will read the 9 pages of protocol and will also verify and collect a signed certification from every new UBS employee by this Friday?  Who will collect Enron's copy of these and hold them and is someone coordinating with UBS directly?

To:		All Enron Employees Transferring to UBS Warburg Energy (or its affiliates)

Under the terms of the various agreements among certain Enron entities and UBS AG, certain Enron data and documents may be provided to UBS.

Please review the protocol carefully.  Then, complete the attached Certification and return it, with attachments, to Linda Guinn at EB 3829a no later than February 11, 2002.

Questions about this matter may be directed to Michelle Cash at (713) 853-6401 or Francisco Pinto-Leite at (713) 345-7942 .

Louise, I talked in detail with Caroline this am. We need to identify where Caroline is going to reside. I understand that UBS has two operations in NY - I think you and Hutchins need to decide what makes the most sense (ie synergies). It is critical that we get this resolved so that Caroline has some infrastructure around her.

"2001 In The Rearview,  The Urly Indicator for December 28.01","
	Issue 99		
Urly Inidcator	Friday, 12.28.01	Afternic.com 	


		Dear Afternic Member ,  Ought-one is nearly done.   It leaves in its wake perhaps the most tempestuous 12 months in domain name history. Absent the streaking Internet market, domain investors' strategies were tested. Collections of traffic-catchers, properties developed as proof-of-concept sites, and portfolios of single names and logical sets vied for buyers' attention. Some sellers culled their holdings, releasing names they were unable to sell. Others swooped in to grab them, and in some cases enjoyed more success than their predecessors.   Gauging the domain name game by sales activity on Afternic, the second and fourth quarters showed unprecedented strength, suggesting that 2001 far outclassed previous years in aftermarket transaction volume. But for those domain investors that identified and thrived on reliable market patterns, this year threw a serious wrench into the works: new TLDs.   The namespace changed more radically than some realized when .biz and .info entered the root. Initial assessments of new gTLDs' crashing success and failure are laughably premature especially considering many of the most valuable .biz names haven't been released. It may be years before their true impact is felt on the 'net and their true value is reflected in the aftermarket. But if netizens begin to recognize meaning in the string at the right of the dot, the current valuation logic will soon become obsolete.   In one way or another, the namespace will undergo massive change in 2002, but as always the aftermarket will provide the first indications of it.

You may want to send a note to your commercial team to channel all new customer requests through Dave Forster and me.  I would like to be copied to make sure Dave has a clue as to what are real priorities.  Once we get up and running and the volume drops, I would be happy to coordinate this effort.
