"RE: More Portland Issues","I have asked Jeff Golden and Don Miller.  Don is leaning towards giving UBS a purchase option at fair market value.  Though I haven't heard from Jeff, he could decide to ""give"" UBS the FF&E now, but he'd probably need to trade it for something else he wants.

Subject: More Portland Issues


It was just brought to my attention by Dave Steiner that the Estate will continue to own the F(urniture), F(ixtures), and E(quipment) and that UBS will be able to use it for free so long as we are in this building.

As you both know, it is possible that we will move from this floor and would like to take a good portion of the FFE with us.  My understanding is that Enron is leasing the furniture in Houston and owns the furniture in Portland.  Therefore, it makes sense for the Houston office to continue to use the furniture but not move it.  It doesn't make as much sense here as it will be expensive for the Estate to dispose of the furniture here and it will be even more expensive to move it to sell it.

Here's the issue -- the Estate should convey the furniture in Portland to UBS.  Is this possible?  What do we need to do to make this happen?

"RE: Please help"," Just to add to Peter's comments - the fundamental premise of the UBS transaction would be the backing of the double A+ balance sheet as the contracting party. To think that counterparties will accept a parental guarantee is unrealistic.

To clarify:

1.  The guarantee issue is already in play with the Canadian pipelines, power pools, office landlords, etc. and will be an impediment to closing and/or commencing business operations;

2.  It is not that counterparties will be unlikely to transact with this new UBSW Canadian entity without credit support ... they will not;

3.  Although parental g'ee of UBS AG as credit support will help, the structure of a non-creditworthy sub supported by a parental g'ee (with its own terms, conditions and limits) is the old Enron structure, and it may well not be well received in the industry.

Canada appears to be an issue.

We need to make swift progress on this - unlike in the US the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be UBS AG, London Division but UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.  With the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from UBS, this is going to be an issue.

There are two main points, because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers.

Please let me know how we can progress on this.

- actual moving and related costs 
- sales commission on house
- a couple of moving trips
- temp housing for a month or two
- coverage on appraised value of house if can not sell quickly
- gross up to cover taxes, where appropriate

- Not looking to gain, just to remain whole

Louise --

I need to understand exactly what data is and what data is not being transferred from Enron to UBS.  If any of the data is viewed by FERC as being jurisdictional assets, than Enron would need to inform FERC of that transfer before the transfer.  Clearly, customer specific data will create more issues than generic market information.  I need to check what happens if you have deleted the counterparty names but still show detailed trading data.
 
Who can help me get a better handle on this on Monday?
 
Also, I understand the ""adoption"" by UBS of Enron contracts.  Initially I was under the impression that this was simply a ""review"".  Again, any transfer of a jurisdictional asset would result in a 203 application by Enron.  I have seen one draft of the Interim Agreement, but assume that you would do this for EEI and other physical contracts.  Am I right?
 
Thanks,
 
Jim

"RE: Longview DASH Request","Louise,

Cancellation charges have been the focus because the cash is provided by e-Next banks (turbopark).  The cash paid to date is less than the actual contractual obligation to date.  We do not need balance sheet cash to continue, but we need to come up with B/S cash if we terminate.  Hopefully the following clarifies:

Cash Payments to Date: 
GE7FA		13,328
ST		909
HRSG		1480
Interest 	350
Total:		16,067

Next Payments:
GE7FA		1,566		Nov 21
ST		2,849		Dec 1
HRSG		2,960		Dec 1
These are estimates - the timing of the actual payments depends upon when the vendor completes some of the work - payment based on milestones

Cancellation Charges:
10/31:		$23MM
11/1:		$24MM
11/30:		$28.3MM
Each day from 11/1 to 11/30 the cancellation charge increases by approx $150K 
   
DASH is based on contractual exposure, not cash out the door, hence the request at this time.  In addition to looking for opportunities to sell the equipment and the project, we are looking into the ST and HRSG contracts to make sure the vendors are not in any sort of breach.

Louise:

A termination of equipment associated with the Longview project on or before 10/31/01 will require Enron to write-off approximately $23 million, not inclusive of approximately $3 million in development costs to date.
To extend orders for equipment to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million in cancellation charges.
To extend orders for equipment to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 million (inclusive of the $5.3 million above, therefore, net $3.4 million) in cancellation charges.

Termination at any time between now and year-end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent.

The name for the Canadian entity which will enter into both Master Agreements and individual commodity transactions is: ""UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd."", as confirmed by Lou Eber: UBS Chief Legal Counsel.

I am working on chasing down the parental guarantee issue.

"ECC New Grads","David, we made offers to 4 new grads a few months ago to work for Enron Canada Corp. ECC is obviously going to renege on these offers. Is there any opportunity to have these offers assigned to UBS Warburg Energy. All four of these new grads are outstanding and the timing should be aligned with business ramping up (ie June - Sept timeframe). The estate would be cooperative with assigning the offers and the students are looking for clarity/comfort.

"","Attached is a simple power origination case study that I have developed for use at MBA functions as an alternative to a generic one-hour presentation about Enron.  It will be used for the first time at Georgetown tomorrow.  I thought this tool, or a derivative thereof, could also be useful in early identification of potential ""Origination Track"" Associates from the Associate pool, as it covers issues related to project development, risk analysis, financial evaluation and debt financing.

I would be happy to think together with you on changes to the case that would enhance its value to the Origination Track program.

"Leveraging UBS' financial services","Chris/Louise
 
While our obvious near-term priority should be to execute trading agreements with key CPs and jumpstart our trading, it seems to me another high priority should be to try to leverage UBS' investment banking/lending relationships to uncover incremental, near-term origination opportunities.  Given the many financial challenges facing the sector, in particular the merchant generation sector (sinking share prices, capital squeeze, shoring of balance sheets, etc.), I think there are probably some interesting value plays we could tap into combining our commodity skills with the financial services of UBS Warburg.  You've probably already covered this, but I was thinking that a strategy meeting in the near future with some of their folks in Stamford would make sense in order to assess what low-hanging fruit there might be within their investment banking/lending relationships.  This might be a means for our origination group to deliver greater value to the bank than what we could otherwise be able to accomplish given the startup leadtime and internal risk constraints we will likely face.  I would be very interested in discussing this further with you.
 
Regards
John

"RE: UBS AG Market Based Rate Tariff Application","Filing looks good.  My vote is go forward with a clean 205 filing as attached.
 
If we file the 203 as well, FERC will gravitate directly toward that.   I think we retain more flexibility if we stick with the 205 approach.
 
Other thoughts?   I will be in Florida (vacation) Wednesday through Friday.    I can be reached via cell and TJ will have my hotel phone #.    In addition, I will check e-mails at least once per day at the hotel business center.

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)

"Proposed Retention Bonuses for Netco","Louise,
I am sorry to bother you at such a critical time, because I know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at Enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter. 
However, I felt like I had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following.
 
Dave Forster & I met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group. I was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual. I was allowed to move dollars but NOT allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group. Frankly, the numbers seemed pretty low. 
 
Assuming the goal is to retain key employees for Netco, I am not confident these numbers will achieve this. 
I know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company. I have asked them to be patient, not make any quick decisions, and give us a chance to see this through.
 
Dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations. As you know, mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end. The mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end. I understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available. However, because the retention numbers were based on this, they are significantly lower.
 
My intentions are not to show any disrepect to Dave by discussing this with you but I wanted to make sure my thoughts /opinions were communicated to you. If Dave has already discussed this with you, I apologize for the duplication. 
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me. I am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713-446-9669.
 
Thank you for your time.
Jennifer

"New York","Louise, I talked in detail with Caroline this am. We need to identify where Caroline is going to reside. I understand that UBS has two operations in NY - I think you and Hutchins need to decide what makes the most sense (ie synergies). It is critical that we get this resolved so that Caroline has some infrastructure around her.

"More Portland Issues","It was just brought to my attention by Dave Steiner that the Estate will continue to own the F(urniture), F(ixtures), and E(quipment) and that UBS will be able to use it for free so long as we are in this building.

As you both know, it is possible that we will move from this floor and would like to take a good portion of the FFE with us.  My understanding is that Enron is leasing the furniture in Houston and owns the furniture in Portland.  Therefore, it makes sense for the Houston office to continue to use the furniture but not move it.  It doesn't make as much sense here as it will be expensive for the Estate to dispose of the furniture here and it will be even more expensive to move it to sell it.

Here's the issue -- the Estate should convey the furniture in Portland to UBS.  Is this possible?  What do we need to do to make this happen?

Did I miss something?  Did we ever talk about a presentation

Maybe I missed something or it went to the other Bob Hall.

"RE: remote offices","The New York 780 3rd Ave office is closed and has been inventoried. I am now working on the removal of the IT equipment. The 520 Madison office is leased under MG Metals and only a few ENA employees remain at that location. Chicago, Montreal and Toronto include some MG people and I am hoping to have some clarity on these locations early in the new year.

I appreciate your assistance

OK 

Please check with Don Miller too.  Netco does not want San Francisco going forward and probably not Chicago.

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.  

Calgary
Portland
San Francisco
Chicago
Denver

I have also been contacted by Paula Corey,  who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed.  I will keep you posted on the recommendations.

Regards,
Tammy

Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conversation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.  --Sally

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

I am a head hunter in London, and I specialise in the energy sector. Would
you be interested in returning to the UK to work for a company with ambition
and a strong balance sheet to support its intentions in online trading.

You would be an excellent choice of person to lead this effort.

"Re: Final Collateral Annexes"," - ARPA1.txt 
     I have no further comment, from UBS Legal standpoint, on either the
     one-way or two-way ISDA Credit Support Annex Paragraph 13, pending
     the text to come defining ""Material Adverse Change"".

     Will have comments on the Gas Annex tomorrow and the Power Annex as
     soon as possible after I receive it.

     I will be in Stamford tomorrow at 203.719.8958.

Louise

Have been thinking about you over the past few weeks and hope that you and
Marcus are OK.

I missed the last posting date to the States by weeks so am sending you an
e:Christmas message.    Hope you all have a great time - having a little one
makes a big difference to Christmas - Milly is so excited, but we are even more
excited about seeing her face when she opens her pressies and sees that Santa
has eaten his mince pie!!

Would be really good to see you in the New Year - all the best for 2002.

Love from Ches, Media Star and Milly Moo

"YOU HAVE 48 HOURS","This is not a circular and you will not get another chance.  This deals with migration to new systems and you need to migrate your own information or applications in the next day.  Remember do not delete anything and data to be transferred must comply (see attachments below).

The policy must be complied by Thursday.  Please ensure that everyone in your group has moved everything which is in compliance with the policy.  We will not be delaying close or restart for people not having completed their own migrations.

Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply (eg Dana - please cover Kevin's migration requirements)

"RE: IT & Back Office Service Agreements","Just to clarify the Canadian situation, we will not be able to assign the MSA's to NETCO without the customer's approval.  To date, this has not occurred.

Subject:	IT & Back Office Service Agreements

Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office Services to several parties.  Beth has expressed some concerns about the estate's ability to be able to support  a production trading environment once a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate.  Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these services agreements.  Here are some suggestions:

Peggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Services agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.

Bridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has no way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enron for everything from email, internet, network services and office applications as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are concerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in Enron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.

AEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastructure in place and currently provide for their own email and office support services.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA system and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our Pipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications into their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal was to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and suggest that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information from one system to another until they have put in their own integration between the applications listed above.

Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put together a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.

The AEP and Bridgeline deals must be investigated.  There is no way the estate can support a production environment.  I will be reviewing the contracts to determine our obligations and possible alternatives.

Subject:	Integration Test Planning / Coordination Mtg Summary



Key Planning Assumptions
1) Jan 20 go live
2) New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by Jan 15. This assumes all major production data setup - users, rights, books, global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis. Some code changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ensure the applications still talk to each other. 
3) Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactions from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that applications and interfaces still work. We will not be testing functional permutations, data conditions, validation or exceptions to any significant degree. 
4) Each application conversion team must test their changes before approving their changes for integration testing. We are operating from the premise that data, infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a application system level before the enterprise integration test starts. 
4) All systems will be physically split (even Unify at this point). 
5) Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Estate and New Co. 
6) We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and execution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production. 
7) We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conversion and test team purposes. There are two teams - Conversion and Integration Test. Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co. Resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility. 
8) Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co conversion work can begin in earnest. Estate conversion is on the critical path for New Co. 


Key Issues
1) We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial trading first, then physical. If financial is the focus, delivery risk goes down dramatically. For now, we must plan on the worst case -- physical and financial on Jan 20. 
2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support AEP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we're in synch. 
3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single license of Unify. 
4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for counterparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks. 
5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one trading. 
6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline considerations. The time window will be very small. 


Core Conversion Team  
1) Steve Stock - Applications
2) Bob McAuliffe - Infrastructure
3) Ziyong Wei
4) Steve Nat
5) Dave Nommensen
6) Ken Harmon
7) John Warner
8) Bob Ward
....

Core Integration Test Team 
1) Jeff Johnson
2) Iain Greig
3) Aftab Saleem
4) Terry Sanvido
5) Regan Smith

Program Coordination 
1) Jane Henry
2) Steve Simpson

Next Steps For Integration Test Team

3) Due 12/20. Identify list of core systems for test purposes. Identify key IT owner and key business owner and respresentative for integration test. Owner: Iain Greig. 
4) Due 12/21. Define integration test workplan for integration test planning and execution for both Estate and New Co. Owner: Jeff Johnson
5) Ongoing. Participation in daily program management coordination meeting at 8:30. Owners: Jeff Johnson, Iain Greig, Aftab Saleem. 
6) Due 12/21. Organize meeting with key users and IT contacts to communciate foundation assumptions, context, team and approach for integration test. Develop first cut at sample trade transaction set. Owner: Iain Greig / Aftab Saleem. 
7) Completed. Contact Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Bob Superty, Brice Baxter to communicate above and set up meeting to begin planning with them on the integration testing process. Owner: Jeff Johnson
8) Due 12/21.  Refine core system list with IT owners and Business owners for integration test purposes. Owner: Iain Greig. 
9) Due 12/20. Set up Integration Test folder on O drive under Infotech / Development Support.  Owner: Aftab Saleem. 

Let me know if you have questions or changes. I am out tomorrow but I'm back on Friday. 

Thanks.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

"Content","Louise,

Since our conversation today, I have discovered that by terminating the Reuters contract, we will lose the entire Headline News category, as well as the Stock Quotes, Sports News and Weather News.

Reuters costs over $80,000 per month. This pushes the cost of content for NewCo to over $360,000 for relatively little benefit.

Therefore, contrary to what we agreed earlier, I would like to drop all of the content on the right side of the quotes screen. We will adjust screen size or insert graphics accordingly to get things looking right until our Phase 3 expansion.

Please advise if you agree.

Dave

Dear Louise,

I hope everything is well at your end.

Given the fact that UBS seems be the buyer of the Enron trading part in the US I was wondering if you think it is worthwhile to think about (or discuss) an extension to Europe (or the Netherlands in particular).

I am currently still employed by Enron although we are currently in the process of closing down the Enron Amsterdam office (I therefore attached my private contact details).

"RE: Power Documents (Final)","The last I heard was that you wanted legal to prepare a physical power GTC which was similar to what we had online before and Leslie Hansen was trying to convince you otherwise.

The supplied document is nine pages of elections and amendments to the EEI. The EEI itself is not included.

The blank lines in the elections sheets are, I am told, optional, and are included in order to give a true representation of the standard elections sheet to the EEI. Obviously, when displayed online, these blank lines cannot be filled in.

I don't think I do  - I thought Elizabeth said she would use a reference document - not the EEI.

Louise,

Did you ultimately agree with legal that we would proceed with using the EEI as the GTC?

The GTC provided below is the EEI.

Attached are final forms of certain Power Trading documents:

1.  Master Agreement EEI (full blown), with all credit terms left blank, for negotiation with counterparties (CP);

2.  EEI Collateral Annex, including paragraph 10, for use with the Master Agreement EEI;

3.  GTC EEI, Online with credit terms (unilateral right to call for collateral at any time for any reason), for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade);

4.  GTC EEI, Online without  credit terms, for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will not be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade).

While these documents have been discussed generally with UBS, UBS has not yet had an opportunity to review the actual final version.

100 copies of the first two documents (which will be combined as one for distribution) will be delivered by Genia to Dave shortly.

Please call with any questions/comments.

"RE: Proposed Retention Bonuses for Netco","I've been spending a fair bit of time sitting with the troops, sharing information with them, getting a sense of the mood and basically just trying to be visible, accessible and supportive. I think for the most part, people are trying to give us time for things to settle out, while trying also to ensure they have an escape route in case things go pear-shaped.
 
Kal and Heather were both out last Friday and will be out until Wednesday, so we have not done anything yet to modify the designs. I did send them both an email on the subject, though, so we should be on the case on Wednesday. 
 
Christmas was great - thanks for asking. We had a quiet Christmas with just the two of us. I repainted the helicopter (have pictures, if you're interested).
 
Have you been having a good visit with your Mom and Dad? Hopefully you've been able to put this place out of your mind when you go home. . .

Jennifer doesn't know it yet, but when I submitted final numbers to HR, I kept her suggested increases and did not apply her suggested decreases (which she did to balance the increases).
 
I expect we are going to lose some people. I hope the ones that go are not the best ones. Obviously, the more we are willing to spend in bonus, the fewer the people we will lose. 
 
When would you like to get together to discuss?

Louise,
I am sorry to bother you at such a critical time, because I know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at Enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter. 
However, I felt like I had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following.
 
Dave Forster & I met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group. I was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual. I was allowed to move dollars but NOT allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group. Frankly, the numbers seemed pretty low. 
 
Assuming the goal is to retain key employees for Netco, I am not confident these numbers will achieve this. 
I know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company. I have asked them to be patient, not make any quick decisions, and give us a chance to see this through.
 
Dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations. As you know, mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end. The mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end. I understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available. However, because the retention numbers were based on this, they are significantly lower.
 
My intentions are not to show any disrepect to Dave by discussing this with you but I wanted to make sure my thoughts /opinions were communicated to you. If Dave has already discussed this with you, I apologize for the duplication. 
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me. I am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713-446-9669.
 
Thank you for your time.
Jennifer

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Subject:	Terminated Employees' Benefits

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good friends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get updates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do whatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more about the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their way right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, not even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these benefits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated (or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck coming in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, no medical benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets do something to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ employees status changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish this.  Whomever is in charge of getting this done, are we sure they have a sense of urgency about the situation?  People could lose their homes, cars, etc. while they are waiting on all this red tape....this is very important.

Please advise.

If you guys are still looking for originators, you should put a call into Rodney Malcolm 3-4746.  He is very strong, and most likely available with the demise of DaveCo.

OK - here's the sort of thing I am thinking of (still needs Kal's magic).

I suspect you were thinking of a pop-up notice. Given that we aren't really showing anything on EnronOnline at the moment, I suggest we take down EnronOnline entirely and replace it with a splash page which says something like the following:


					COMING SOON

Enron is working with potential industry partners to assemble a new venture which will combine Enron's trading and market - making expertise with the financial strength and reliability of an A rated entity.

Upon formation of this new company, we anticipate that we will be able to announce the launch of a new trading platform for North American gas and power, providing services similar to those previously available on EnronOnline.

Please check back with this site for future updates on plans for the new trading platform.




What do you think?

"Various Canadian Matters","Further to our call this morning, I want to outline the attached list of outstanding matters respecting the Canadian business, which may not be exhaustive.  

Further, at the outset and to manage expectations, I want to emphasize that the preparation of the Canadian business for commercial start-up needs to be considered within the framework of human resource constraints, attending to finalization of acquisition agreements and arrangements with Enron Canada for the acquisition of the Canadian business interest, and as yet unclear understanding with respect to various matters of detail that are required with respect to the commencement of the Canadian business within UBSW.  At the same time, I understand that there is an extraordinary amount of work that needs to be done to address the U.S. side of the North American power business and that the detail required to be considered with respect to the Canadian gas and power business may have to take a back seat to those matters for the time being.  

With that, the following is my list of issues that need to be considered:

1.	Trading Forms:

	(a)	Gas GTC - I have circulated my blackline comments to the form prepared in Houston, noting certain of my comments are jurisdictional to Canada but others are generic to the form in general.  The blackline is attached:

	 
	
	(b)	Financial GTC - Again, I have circulated my blackline comments to the form prepared in Houston, noting certain of my comments are jurisdictional to Canada and others are more generic to the form in general.  The blackline is attached:

	 

	(c)	Power GTC - I have not yet had the opportunity to review or consider the proposed forms prepared in Houston; and

	(d)	Master Agreements (gas, power and financial) -  I have not yet had the opportunity to review or consider the proposed forms prepared in Houston.  

Subject to the other matters referred to below, the priority for first trading in our market is finalizing the Gas GTC and the Financial GTC.

2.	Guarantees:  I attach a blacklined revision to the UBS AG form as revised by Carol, with my revisions reflecting comments to the form as commented on by Carol:

	 

Structurally, I have the following concerns:

	(a)	I believe we should consider a more flexible description of all potential gas, power and financial transactions in the recitals to the guarantee to facilitate a broadbased guarantee from the counterparty;

	(b)	I do not believe that the guarantee should be limited to an aggregate financial limit.  This requires credit monitoring, and in my experience can result in the risk of under-guaranteed amounts with the counterparty.  Further, where UBS AG has a direct covenant, it seems to me that there would be no corresponding limit on its exposure;

	(c)	I have other comments, some of which again are jurisdictional to Canada and others of which are more generic to the form in general;

	(d)	as I have mentioned, we need to have an approved form of guarantee to be provided from UBS AG in support of UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd. (""UBSWC""), which I assume will be in the same form merely reversed to be in favour of the trading counterparty.  We will also need to understand the specific internal process we must follow to obtain the UBS AG guarantee of UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.;

	(e)	where UBS AG is providing guarantee support for UBSWC, we expect that some market participants or institutions will require guarantee support in forms which are  different from UBS AG's customary guarantee form.  In other words, various market participants such as transportation providers (NOVA, TCPL, Westcoast, Foothills, ANG, etc.), transmission administrators (EAL, IMO), gas inventory administrators (NOVA), gas storage providers, exchange operators (Natural Gas Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, WattExchange), power pool administrators (PPoA, IMO), etc., some of which are regulated and others of which only deal on their own terms, may require guarantee support in their own forms.  Again, in these instances we will have to understand the specific internal process through which we can obtain the customized guarantee from UBS AG; and

	(f)	we need to resolve the mechanism for providing a UBS AG guarantee for online trades entered into prior to negotiating a fully guaranteed Master Agreement.

3.	Transaction Procedures:  With respect to UBSWC, we need to understand the following:

	(a)	for trading counterparties, we need a detailed understanding of the proposed execution, guarantee and daily novation procedures back to the London branch;

	(b)	who will be the authorized signing officers and what will be the execution procedures for UBSWC for GTCs, Masters, Confirms, etc.?;

	(c)	for non-trading/market participation counterparties (i.e., transportation providers, transmission administrators, gas inventory providers, gas storage providers, exchange operators, power pool administrators, etc.), are the same transaction procedures intended (i.e., is UBSWC the executing counterparty, guaranteed by UBS AG, and do the novation procedures back to the London branch apply?); 

	(d)	are the trading confirms being updated?; and

	(e)	is consideration being given to procedures whereby trading confirms can be eliminated (i.e., the volume of confirms for Enron Online had become somewhat overwhelming for the Operations Group and they have indicated to me that there are proposals to remove the need for trading confirms, at least for online transactions)?

4.	Regulatory/Market Participation:  

	(a)	I understand that Rob Hemstock has provided detailed documentation with respect to the permitting/market participation requirements and has partially drafted the required forms.  Finalizing most of these applications  requires some of the more detailed understandings I have referred to above;

	(b)	I have not been involved in the creation of UBSWC, which I understand has been done by Stikeman Elliott, but we need to ensure that it is corporately registered to carry on business as an extra-provincial corporation in all key jurisdictions (Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia); and

	(c)	We will require for various purposes, including obtaining regulatory and permitting approvals and authorizations, copies of the incorporation and organization documentation for UBSWC, including list of directors and officers;

	(d)	In some instances (e.g. NEB gas and power export permits) the Canadian permit will be held by UBS Warburg Energy Ltd. and therefore we need copies of the incorporation and organization documentation for UBS Warburg Energy Ltd.   We will also need to ensure UBS Warburg Energy Ltd. it is corporately registered to carry on business in Canada and that we are provided with Canadian organization documentation for UBS Warburg Energy Ltd. that we can use to satisfy the NEB of its corporate status.

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

"I need your help","
I still get 7-8 people every day whining about the ""trading vs marketing thing"".  Some of it is ridiculous but some of it could go away if we changed a few things.  Either we call every commercial person a trader or we periodically acknowledge the existence of marketers. I vote for the latter.  The employee presentation talked about ""trading and operations groups"", the online materials talked about ""trading staff and technology"", the ubs spokesperson today in the news article said ""625 traders and support people"", and said the traders are ""talking to customers about getting contracts in place"".  Tim's assistant tried to pull rank on my assistant because ""we are a trading company now""!! The invites for the credit and legal meetings were called ""trader meetings"".  The master agreement references the trading business.  NETCO.  In isolation, all of these things are trivial. Add it all up, we have a problem.  We lost some of our better marketers due to this issue - I don't want to lose more in 6 or 12 months.

This is not a ying-yang issue:. I am thrilled about this deal closing, but we need to fix this or else we will have a nonproductive group of expensive personnel.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

"Access Card Information","

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

"High Yield Portfolio Hedging","Louise

Hope alls well and you're enjoying life in Houston.  One of the projects my group (Enron Credit - Syndication), are currently working on is to try and originate, structure and place a High Yield and / or Emerging Market CDO, which is made up of both Enron risks and externally originated risks. The plan would be to provide a cost effective way for Enron to hedge its credit exposure to riskier counterparties.   I am not sure if Enron North America has any of this type of exposure, but would be interested to talk to someone and find out if there is any way that we might be able to help your group.   I attach a short presentation which outlines the rationale for what we are doing.

 

I am going to be in Houston the week of the 17th September and would appreciate a steer as to who would be the best person to speak to on this.

Regards, Robina

Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.

"Bonus and Options","Louise,

- It has come to my attention that some groups (back office) have been told that each individual within their group can elect to be part of the Estate or of NewCo. This is surprising to me. No such election has been offered to anyone in EnronOnline (nor do I think it would make sense to offer that), but before I tell people they do not have a choice, I wanted to check with you.  - ?

- On the issue of bonuses: The numbers we put together made sense to me in the context of an annual  bonus with some element of retention mixed in. According to the auctions documents I looked at, retention is identified as being for a 1 year period, with 1/2 of the amount paid up front and 1/2 one year later. If this is the case, it significantly changes the complexion (i.e. more like a retention payment with an element of bonus, rather than bonus with an element of retention) and we should revisit the numbers.

"FW: DASH Spending Controls Team Meeting","Louise,

We're making good progress with a new project expense management protocol that will provide Business Unit Executives with higher quality information on project expenditures as well as automatically require management authorization or re-authorization at pre-determined levels of spend or DASH approved limits.  My plan is to have this implemented by 1Q2002.

Richard Lauer from RAC is leading this effort.  I'll keep you posted on developments.

Let me know if you have any specific thoughts or requests on this.

To:	Vargas, Hope; Pierce, Jody; Hodges, Georganne; Schneider, Chip; Boehm, Rick; Musser, Paul; Dupre, David; Carson, Rick L.; Lowry, Donna; Stafford, Clayton
Subject:	DASH Spending Controls Team Meeting

This e-mail follows the October 18th ISC (SAP) working session and other one-on-one accounting process meetings.  Both working session and process meetings have been very productive.  In preparation of tomorrow's team meeting, Clayton Stafford has outlined several SAP Features and possible process enhancements as follows:

?	Opportunity may exist to create projects at the Project definition level in SAP.  This would enable aggregate charges to be summarized and actual compared to budget across multiple company codes.  Need to further understand the relationship between profit centers and project definition levels in SAP.

?	May consider default project budgets of $2.5MM until an approved DASH is received that commits funds in excess of $2.5MM.

?	SAP has an email notification feature that could be used to alert a designated person/group when a project is approaching or has exceeded budget (within an approved tolerance level).  Some limitations do exist.

?	SAP can be coded to capture unique data (possibly the DASH number) at the project definition level.  Management reports can be generated from the unique field.

?	Reporting features may be enhanced through the current Sunrise project.


Please bring your thoughts and ideas.  See you tomorrow in EB2386 at 9am.

"RE: Data Migration Protocol","Michelle,  Correct me on this one if I am wrong...

In the body of the email distributed yesterday afternoon it says that the form should be sent to Linda Guinn.  I believe she is in the legal department for Enron.  So I would assume she is the person who will track and report on who has and has not submitted their certification letter.

OK

Who is the individual responsible for making sure that 600 plus people will read the 9 pages of protocol and will also verify and collect a signed certification from every new UBS employee by this Friday?  Who will collect Enron's copy of these and hold them and is someone coordinating with UBS directly?

Just received a call from Paul Paulumbo with D&B in NY.  I've given him Kim's number.  In case he doesn't follow-up, one of you should follow-up with him as well (201.291.4809).

Please let me know if you still don't have access to the D&B database after chatting with Paul and/or if Danielle, Dave, Bob, or I need to help with anything.

Kim and Bill,

I just spoke with Danielle Marcinkowski (Enron's point person for access to the outside databases) and she mentioned that she just helped Nicole from Canada with a similar request.  It may be helpful for you guys to chat with Nicole about the process as well (we may need to rely on her access if there's a delay on our end).

Danielle (contact details below) will help coordinate our access to D&B.  Danielle suggested that we also contact Enron's rep at D&B directly (Karen Marcom - contact details below), given our sense of urgency here.  I have also left a message for Danielle, but you should as well.

Enron's DNB Rep in Houston = Karen Marcom 713.953.5406

Enron contact for access to D&B = Danielle Marcinkowski 713.853.7926

Please feel free to contact Bob Shults or myself with questions or concerns, as needed.

Regards,
Rahil

"RE: Releases","Louise,

I talked to Human Resources about providing more specific information for my announcement from John Costas, and they
referred me to you directly. Here are my questions:

1) What are Greg's and your formal titles, in addition to MD? (For example, John Smith, head of XYZ Group. Or are they
CEO, COO, president, or something like that?)
2) What are the other groups reporting into Greg, in addition to Commercial?
3) Do you have a complete management team org chart that we could include in an announcement from Greg (and you?) going
only to UBS Warburg Energy employees? Do you think it appropriate to include this org chart in this announcement? The
plan is to attach Mr. Costas's announcement to Greg's.

Thanks in advance,

Claudia

   Louise,

   Thanks so much for your speedy reply. I will pass your comments on to
   Dave Walker in Media Relations.

   I included Kevin because he is listed with you, Greg and John on a
   ""management"" slide. If there are others who should be
   included on Greg's core management team for the announcement, please let
   me know who they are and their titles. Please
   also let me know if it is inappropriate to include Kevin. If there is an
   org chart, that might be helpful, too. It would
   allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement
   too long.

   Thanks again,

   Just a couple of suggested changes to both.

   There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
   structure of the entity.  Enron had previously announced that the entiy
   would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is
   corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.

   (See attached file: UBSW Energy release draft.doc)
   On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas
   and
   power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have
   removed
   that sentence.
   (See attached file: UBSenergycomreleasedraft.doc)
   Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for
   a
   particular reason?

   Thanks

      Friday (2/8) at about 8 a.m. New York time. The other is planned for
      when the website officially launches, which is
      expected on Monday (2/11).

      Please forward your comments directly to David P. Walker, head of
   Media
      Relations-Americas, sometime on Wednesday.

      Tomorrow, I will send you drafts of the internal announcements for
      Friday and Monday. The plan is to issue on Friday a
      global UBS Warburg email announcement from John Costas, announcing
   the
      new management. I need from Human Resources
      confirmed titles for Louise Kitchen, John Lavorato and Kevin Presto.
   In
      addition, we plan for Friday an email from Greg
      Whalley to employees who have signed on with UBS Warburg Energy, with
      Costas's announcement attached. (Both will also be
      posted on UBS Warburg intranets, including the integration site.)
   There
      will also be internal publicity on the day the
      website launches: another email from Whalley to Energy employees and
      intranet articles within UBS Warburg, including the
      integration site.

      Please let me know if you have questions.

      Thanks,

      Claudia

"Power of Attorney re UBS AG energy trading activities","Louise -- The Houston legal/regulatory group is working with the UBS legal department to obtain from the London branch of UBS AG a power of attorney which will expedite the execution of agreements and other signature documents involved in starting the energy trading activities. (I will provide you specific information on the nature of this power of attorney as soon as I obtain it.)  To get this in place as soon as possible, we've been asked to provide backup information with sufficient specificity that the nature of each relationship/contract and counterparty is identified.  (Example 1: ""Wholesale power trading master purchase and sale agreement with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing L.L.C. and related transaction confirmations"".   Example 2: We would specify the contract and counterparty for each of the 44 gas pipelines which we need to utilize for gas trading operations in ERCOT).  

Accordingly, we will need to get (from Dave Forster?) the names of the priority counterparties, correlated with the list of the agreements we are seeking to complete with each.  I think it would be best if we were also provided such information on other, lower priority, tiers of counterparties, if they have been identified, with whom we seek trading relationships but which were not included in the first priority group who were sent materials.  That way, if lower priority counterparties surface and want to complete trading relationship documents with us, they will be covered by such power of attorney.  I am going to contact Dave Forster this morning to discuss this further.  I am also going to discuss this matter with LLoyd Will, who may be aware of other relationships/agreements pertinent to the start-up of trading operations, say, research oriented relationships involving data feed relationships, software licenses, etc.  

Jim Steffes last night started his group working on this from the standpoint of contracts, registrations, applications, licenses and other regulatory requirements he has identified for the UBS start.   Please contact me with any questions. --David Portz

"Me in Majorca","Hello

Long time no see or hear!!

Thank you for sending me a note - I've only just got into this e mail lark
as we didn't have it on the computors at work until this year - and then I'm
not supposed to be using it oh well.

How is America? I had no idea that you where there or that you had  had a
baby, Denise came to Majorca this summer and she filled me in on peoples
whereabouts.  How old is you little boy and what's his name.

It's winter season here and very little work to do - that's why I am e mail
mad  to try and fill in my time.  Only got 2 days left and then I am
finished until Feb, depending on how things go with bookings etc after New
York.

I usually go home for Christmas every year but my nana died  at the
beginning of the year and now we don't have a base to stay (me, sally and
mum) so i am going home on the 8th of Dec until the 18th and having
Christmas here instead.  My mum has been here for 2 years now, well 2
summers and a bit of winter.  she originally came to help me with Louisa
just after she was born as I went back to work when she was 3 months and mum
looked after her for me during the day, but now as she hasn't got nana to
look after she decided to come back and helps me out a lot as my hours are
not always a straight 9-5.  Louisa goes to nursery during the week  and mum
and I juggle the hours between us ( I say mum and I as Toni is about as
useful as a chocolate fireguard )  My sister is an art director for Vidal
Sasson, doing very well for herself, she runs the new salon in the city in
London and is always jetting of to Japan and other exciting `places, still
single no children but loves Louisa to bits.

Anyway enough about me, how is life in America,  do you work or are you a
lady of leisure?  Louisa is nearly 3, but I imagine your little boy isn't at
school yet is he?  does he look like you or your husband?  Louisa is blond
with blue eyes, nothing like either myself or Toni - she is very much like
my sister and my dad.  I have been at the hospital today to see a specialist
with her as she was born with a lump in her neck (which he has told us will
have to be removed in later years) she also has a mark on the back of her
head and a birthmark between her lip and her nose which a lot of people
comment about but I am very used to.  She has noe to go and see another
specialist about these 2 things and then hopefully eveything will be sorted
out, apart from that ahe is nearly 3 but every thinks she is at least 4 as
she is very tall and well built unfortuanately the only thing she has got
from her father is his Majorcian temperment!!

Say hello to your mum and dad and Paul, if you are in the Uk at the same
time as me let me know as I would love to see you all.  Bye for now

Love Jo and Louisa  xxx

"Direction","Louise,

I am currently working in behalf of the estate of Enron.  That said, I have not been given any direction on what to work on.  My background prior to ENE was natural gas trading-- if there is a need for anyone with a trading background working for the estate in your area, would you please let me know?

Additionally, prior to recent events, Fletch Sturm approached me to trade power.  Unfortunately, I decided to wait till the end of the year.  At some point, after you get everything moving in the right direction, I would be interested in working for you at the new company.

Regards,

Mike Bridges

"RE: Physical in Canada","In order to commence physical trading on February 11th, we are dependent upon the following:

	(1)	Determination of the Canadian entity name for contracting purposes
	(2)	Obtaining financial information for this entity to submit to the pipelines for their credit review
	(3)	3 - 5 business days for the pipeline to process our request

The bottom line is that unless items 1 & 2 can be resolved early next week (preferably by Monday), we will not be able to trade physical gas in Canada on day 1.  We have the pipeline requests essentially completed, but the critical pieces identified above are missing.  Also, I have been informed that under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, we are currently not allowed to contact the pipelines.  I do not have an estimate of when this restriction will be lifted, but this would also impact our ability to obtain the transportation service required to handle physical transactions.

Please let me know if you have additional questions.

"UBS Warburg Energy - First Priority Trading Agreements","Something like this might be appropriate to send to the larger weekly group...please edit, revise, etc..

The first group of trading contracts will go out to 77 companies for a total of 168 counterparties (most companies have multiple entities).  This group obviously does not include everyone, but we have most of our major relationships (and it is the official list that has been submitted to UBS for credit approval.)  

The general marketing plan is as follows:
- Contact all customers this week to tell them about UBS Warburg Energy
- Get contract packages in front of First Priority counterparties this week
- Arrange meetings or follow-up calls as appropriate
- Dave Forster and the ubswenergy.com team will be sending out online PA packages to all parties later this week (so it is important to have contacted all customers)
- Once the initial wave of contracts is out and review/negotiations are uderway, we will submit a Second Priority list for credit approval

The attached file has all of the First Priority counterparties, along with names for gas, power, online, credit and legal.   In addition, we have columns for describing the type of agreement and its status (not pursuing, incomplete, done).  Please complete and/or edit the attached and forward to either Debra Bailey or Lloyd Will.  If you think you should take the lead on a particular counterparty, call up the other marketer and work it out!  Progress on this effort will be reviewed during our twice-weekly calls.

Enron is working to sell its trading and E-Commerce expertise to a strong, highly rated company by January 10. Shortly after deal closure, the new company is expected to launch a new, dedicated website for North American Gas and Power.

OK - here's the sort of thing I am thinking of (still needs Kal's magic).

I suspect you were thinking of a pop-up notice. Given that we aren't really showing anything on EnronOnline at the moment, I suggest we take down EnronOnline entirely and replace it with a splash page which says something like the following:


					COMING SOON

Enron is working with potential industry partners to assemble a new venture which will combine Enron's trading and market - making expertise with the financial strength and reliability of an A rated entity.

Upon formation of this new company, we anticipate that we will be able to announce the launch of a new trading platform for North American gas and power, providing services similar to those previously available on EnronOnline.

Please check back with this site for future updates on plans for the new trading platform.

Lisa - preliminary flows

Day 1 Names:

1.CRC AV Ldn to review list of 162 to check for existing
relationships. The list will be updated with the relevent MF ref so
that DMAC Stam can enhance as required
2.CRC-AV Ldn to add MF static data fields to the list -
RXM/Reporting/Nace etc
3.CRC-AV Ldn to derive RXM details, Nace and reporting codes
4.Distribute
5.DMAC Stam to update MF
6.Whilst DMAC is updating the list, CRC-AV Ldn to vet names using
local research tools. This is the quickest approach. Any names we
cannot identify, we will forward to Debbie Brackett with a request
for info. Debbie should liase with Legal to avoid duplicity. If KYC
docs form part of the Legal assessment, then one of the Legal guys
should be making that statement. We will assume (?)
resolutions/capacity language presumably is included in the ISDA
docs, so not necessary for KYC.

Day 2 Names (process needs to be understood and agreed prior to day 2)

1.Account forms to be revised to cater for new products (Marek to
provide details)
2.Houston CRC/vetting to get familar with forms and requirements
3.New accounts to be raised by Marketer and approved by business head
(who)
4.Marketer sends form and docs to Houston CRC/vetting
5.Houston CRC/vetting conduct KYC/credit assesment in conjunction
with Legal
6.Once approved, Houston CRC/vetting send form (with RXM/reporting
data) to Houston DMAC
7.Houston DMAC send form with UBSWE mnemonic to DMAC Stam
8.DMAC Stam add to MF
9.DMAC Stam send to CRC-AV Ldn

Pls review for discussion on Friday

     Has your follow-on mtg happened - Glass is very concerned about
the
     process for both day 1 and beyond.

     Andy,
     Has a list of FSA vetting reuirements been sent to Debbie
Brackett?
     Bill wants to know what will be an issue since we wil not have
all
     docs day 1?

     How will the process work going forward?

     He wants an update by end of today how Andy vs Credit vs legal
will
     coordinate vetting documentation both for the start up names and
going
     fwd.  Specifically BD resolutions have been problematic at Enron
which
     we know we need for FSA.  Also, what will this A/V group in
Houstone
     be searching for vs what legal is obtaining thru the legal doc
     process.

     Andy- Please take the lead on this.  I will assist whereever I
can.

"Re: Final ISDA Collateral Support Annexes","Carol --

I have reviewed the attached and have only the following minor comments :

Two way form :

1. Page 3, definition of Threshold near bottom of page, change Credit Rating
to ""Credit Ratings"".

2. Page 6, toward bottom of page in Paragraph 13(g)(ii), use defined term
""Credit Rating"" with respect to prospective Custodian.

3.Page 7, instruction for additional representation regarding US bank
counterparty, delete ""DELETE NONE AND"" and insert ""ALSO"". Query, is this
necessary at all, i.e., are US banks among the counterparties for who this
template may be used? See one way form where it is deleted.

4. Schedule 1 (Letter of Credit form), add the word ""hereof"" after the word
""beneficiary"" in the last line of the third to last paragraph and the the
next to last line in the last paragraph. (See one way form.)

One Way form :

1.Page 3, Independent Amounts. Should be ""N/A"" for Party A and ""$0"" for Party
B.

2. Definition of Threshold, page 3-4. Is the MAC concept relevant if it is
defined as a ratings trigger and the Thrshold itself is ratings driven? See
two way form.

3. Page 4, Minimum Transfer Amount will also apply to Party A because of
return obligation under Paragrah 3(b).

4. Paragraph 13 (g), pp.5-7. I thought we were going to revert to the UBS
one-way form and not use the formula as to what happens in 13(g)(ii) with a
downgraded custodian because only UBS will have a custodian in the one-way
agreement. If so please make conforming changes. If not, let's discuss. In
either event, used the defined term ""Credit Rating"" to describe potential
custodians as in two way form. See comment above.

I will be in the NY office around 11am NY time. Phone 212.713.9776. Fax
212.713.1303. I will have access to UBS e-mail there.

Best regards.

"RE: More Portland Issues","Here is a trade for you.  According to the Master Agreement, all technology equipment on Schedule 27 was being conveyed to UBS.  All FF&E on Schedule 18 was not.  It turns out that the Estate in Portland needs some of the technology equipment on Schedule 27.  This includes servers, computers, printers, etc.  We need some of the stuff on Schedule 18 such as the desks and chairs.  We are guaranteed use of this stuff so long as we stay in this building.  Therefore, we could use it forever for free if we chose to stay here.  It seems that we have a fair trade here.  If you don't convey this equipment to us the only effect is that you will likely prevent us from moving as it will be too expensive!!!  An option to buy the equipment from the estate is essentially a worthless option.  The furiture will have little value to the estate and may be a liability as demand for that stuff in Portland is low and the cost to move is high (e.g., in Mexico shutting down the office cost $40k plus storage fees to move furniture into storage).  Furthermore, I have no reason to believe that an accounting firm working for the estate will give us a ""fair"" value on the furniture.  We don't want any furniture from the 4th floor that the estate will need.  Bottom line, we can give the estate computers and servers and they can keep the fourth floor furniture and everything will work well for them.  We give up some computers and servers to the estate but keep the furniture on the 3rd floor.  Everyone is happy and it makes economic sense.

Let's just do this trade that makes sense for everybody.

I have asked Jeff Golden and Don Miller.  Don is leaning towards giving UBS a purchase option at fair market value.  Though I haven't heard from Jeff, he could decide to ""give"" UBS the FF&E now, but he'd probably need to trade it for something else he wants.

Subject: More Portland Issues


It was just brought to my attention by Dave Steiner that the Estate will continue to own the F(urniture), F(ixtures), and E(quipment) and that UBS will be able to use it for free so long as we are in this building.

As you both know, it is possible that we will move from this floor and would like to take a good portion of the FFE with us.  My understanding is that Enron is leasing the furniture in Houston and owns the furniture in Portland.  Therefore, it makes sense for the Houston office to continue to use the furniture but not move it.  It doesn't make as much sense here as it will be expensive for the Estate to dispose of the furniture here and it will be even more expensive to move it to sell it.

Here's the issue -- the Estate should convey the furniture in Portland to UBS.  Is this possible?  What do we need to do to make this happen?

"IT & Back Office Service Agreements","Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office Services to several parties.  Beth has expressed some concerns about the estate's ability to be able to support  a production trading environment once a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate.  Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these services agreements.  Here are some suggestions:

Peggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Services agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.

Bridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has no way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enron for everything from email, internet, network services and office applications as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are concerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in Enron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.

AEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastructure in place and currently provide for their own email and office support services.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA system and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our Pipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications into their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal was to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and suggest that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information from one system to another until they have put in their own integration between the applications listed above.

Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put together a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.

Subject:	Integration Test Planning / Coordination Mtg Summary



Key Planning Assumptions
1) Jan 20 go live
2) New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by Jan 15. This assumes all major production data setup - users, rights, books, global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis. Some code changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ensure the applications still talk to each other. 
3) Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactions from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that applications and interfaces still work. We will not be testing functional permutations, data conditions, validation or exceptions to any significant degree. 
4) Each application conversion team must test their changes before approving their changes for integration testing. We are operating from the premise that data, infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a application system level before the enterprise integration test starts. 
4) All systems will be physically split (even Unify at this point). 
5) Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Estate and New Co. 
6) We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and execution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production. 
7) We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conversion and test team purposes. There are two teams - Conversion and Integration Test. Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co. Resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility. 
8) Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co conversion work can begin in earnest. Estate conversion is on the critical path for New Co. 


Key Issues
1) We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial trading first, then physical. If financial is the focus, delivery risk goes down dramatically. For now, we must plan on the worst case -- physical and financial on Jan 20. 
2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support AEP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we're in synch. 
3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single license of Unify. 
4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for counterparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks. 
5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one trading. 
6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline considerations. The time window will be very small. 


Core Conversion Team  
1) Steve Stock - Applications
2) Bob McAuliffe - Infrastructure
3) Ziyong Wei
4) Steve Nat
5) Dave Nommensen
6) Ken Harmon
7) John Warner
8) Bob Ward

1) Jeff Johnson

6) Due 12/21. Organize meeting with key users and IT contacts to communciate foundation assumptions, context, team and approach for integration test. Develop first cut at sample trade transaction set. Owner: Iain Greig / Aftab Saleem. 
7) Completed. Contact Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Bob Superty, Brice Baxter to communicate above and set up meeting to begin planning with them on the integration testing process. Owner: Jeff Johnson
8) Due 12/21.  Refine core system list with IT owners and Business owners for integration test purposes. Owner: Iain Greig.

"UBS Warburg Energy LLC  Integration Status Report","
All,

The following are highlights of today's Integration Team meeting:

All areas are on track for a successful legal closing of 2/8/02 and
1st day trading of 2/11/02.

Canada:  Three open issues.
	Parent Guarantee
	Some legal entity issues
	Capital/funding requirements

A work plan is in place for all three issues, but may not be
completed by 2/11/02. Worst case, only a few days delay in start
trading. This has NO IMPACT on day one trading in the U.S.

United States:  No ""show stoppers"" in U.S to prevent Legal Close or
First Day Trading.  Open issues are:

	Legal:  Status Green. Clients must have a Master Agreement or
Adoption Agreement or General terms and Conditions (GTC) in place
before trading can commence.  Getting agreements in place is slow
process (2 weeks to 2 months).  Legal and Credit Risk are working
hard to approve as many clients as possible from ""Energy LLC""
approved list of 166. This impacts the number of clients that can
trade on day one.  Business expectations have been set for day one.

	Business:  Status Green.  No additional issues/concerns from
Louise Kitchen, COO, UBS Warburg Energy LLC.  No additional issues
from CFI, or Pat O'Donnel.

	Credit Risk:  Status Green.  For Day one, traders will not have
access to credit information. Credit Risk will distribute list of
approved clients to traders and traders will have to call for credit
approval.

	Mkt. Risk:  Status Green.  Walter Stuerzinger needs to approve
VAR models.  2/7/02 EBK briefing on VAR is important.

	FCD:  Status Green.  Some open issues surrounding SEC
requirements but they are being addressed.  An expedited approval
process will be used to resolve Day one exposure issues if they occur.

	Operations:  Status green.  Lead-time for templates used for
counterparty approvals is 24 hours.  Lead-time for confirmation
templates is 48 hours.  Impact: ""don't make lead-time, don't trade
with this client"".  IR/Derivative settlement process not ready yet,
but being worked by Ops/Credit.

	Corp Comm:  Status Green.  WEB site ""look and feel"" and contents
complete. Need sign off by legal/business (louise Kitchen).  Day one
communications to clients/employees ready.

There will be a conference call on Thurs February 7th at 10:00 EST
where the
""Go""/ ""No-Go"" decision will be made for the Day 0 ""Legal Closing"".
Dial in 19-337-0070, PIN 553815

There will be a conf call on Friday, February 8th, at 10:00 EST,
where the
""Go""/ ""No-Go"" decision will be made for the Day 1 ""Commercial
Integration""
on Monday, February, 11th.  Same dial in number/pin

Subject:	Trader Presentation - Afternoon of Thursday Feb 7

     Tammie-

     Can you kindly confirm details of where, when, # of sessions if
     greater than one, for this presentation.  I understand you are the
     person Louise had designated to help us coordinate the
     presentation/training.  It will be a powerpoint presentation that we
     need your assistance ensuring can be projected as well ensuring the
     traders/business have adequate number of copies of hand out material.

     Attached is the presentation.  Hand outs that we require your
     assistance in handling is:

     - Presentation print out

     - Mercy Gil to supply you with a printed list of contact names phone
     and cell phones by end of day today

     - Wendy Bannerman Clarke to supply the Day 1 Policy (even if still a
     draft) as well as the Discipline and Sanction policy by end of day
     today.

     Tammie - If you can get all the hand outs in 1 pack that would be
     great but it is not required.

     Please speak with Debbie Brackett if you have any questions, issues,
     etc and we thank you very much in advance for your assistance.

     Looking forward to meeting you,
     Lisa Feld

"Mapping Equipment","Dear Louise-

I had a request from Keith Fraley as he was departing...

He is interested in purchasing from Enron the equipment used by his group for the mapping function.  This would include a couple of PC's, a couple of servers and the big plotter.  Is this something that can be pursued?

Please let me know..

Thanks,

Julie  :-)

I was wondering if you could take a look at the attached.  I would like to modify some of it tomorrow and then submit to UBS for approval.  I would like to get your input on this and some other marketing materials we are pulling together.  Give me a call when you have a chance.

"FW: UBS Warburg Energy - First Priority Trading Agreements","
The first group of trading contracts will go out to 77 companies for a total of 168 counterparties (most companies have multiple entities).  This group obviously does not include everyone, but we have most of our major relationships (and it is the official list that has been submitted to UBS for credit approval.)  

The general marketing plan is as follows:
- Contact all customers this week to tell them about UBS Warburg Energy
- Get contract/PA packages in front of First Priority counterparties this week
- Arrange meetings or follow-up calls as appropriate
- Dave Forster and the ubswenergy.com team will be sending out online PA packages to all parties later this week (so it is important to have contacted all customers)
- Once the initial wave of contracts is out and review/negotiations are uderway, we will submit a Second Priority list for credit approval

The attached file has all of the First Priority counterparties, along with names for gas, power, online, credit and legal.   Apologies for the imperfect information - it came from several different sources.  In addition, we have columns for describing the type of agreement and its status (not pursuing, incomplete, done).  Please complete and/or edit the attached and forward to either Debra Bailey or Lloyd Will.  If you think you should take the lead on a particular counterparty, call up the other person and work it out!  Progress on this effort will be reviewed during our twice-weekly calls.

"FW: Sigma Factors","Sanjeev,

We have to seriously rethink these sigma factors.  Since our system only has a product specific sigma, if we try to calculate a 90 day sigma factor we will see significant results which will not represent reality.  For example, if you take the 1 day sigma factor for West Power (18.97) over a 90 day period you will get results that are unreasonable for any short position.  If we sell power at $40 and the 90 day sigma factor is $175, you will get unreasonable results.  We need to think how we can build this given the limitations in the current EOL system.  For test tomorrow, I have recommended we use the existing 1 day sigma factors.  Let me know when you want to discuss.

Bill

Bill may want to do a contract for Sachs at around 20/20. He's thinking about it and will let me know. Apparently RWE are chasing him.

NETCo ee's with nearly 5 years service at Enron
We have about 10 people who had they stayed at Enron estate for another 30 - 60 days would have vested in the Enron pension plan (cash-balance plan). We have tried to find some way to make something work here, but as it stands it looks like the are going to have to transfer on 8th of Feb and forfeit whatever was in this plan (roughly 5% of base salary per year and it is a 5 year service vesting arrangement). You may hear some noise.

"RE: Portland","I understand that the lease assignment needs to happen.  However, it is my understanding from talking directly to the landlord that they are modifying the lease to require us to pay for certain separatioon costs and upgrades to their facilities (e.g., security access to all of their floors in this building).  The landlord has also agreed, in concept, to provide us a six month option at the beginning of the term.  

Based on discussions with you yesterday, it seemed that UBSW was not willing to insert any of the language that I wanted into the lease (e.g., six month option to get out), but was willing to insert language that the landlord wanted (obligating UBSW to several $100k of costs).  Why would UBSW do this?  

I recommend that we either (1) make the landlord's changes and my changes this week or (2) make no changes this week and work to get the lease that both sides want next week.

CONFIDENTIAL:
Tim,
As discussed the Portland Lease is proposed to be assigned from Enron 
North America Corp. to UBS AG (or UBS Warburg Energy LTD.). The 
bankruptcy judge has only approved a full assignment and therefore a 
partial assignment (e.g. for the 3rd floor for 15,615.64 rsf) would not 
be possible. Enron in turn is expected to sublease the 4th floor 
(5,563.11 rsf). This Assigment of this Lease Agreement requires the 
written consent of the Landlord (Portland General Electric Company), 
which should be received within 30 days. All lease agreements with 
Enron (including Portland) are expected to be executed this week as 
part of the Legal Closing, scheduled for 2/08/02.
We understand that the Landlord would like to recapture our space ASAP. 
The longer term space needs may only be approx. 10,000 rsf. Therefore a 
relocation may be feasible. However it is my understanding that issues 
related to a possible relocation would be discussed with all parties 
involved (incl. Landlord) only after the Legal Closing.
Regards
Markus
