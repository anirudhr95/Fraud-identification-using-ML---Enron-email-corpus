Subject: Plant Outage List


I am waiting for a response to an email I sent 1 month ago regarding your
database of facilities used to generate the daily plant outage list.  I
would like to cross reference the outage information you provide with other
data from other sources and would like an efficient way to ""join"" the data.
It would be helpful to me if I had a table of plants showing your text name
and a unique ISO or WSCC identifying code.  I can be reached at 713-853-0472
for any questions regarding this request.  Thank you.

Matt,
   It looks like Enron has only one active contract on QPC.  That is a release capacity contract from Chalk Creek to the Wasatch Front.  I can provide daily data on that point for the period during which the contract is effective if you would like.

Because we do not offer the other data you  have requested to all shippers on the pipeline, I can not respond fully to your request for historical data on all or most points on the pipeline.

Once again I would suggest that you refer to our website (www.questarpipeline.com) to begin gathering the information you need from this point forward.  I would be happy to answer any questions  you may have regarding data posted on the web site

Janie

As we discussed, we would like you to consider adding the OXY point for Elk
Hills deliveries into SOCAL at the Gosford intertie to the ""NGI Socal/PG&E
KRS"" physical point. If you look on SOCAL's System Operations report our
deliveries are listed as ""Elk Hills - Gosford Intertie"". Our flows on this
pipeline typically range from 80MM to 165MM/day.

Our gas from  this point interconnects with the PG&E Kern River station gas
that then is delivered through Wheeler Ridge into SOCAL.

Separately we would also be very interested in an SOCAL In state Production
point on Enron OnLine.

Enter

Of course, a slight pause between the keystokes might be needed.  And if we need to maintain activity to keep the system from kicking us out, we can simply use two Enter keystrokes.  Please let me know when you'll be able to give this a shot.

Thanks for checking into it.  Coincidently, I noticed that there is a line on my phone called Portland #2 that noone uses.  If it's listed on the phone does that mean that it's necessarily there?

Ina,

It's getting even more complicated.  I forgot that the Portland office is also going through major renovation and system upgrades that would also effect the possibility of installing such a circuit.  At this time, because of the uncertainty of what items are being changed, moved or upgraded at each location and when these events would occur, makes the reliability of this circuit a major issue and should not be attempted until both locations have completed their locations' projects.

Ina,

I would have to investigate further to determine if this can be done, however, at this time we are not accepting any new circuits for the Trading floors because of the pending moves to ECS.  Direct circuits using Enron facilities is difficult when equipment using the circuit is in ECS and the equipment establishing the circuit to Portland is in ECN.  There are potential reliability problems.

Let me do some checking.

Darren,

What would the cost be to se up a direct line between Portland and The West Gas Desk?  Are there any switches available for this where there would not be a cost?

Let me know what my options are.

This is sumas.   Also, you are correct, that all you need to do, is add this value to the others (nymex + basis + index).  Let me know if you need anything else.

Matt,
Thank you for the codes!  What are the correct calculations for the heatrates?  When determining the gas price, do I take the prices that I've been using and add the index value using the codes that you sent me?  Do you know the code for Sumas?  
Thanks,

rental properties located near water) we quickly determined that that option
is near impossible at this late date.....	So, now we are trying a few last

the sandbar with Kelly and Mike and their boat, bbq, beer and oh yea, lot's
of beer.  Come to think of it, that sounds great.  I think a few of my

"RE:","Hey,

You better do something about the crappy weather.  I mean, am I going to have to bring my ski jacket?  So, I'm planning on going into the office early on Friday, but I'll be done by 9 am probably.  Don't feel like you have to take any time off because of me.  I'll find plenty to do with people from the office or by myself (like make up sleep for when I get up at 5 am to go into the office).  So, I'll take care of a dinner venue and accomodations for Saturday night, but other activities are in the air.  If Bonneville is on the way, that's cool.  I suppose there's probably some cool hikes/drives around the area with great views.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.  Anyway, today was pretty hectic as well here, but now its quiet, and I'm ready to go home....and look at that, it's 5:30 already! 

Hope you're staying warm and dry.

Matt,

You have exceeded your VaR limit.  Per the rules set by John Lavorato I will have to take $100,000 from your P&L tonight.  If you are still over your limit tomorrow morning, the penalty will be $1,000,000.

"p&l","Kam,

Hey, there's a nymex sale of 5000 /day Dec at 2.945 that shows up as a changed deal in my P&L from last night.  The deal is a valid sale that I executed, but it does not appear to be valued correctly.  It's valued at $3,096 when nymex was marked at 2.735 so the value should have been $32,550.  I would contact Ashley directly, but I don't know her last name.  Thanks.

Hey there!

How was your birthday?  I wasn't able to get ahold of
you.  I feel badly because I wanted to wish you a
Happy one.  I hope that it was, and that you were able
to relax a little bit.

Do you know your new phone number?  I would like to
talk with you soon if you do.  I have news to tell
you!
Tis weekend is a long weekend.  I was originally
supposed to go to Boston, but Loretta and I changed
our minds.  I think she is moving into a new place
this weekend.

I hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.

Christine:)

"FW: Questar Historicals","Becky,

I recently requested historical flow information from Questar pipeline.  In their response they indicated that they will only provide flows for the one or two locations for which Enron has capacity allocations.  Chris Gaskill indicated that you would be able to comment on whether this is consistent with the FERC 637 reporting requirements.  We wish to aquire historical flows for all metered points currently reported daily on Questars website (only 30 days history is available on their system) from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I have attached my original request and Questar's response.  Feel free to call with questions (3-0472).  Thank you in advance.

Mathew Smith


Gerry,

Per our conversation, I am requesting historical scheduled (final cycle) quantities for Questar Pipeline meter points.  Questar previously provided flows up to June of 2000.  We are now requesting from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I would prefer the information be emailed to me.  Otherwise the postal address is:  Rm#3299E, 1400 Smith St., Houston, TX 77002.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions at 713-853-0472.  Thank you.

Mathew Smith

Matt,
   It looks like Enron has only one active contract on QPC.  That is a release capacity contract from Chalk Creek to the Wasatch Front.  I can provide daily data on that point for the period during which the contract is effective if you would like.

Because we do not offer the other data you  have requested to all shippers on the pipeline, I can not respond fully to your request for historical data on all or most points on the pipeline.

Once again I would suggest that you refer to our website (www.questarpipeline.com) to begin gathering the information you need from this point forward.  I would be happy to answer any questions  you may have regarding data posted on the web site

Subject:	Greetings


Matt,
 
Long time no  hear, hope you're doing fine at the new company. Sorry to bother you  with this issue again since I know Leo Sommaripa has contacted you  already, so I'll be brief and to the point. 
 
We have been  trying to save a copy of the Database on a CD-R so that we can give it to the  client for their reference but some issues have come up which have to do with  programming. Our intention is for the client to keep the database in the CD and  to be able to access all the features in it so that there is no need for them to  copy it unto a hard drive and possibly modify the data.  Since by saving it unto a CD makes the database  read-only, there's no problem with keeping the data on the disk intact, and  we're even working on a disclaimer to paste on the database.  
 
The problem is  that by making it into a read-only file, some commands have become disabled.  Specifically, the buttons on the review form that access the compliance,  operations, equipment, and staffing forms are not available through the  read-only format. I ventured into the programming codes for the commands and  found the following string on all four buttons:

I temporarily  deleted that line from the programming codes for all four and so far have not  had any problems with accessing all levels of the database in the CD. Now, I do  not know exactly what that string does to the database but would much rather  find a safer alternative if possible or at least know that the string is  not a critical part of the process. If this is something that can be answered  right off the bat I'd appreciate it, I realize that this is not a priority  anymore so if its something that will consume  a extended period of time,  let me know and I will continue seraching through other  channels.
 
I guess this  wasn't brief after all and I appreciate the time and effort. I can be  emailed or I can make the arrangements to call you, whatever's better for  you.

"PGE Deals","Phillip,

Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.  Our exposure  on the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 mil to $71.  Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.  The spreadsheet shows five synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong counterparty in our system.  I'm at the office and will be here through the meeting.  My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.

Hey, I checked out the test chart you did for outages.  Nice work!  I'm already thinking of many other things we'd like to have.  Does this charting tool, allow us to customize the chart features to the extent excel does?  Can you manually set the min and max values on the axis?  We like some of the charts to have the same axis settings so that the bars can be compared from one chart to the next.  If so, Jason can tell you how we'd like them set.  Let's also discuss what interactivity we can build into this page.

We may have to request a check to pay for the information in advance, if my past experience is any indication.  What is your RC number, or would Tara be able to take care of it?  

Also, did you send this message before you finished it?  Looks like the last sentence is incomplete!  I assumed that you meant she would be my contact while you are gone.

"Storage Balances","Chris,

Per our conversation, the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track/compute/report, etc.


Background

The west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports.  These balances are not reported by the respective pipelines, however, each day the injections and withdrawals are available.  In the past, our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior day's balance.  As we get validation of the balances through phone calls, and/or postings, we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation.  Currently, our reporting/storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports.

Task

Synthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table.  It is our intent to have a DRN established (and some already have been created) that would hold the storage balance each day.  However, this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database.  One possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped.  Another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report, while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity.  Lastly, these storage balances could be manual entry points, but would require manual calculation each day (representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature).

Timeline

This is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets.  At a minimum, we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week.  Although, we do not have a final date for transitioning, we see this as one of a few critical tasks.

"data changes","Angela,

CIG (#42) is almost complete, but we have a few data changes to make:

First, for DRN 24906 Big Blue Meter Station, please replace the utilized capacity values of the records with effective date 4/2/01 to 4/8/01 with values below listed from 4/2/01 to 4/8/01 and delete records with effective date 4/21/01.  Also, please change all historicals from receipts to deliveries.

39014 	
39982 	
32987 	
44781 	
41381 	
41357 	
40586 	


Second, for DRN 16688 Keyes, Town of, please delete both the receipt and delivery records for effective data 4/21/01 and the receipt record for effective date 4/8/01.

I stumbled across a few problems with CIG/WIC.  First, location 2776 for pipeline has historicals loaded with flow type ""D"" yet new data is scraped with flow type ""T"".  Let's change all D's to T's.  Where dates overlap (key violations), just leave the existing Ts and scrap the Ds.  Second, please move the usage data for 279577 with pipeline number 6 to the same DRN with pipeline number 43 and delete the location under pipeline 6, as this is a manually entered point.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Anytime after 3 will be best for me since it is bid week.  Just let me know what works.

Enron fires two employees linked to partnerships

    NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. <ENE.N>, the
embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer
and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of
its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by
U.S. regulators.
    Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan,
managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina
Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division.
    Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with
four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in
a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with
Enron.
   Shares of Enron were trading down 5 cents or .55 percent at
$9 on the New York Stock Exchange.

I am glad to hear that you're not freaking out.  As for Kate, she is pretty
much ambiguous to the whole thing.  She doesn't have and money invested in
Enron, so if she looses her job she won't be that sad.  I talked to her last
night and she seemed not to care one way or the other.  She said that
yesterday the traders were freaking out and most of them left the office for
""lunch"" and didn't come back.  So, you aren't sure what you're going to do?
At least you have options.  Kate and I are going to see some motorcross
tonight and have some white-trash loving fun.  It should be interesting
people watching.  Kate said she going to find herself a mullet.  Any big

How's Kate doing?  are they worried?  there probably aren't a ton of

Matt,

There was a problem with your book on Friday night.  The IT group did not have it ready to calculate so I was unable to report it.  They will have this done today and I will then load your positions into TDS.  As of Friday you were short 30 NYMEX contracts in Dec-01.

Sorry for the delay.

Have not heard anything, and I've haven't had a chance to get back with her.  Since I didn't talk to her until late Monday, I didn't really expect to hear from her yesterday anyway.  I will follow up as soon as I get a chance.

We may have to request a check to pay for the information in advance, if my past experience is any indication.  What is your RC number, or would Tara be able to take care of it?  

Also, did you send this message before you finished it?  Looks like the last sentence is incomplete!  I assumed that you meant she would be my contact while you are gone.

"new page to scrape","Chris,

I recently found out that Questar posts a Clay Basin storage inventory in html on their website.  The link is http://www.questarpipeline.com/html/qpc_capacity.html.  We will need to start scraping this balance, specifically the ""Total Clay Basin Annual Working Gas"" and ""Total clay Basin Reservoir Inventory"".  This does not impact the storage Inventory issue that we've previously discussed, since this balance is currently a manual entry point, and will continue to be even after we start scraping these points.  Please give me a realistic estimate of when we can begin scraping this data.  We will need to create DRN's for both of these points.  Clearly, in terms of priorities, working out the bigger storage inventory balance issue is much higher priority.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hey, glad to know you are recovering swiftly from Friday nights festivities.  I think I just might have finally kicked my hangover.  Joe said he woke up early Saturday morning to find me passed out in my clothes face down on the couch with the cat snuggling up against me.  As exhausted as I was, I had to meet keith at the office Sat. and then went to a party Sat night where some asshole at the party backed into my car and didn't even come in and tell me!  Now I have to play detective to find out who did it.  Anyway, I had a great time hanging out Friday night and I'm glad you did too.  Hope to see you around soon.  Give me a call if you're going to be around anytime.

Susan and I are suffering from extreme neck pain this weekend from 
overenthusiastic dancing to ""Nookie"" at the Swan.  Just wanted to say thanks 
for hanging out, I really had a good time.  I didn't think I was going to 
get my second wind after dinner but I was pleasantly suprised.  I had a 
monster hangover on Saturday and did not get out of pj's until 4pm..it was 
pathetic.  But I had a great time and its only fitting that I get sloshed on 
my last day.  Take care and catch you sometime at the FP or Lil W.

"RE:","Dave,

As discussed, I need to have daily power outages summarized by Natural Gas (NG) type plants and everything but NG for each WSCC region for the previous year and one year into the future.  The historical part of this task should be considered a higher priority.  Initially, I only need the results in Excel format so the West desk can work it into their forcasts.  We do not need any web interface at this time (maybe in the future).  Please let me know how long you think this would take and your availability as soon as possible.  If we can't get it done relatively quickly (say by wednesday), we might have to try a different route.  Thanks.

Subject:	MDX NULL Status

Eliminating the effect NULL values have on MDX AVG's in History is progressing but has been filled with additional problems.

The solution to divide the sum from the cube by the count of nonnull days from SQL is practically done. In addition to 
all day Friday.  Five hours were put in over the weekend.  Much of this time has been spent resolving the underlying problems
that pose a problem to consistiency of results..

Done:
Develop query -- spRPT_GetAllDaysWithData
Parameterize query
Modify Program structure to call query with necessary parameters
Determine most complete cycle to use (Get cycle with most number of days of data) 
Verify Queries -- Started

To Do:
Determine how to use all retrieved cycles in NonNullDaysCount query.
Prove this approach is workable.

Matt,
 
Long time no  hear, hope you're doing fine at the new company. Sorry to bother you  with this issue again since I know Leo Sommaripa has contacted you  already, so I'll be brief and to the point. 
 
We have been  trying to save a copy of the Database on a CD-R so that we can give it to the  client for their reference but some issues have come up which have to do with  programming. Our intention is for the client to keep the database in the CD and  to be able to access all the features in it so that there is no need for them to  copy it unto a hard drive and possibly modify the data.  Since by saving it unto a CD makes the database  read-only, there's no problem with keeping the data on the disk intact, and  we're even working on a disclaimer to paste on the database.  
 
The problem is  that by making it into a read-only file, some commands have become disabled.  Specifically, the buttons on the review form that access the compliance,  operations, equipment, and staffing forms are not available through the  read-only format. I ventured into the programming codes for the commands and  found the following string on all four buttons:
 
DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acRecordsMenu,  acSaveRecord, , acMenuVer70
 
I temporarily  deleted that line from the programming codes for all four and so far have not  had any problems with accessing all levels of the database in the CD. Now, I do  not know exactly what that string does to the database but would much rather  find a safer alternative if possible or at least know that the string is  not a critical part of the process. If this is something that can be answered  right off the bat I'd appreciate it, I realize that this is not a priority  anymore so if its something that will consume  a extended period of time,  let me know and I will continue seraching through other  channels.
 
I guess this  wasn't brief after all and I appreciate the time and effort. I can be  emailed or I can make the arrangements to call you, whatever's better for  you.

Hey,
Please send me Mat Smith's email.  I need to send him an email to get
him motivated to make the Whistler trip and I wanted to get his email
from you anyway.

I'll do a little more research on pricing.  For now tell him this:

Dates: arrive March 2nd and leave March 9th
Lodging:  $400 - $800 per person for 7 nights for 1 bdrm w/ kitchen,
walking dist. to lifts
Airfare:  $0 - $500 or so
Lift tickets:  $200-$250 for 6 tickets
Ground Trans.:  $60-$80 round trip from Vancouver to Whistler on shuttle

Food & drink:  ???, but the exchange rate is kicking ass at 1:1.55 and
the places we are looking at have a full kitchen with a fridge to hold
plenty of Molson

5000 ft of vertical and the best mountain base night life around, how
can you pass this up?

Later,

Brooks

"pge","Chris,

Remember way back when......we threw out a bunch of PGE (#17) data that we were going to reload from the saved html files?  Anyway, it looks like we're missing data from 2/7/01 through 3/12/01.  As we discussed, we should have the html files so can we run those through the transform and get them into the database?  Let me know if there are any issues.

Great.  As we discussed, we'll need the final query to list all counterparties for each product with net quantities stated for each day (dates listed as column headings) of the current month.  Ideally, the query will be executed daily and posted in html or xls on the Gas Fundy website.  I understand that we do not yet have permission from EOL to hit their database regularly and that you will have someone else from your team finish out this task.  I'm available today to help any way I can.  Thanks.

Jason (et al):

We are approaching somewhat of a slow-down in active harvesting development, and therefore it is a prime opportunity to begin hashing out what is required to gather the West Power load data you have previously mentioned.  We should get together personally to better organize this initiative, but some things to ""prime the pump"" are:

1)  What are the requisite sites involved?  (URLs, etc)
2)  What is the frequency of ""jobs""?  (how often do we scrape the data; once a day, x number of time a day, etc).
3)  What is the nature of the data we are scraping?  (this will help us to determine if we already have a database schema that this will fit into, or if we need to extend/develop one)

These are just some topics to get us started...you may have already answered some/all of these previously, but I feel they deserve mentioning again, if for no other reason than to make sure we are all on the same page moving forward.

Please reply with your availability over the next few days (as well as anyone else you feel should be involved in this effort), and I will have Amanda schedule a meeting/room for us to get this started.

Thanks,
Chris

Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key violations as well.  These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key violation):

458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR - 3553
611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001) - 37032
608 NOVELTY HILL M/S - (mkup one)
612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001) - 2603


If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be great.  If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.

Thanks,
Chris

How's this for starters...

 

The San Juan plant receipts and Rockies production information should be accurate.  The third tab, Keystone Receipts, is definitely not comprehensive.  That information is for El Paso Natural Gas only, and only the first section of the table has the receipt points values.  Unfortunately, a lot of production in Keystone moves onto intrastate pipelines that we do not have data for.  I'll see if I can get together at least some TW and Northern numbers for the Perm and that might be as good as we can get.

Dave,

Hey, I checked out the test chart you did for outages.  Nice work!  I'm already thinking of many other things we'd like to have.  Does this charting tool, allow us to customize the chart features to the extent excel does?  Can you manually set the min and max values on the axis?  We like some of the charts to have the same axis settings so that the bars can be compared from one chart to the next.  If so, Jason can tell you how we'd like them set.  Let's also discuss what interactivity we can build into this page.

"another PGE point","Chris,

I assumed we were scaping the ""Inventory Chagne"" point for PGE, but it doesn't look like any data is in the database.  Can you check on this.  It's the last row of the larger tables on the webpage.  The location name I believe is Inventory Chang.  If it's not being scaped, let's get it started.

"HR Position","Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Mat

Matt,

You're positions will not show up tonight until we ""load"" them.  This will be done once your P&L is calculated for the night.  After tonight, your trades will hit immediately after they are executed.

Please call with any questions.

Subject:	Manual Entry

I have the Manual Entry process ready for testing again (testing as in testing by the analysts).  I would prefer to have it used by the analysts at least for a few days to iron out any more potential ""bugs"" before releasing it to users on the floor.  If the consensus is to have people on the floor be the testers, that is fine as well, as long as they know that the following URL points to a development server.

Without further ado, the link to the Manual Entry Page:

http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

As stated in the above URL, this is located on the DEVELOPMENT web server.  Users should honestly never be directed to this URL, unless authorized by one of the site developers, since anything on it is subject to be currently in development (read: potentially broken).

Anyway, here are some things that have been added to the Manual Entry piece in this release:

""Previous"" data now reflects information in the DB for the latest effective date for the selected cycle (not just ""Yesterday"" as before)...
There is now an option to enter data for a ""special cycle 0""...this is to be used on occasions where no data was scraped (for whatever reason), but there is some available that can be manually entered.  Selecting this option causes ALL points for a given pipeline to be displayed (both normally scraped points AND manually entered points).  A cycle of '0' is applied to this data, and it should only show up on reports until valid scrape data becomes available (since the report engine is designed to pull the latest cycle available).
You can now add ""extra"" line items to be stored in the DB...this is to be used when you must enter data for more than one flow type for a given point (i.e. the point is reported as both a Receipt and a Delivery).  This should normally only have to be done the first time data is entered for that pipe, since the ""Previous"" data will handle pulling in and displaying (the next time) every flow type stored for every point on the pipe.

NOTE:  It is set to only allow 1 extra point to be added...this was done to simplify the handling of this feature; I'm open to discussion if you feel there is a need to enter more than one extra point (I see it as a Receipt/Delivery issue...will a point ever be more than that?  Receipt/Delivery/Storage or something?)

I have also fixed the ""Exceptions Occurred"" bug that cropped up recently...this was caused by moving the manually entered points to their own unique pipeline ids.  The Jaguar system did not get updated to account for that, but it is updated now.

Aside from the above, minor tweaks here and there have also been made.  I am going to enlist the aid of Junellen to ""beautify"" the layout, but provided no more bugs appear during testing this should be good to go into production by the beginning of next week.

Any questions, feel free to ask or reply.

Thanks,
Chris

"Report Time","Yan,

As discussed, it is acceptable to rerun the cube at 6:30 am.  After the the refresh, the following West reports should be generated:  #25 CIG_WIC (daily), #40 Rockies Production (daily), and #9 Socal (daily, historical, merge).  Also, please generate the west flow summary report at 6:15 am.  In addition, #22 West_2 (daily and historical) and #38 West_3 (daily and historical) which run before the 2nd cube refresh should be among the first report run after the 1st cube run because they will be the first reports accessed in the morning by Patti (roughly 5:30am).  Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.

"RE: trips, chixs and other fancy things","Hey, what up?  i'm still in Portland, in the office right now.  Had a pretty cool time this weekend.  Checked out Hood River, a little town on the Columbia River Gorge and then headed up to Mt. Hood yesterday.  I think its about 11,000 ft high. There's a really old lodge half way up...it was almost snowing!  Actually, up near the summit you can ski year round....but i don't think many people do.  The little trip made me think about our ski plans, which we should definitely keep pursueing.  I apologize i'm a little out of touch up here in Portland, maybe I'll do some surfing when i get a chance.  So, this chick fun...i don't really know what it is, but i feel comfortable hanging out with her...I think maybe its just that she's pretty down to earth.  She ski's a lot and plays soccer every week, so i guess there some common interests there.  She's totally not into fancy expensive things...which is good because she's broke...want's to go back to school so she can teach.  Only other comment is that she's got a little hippie in her...but i guess you can't have everything...
 
Anyway, I took some pictures, so I'll send them to you sometime.  I have to run.  Thanks for the email. 
 
Talk to you soon.

Hey Matteo,

How's everything goin?  SO, I am so pumped about Utah.  I talked with my
friend Jeff and he told me so much more about Park City, skiing there, where
to go, the night life and the Sundance Festival.  He is going to write up a
bunch of stuff for us and would like to meet up with us for a day or two as
well.  We are planning on Martin Luther King weekend still??

I was thinking that maybe Brad and Heather might like to go as well.  Sent
out the invite to a few people, will know more by the end of the week.  I
say let's get the tickets and start planning.  Once I get the specifics on
ski places from Jeff, I'll have a better idea of where would be the best
place to crash.  By then maybe we will have a few more people commited and
can make a decision.  Sweet!

Also, last night I brought up the idea (to Duncan) of going to Australia in
February for a few weeks.  I know that you and Jeff have been thinking about
it.  Just thought I would let you know that we are too.

So, how did your weekend go with the chica????   love, k

Subject:	Harvesting Issues on 05/19/2001

We appeared to have some problems with a couple of web sites on Saturday
evening / Sunday afternoon.  Unfortunately, I was not home at that time to
be able to reset them.  Upon returning home this evening (Sunday), I took a
look and the following cycles did not get scraped:

05/19/2001
Kern, Cycles 2 & 4
Transco Cycle 2

05/20/2001
KM (Points R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
Transcolorado (R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
Kern, Cycle 3
Northwest, Cycle 6

I have reset all of the jobs...unfortunately, I suspect there is data loss
for the above cycles. One of our ""old friends"", the 1line Williams site, is
definately the cause for the Northwest, Kern and Transco misses.  This site
still appears to be having problems, so it should be checked for the next
couple of days.  When trying to go to it tonight, I received various errors,
and the general site layout appeared different since the last time I looked
(this means they could potentially change the layout of the page we get data
from as well).

As I write this, ""capture"" jobs for Kern, Northwest, and Transco are failing
due to ""Internal Server Errors"".

Hopefully, this is a short-term problem, and these sites will stabilize
soon.  The bright side of this story is that the Jaguar system did exactly
what it was supposed to do when these problems occur...it retried until the
job attempts seemed fruitless, then it sent pages to report the problems.

"Plant Outage Task","Colin,

Per our conversation, I have outlined Keith's task for the team....

Background:  Portland maintains in their database a table called ""PlantOutage"".  Records in that table each contain an outage ""BeginOutageDate"", ""EndOutageDate"", ""CapacityOut"" and ""OutageReason"".  Records also include a PlantID (key field for PlantCharacteristics table) and a PlantUnitID (key field for Unitcharacteristics table).  The PlantCharacteristics table contains a ""WSCCRegion"" field and the Unitcharacteristics table contains a ""Fuel_Designation"" field.  

Portland has a stored procedure that for a specified date range can calculate for each date the sum of ""CapacityOut"" for all outage records where the date falls between the ""BeginOutageDate"" and the ""EndOutageDate"".  I have inlcuded the results of this storaged procedure in the attached file.  Our task is similar but requires more detailed subgrouping of the data.

Objective:  The objective is to return the Sum of ""CapacityOut"" by each possible subgrouping for each day in a range (say 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2001).  There are roughly five possible parameters for ""Fuel_Designation"", seven for ""WSCCRegion"", and two for ""OutageReason"".  The resulting query would return approximately 70 values for each day within the specified range.

Format:  Ultimately we will have the date in one excel sheet with dates down the left and each of the 70 sub groupings across the top.  It would be most convenient if the results of the query were formatted in this way.  Alternatively, we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided.  If the second option is used, we will need to get the data in two separate lists since excel can only hand 65,000+ rows.  In this case, we would use the ""OutageReason"" grouping (which only has two parameters) to split out the two lists.  


Thanks for your help.

Mat

"SW flows","Charles,

The attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced Southwest Gas meter points off of El Paso, Kern and PG&E.  As I indicated earlier, SWG may have deliveries off of Socal which we would not be able to see.  Also, there may be unidentified SWG meter points not included in the attached file, and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher.  Finally, if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis, one should be careful which prices they use for comparison.  SWG territory in California would be subject to California pricing, while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently.  In addition, Southwest Gas owns transport capacity on El Paso, such that they were really only vulnerable to San Juan or Keystone price fluxuations, and not Socal.  You could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity, which I do not (it is available on El Paso's website).  Anyway, that's all I have.

"Storage Value","Jody,

I have not confirmed that these are the correct values, but this should get you started.  These are based on Socal's published long-term storage tariff.  I cannot confirm whether Socal has capacity at these rates available to sell.  Keep in mind I don't think the LNG project would incur the entire cost of the storage, as ENA could extract additional value from optimizing its operation.  It appears the cost is quite sensitive to the winter withdrawal rights, which I do not see any way around unless we can unload more of the cargo directly into the system and bypass the storage facility during the winter.  Please do not hesitate to call with any questions.

Let me know if you have any questions regarding park city.  I think the

through there to find it.
Take care,

Subject:	SW flows

Charles,

The attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced Southwest Gas meter points off of El Paso, Kern and PG&E.  As I indicated earlier, SWG may have deliveries off of Socal which we would not be able to see.  Also, there may be unidentified SWG meter points not included in the attached file, and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher.  Finally, if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis, one should be careful which prices they use for comparison.  SWG territory in California would be subject to California pricing, while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently.  In addition, Southwest Gas owns transport capacity on El Paso, such that they were really only vulnerable to San Juan or Keystone price fluxuations, and not Socal.  You could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity, which I do not (it is available on El Paso's website).  Anyway, that's all I have.

Mat

Junky-Junk.



Moody's cuts Enron's ratings, may cut again

    NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's
Investors Service on Friday said it cut its long-term and
short-term ratings for embattled energy trader Enron Corp.
<ENE.N> and warned it could cut the ratings again because of a
substantial loss of investor confidence.
    Moody's cut Enron's senior unsecured debt ratings to
""Baa3,"" its lowest investment grade, from ""Baa2."" It also cut
the company's commercial paper rating to ""Not Prime"" from
""Prime-2.""
    If Moody's cut Enron's long-term rating again, it would
take it to a junk level. A downgrade would make it tougher for
Enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business. The
downgrade also adds uncertainty to a potential merger with
rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N>, which has been in talks to acquire
Enron.
    Dynegy and Enron have asked for an expedited review of the
merger from Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
    Enron shares traded Friday on the New York Stock Exchange
down $1.15 at $7.25.

We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you need more info.

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Mat

For the following dates, we do not have Cycle 7 data in the database for PG&E (Pipeline #17).  These should have been reloaded from the saved html files.  Do we have these files, and if so, can you load the appropriate dates, in order the get the Cycle 7 data in for these points.

3/7/01	
3/8/01	
3/9/01	
3/10/01	
3/11/01	
3/12/01	


For the following dates, the data we have for Cycle 7 in the database does not match that in the spreadsheet that the west desk maintains.  We need to verify from the saved webpages whether our data is correct, and if it isn't, get it corrected.  I could check them, if you could print out the saved pages for me.	

2/12/01
2/27/01 
3/1/01 
4/11/01 	
4/16/01 	
4/17/01

For both of these, the actual date of capture will be several days later than the effective date for cycle 7.
