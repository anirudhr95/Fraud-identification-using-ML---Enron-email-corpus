"RE: Manual Entry","Chris,

It seems like a test should include the final users of the manual entry - the fundamentals group can test it first, but Kevin Brady and Patti Sullivan are the ones that have to use it everyday.  My final point:  everyone listed on this e-mail needs to understand the urgency of finishing the scraping/reporting of the pipeline data.  After all, we are only three months beyond our original target date for the West and two months behind for the Central.  If you have any questions, see me.

Subject:	Manual Entry

I have the Manual Entry process ready for testing again (testing as in testing by the analysts).  I would prefer to have it used by the analysts at least for a few days to iron out any more potential ""bugs"" before releasing it to users on the floor.  If the consensus is to have people on the floor be the testers, that is fine as well, as long as they know that the following URL points to a development server.

Without further ado, the link to the Manual Entry Page:

http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

As stated in the above URL, this is located on the DEVELOPMENT web server.  Users should honestly never be directed to this URL, unless authorized by one of the site developers, since anything on it is subject to be currently in development (read: potentially broken).

Anyway, here are some things that have been added to the Manual Entry piece in this release:

""Previous"" data now reflects information in the DB for the latest effective date for the selected cycle (not just ""Yesterday"" as before)...
There is now an option to enter data for a ""special cycle 0""...this is to be used on occasions where no data was scraped (for whatever reason), but there is some available that can be manually entered.  Selecting this option causes ALL points for a given pipeline to be displayed (both normally scraped points AND manually entered points).  A cycle of '0' is applied to this data, and it should only show up on reports until valid scrape data becomes available (since the report engine is designed to pull the latest cycle available).
You can now add ""extra"" line items to be stored in the DB...this is to be used when you must enter data for more than one flow type for a given point (i.e. the point is reported as both a Receipt and a Delivery).  This should normally only have to be done the first time data is entered for that pipe, since the ""Previous"" data will handle pulling in and displaying (the next time) every flow type stored for every point on the pipe.

NOTE:  It is set to only allow 1 extra point to be added...this was done to simplify the handling of this feature; I'm open to discussion if you feel there is a need to enter more than one extra point (I see it as a Receipt/Delivery issue...will a point ever be more than that?  Receipt/Delivery/Storage or something?)

I have also fixed the ""Exceptions Occurred"" bug that cropped up recently...this was caused by moving the manually entered points to their own unique pipeline ids.  The Jaguar system did not get updated to account for that, but it is updated now.

Aside from the above, minor tweaks here and there have also been made.  I am going to enlist the aid of Junellen to ""beautify"" the layout, but provided no more bugs appear during testing this should be good to go into production by the beginning of next week.

Any questions, feel free to ask or reply.

Thanks,
Chris

Aaron,



Since late last week PG&E web site started to posted with non data for some of the points.  Our solution currently is refering to previous day's data on the same point and using same values for days overlap and giving same value for new day.  Example:  on 11/01/01's captured file on California Production Injection poin twe have --


			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	      172


and on 11/02/01's captured file on California Production Injection point we have --

			11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01	11/08/01
California Pro Injection	     


when this happens, out transform code will fail and also potentially cause future loading jobs to fail because some future data is based on past data so we have to manually edited the file as follwing --

			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	      172





Until web site data is back to normal or we find better solution, this will be the solution we implement for now.  Please let me or Chris Hyde know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

I am waiting for a response to an email I sent 1 month ago regarding your
database of facilities used to generate the daily plant outage list.  I
would like to cross reference the outage information you provide with other
data from other sources and would like an efficient way to ""join"" the data.
It would be helpful to me if I had a table of plants showing your text name
and a unique ISO or WSCC identifying code.  I can be reached at 713-853-0472
for any questions regarding this request.  Thank you.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. 

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp week is Monday through Friday. 

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your sessions.   The deadline to register is Monday, May 21.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to the Energizer room in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.  Enron Campers are loaded on Coach USA Buses and transported to our nearby camp. At the end of the day campers are brought back to the Energizer for parents to check out.  

It's that easy!

We may have to request a check to pay for the information in advance, if my past experience is any indication.  What is your RC number, or would Tara be able to take care of it?  

Also, did you send this message before you finished it?  Looks like the last sentence is incomplete!  I assumed that you meant she would be my contact while you are gone.

Becky,

I was just wondering whether Questar ever got back to you regarding the historicals we requested from them.  As I understand, Lori Creer was going to check with her supervisors/management and get back with you.  I'll be out of the office Thursday and Friday.  In my absence, Tara Piazze

"URGENT:  Contact Lens Bill Needs Your Help!","Dear Matthew,

HB 1877, by Rep. Patricia Gray, has been set on the House of
Representatives Calendar for debate TODAY, Wednesday, May 09, 2001.

This bill would protect your right to choose where you purchase your
contact lenses by providing for automatic release of contact lens
prescriptions upon final fitting and allowing for a faxed copy of your
prescription, instead of requiring a hand written original.

Legislators need to hear from contact lens wearers in support of this
important bill IMMEDIATELY.

Please call your state representative's office now and let them know:
1) You are a constituent of their district.
2) You would like them to vote for HB 1877.
3) You support automatic release of contact lens prescriptions, and a faxed
copy instead of an original handwritten one because it protects your right
to choose where you buy your contact lenses.

Here is your legislator's information
Beverly Woolley
Phone: 512-463-0696

We know this is short notice, but at the end of legislative session things
change quickly.  Thank you in advance for your time and effort.

Sincerely,

Subject:	March of Dimes

Hello All--

Shelley Corman has asked me to forward the attached letter to you regarding Enron's fundraising efforts on behalf of the March of Dimes.  

Please take a moment to review--any contribution you can make would be greatly appreciated and will be matched 100% by Enron.

Please ket me know if you have any questions or need any additional information

Thanks!
  
Please make checks payable to the March of Dimes and send to me at Location EB3275F. 
 
==========================================================================================================================
Dear ENA Team Member:
 
I am proud to serve as a sponsor of Enron's March of Dimes 2001 Walk Team.   March of Dimes is a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to improve the health of babies preventing birth defects and infant mortality.  Childhood health is a cause near and dear to my heart.   
 
Obviously, it is a cause that is near and dear to Enron employees as well.  Last year our Enron team raised over $46,000.   This year our team has set a goal to raise $75,000.  With your help, I believe we can achieve this aggressive goal. 
 
I understand that you are called upon to donate your time and money to many worthy causes and clearly I am not a seasoned fundraiser.  What I can tell you is that I am proud of our employees that have rallied a grassroots effort to support March of Dimes here at Enron.  I am committed to continuing their work.  I ask that you consider making a donation in any amount.  

Please use the attached envelope to make your donation to the March of Dimes and forward you check back to me by Friday, April 27th.  Your contribution is totally tax deductible and Enron will match your gift dollar for dollar (I will take care of the matching paperwork).  
 
Thanks, in advance, for your donation and support of the March of Dimes.  You can read more about the March of Dimes at www.modimes.org.  
 
Sincerely,

Suzanne Calcagno

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock

"Leadership Committees","We are launching a number of committees to perform key functions across Enron.  Enron's breadth of activities and nonhierarchal organization make it increasingly necessary to broaden the participation of Enron's next generation of leadership in the important decisions affecting the company.  Broadening participation will result in increased access to information as decisions are made and will allow committee members to extend their working relationships and influence throughout the company.

The committee charters and memberships are set forth below.  Not everyone listed has been contacted in advance.  We urge you to serve if at all possible, but, if you cannot, please contact the committee chair.

VP PRC

The VP PRC will continue to be responsible for evaluating the performance of Enron's Vice Presidents, determining promotions to Vice President, and recommending promotions to Managing Director.  Additionally, the VP PRC will review and propose changes to the PRC process, the performance evaluation criteria and the promotion criteria.

The VP PRC will be chaired by Dave Delainey and its membership is as follows:


Tim Belden	Ben Glisan	Danny McCarty	
Michael Brown	Joe Gold	Jeff McMahon	
Rick Buy	Mark Haedicke	Rob Milnthorp	
Wes Colwell	Jim Hughes	Matthew Scrimshaw	
David Cox	Louise Kitchen	Jeff Shankman	
Janet Dietrich	Michael Kopper	Richard Shapiro	
Dave Duran	John Lavorato	Marty Sunde	
Jim Fallon	Dan Leff		



Analyst/Associate PRC

The analyst/associate PRC will be divided into 3 groups.  Enron Europe will have the same committee evaluate analysts and associates.  This group will be chaired by John Sherriff and its membership is as follows:


Pierre Aury	Kevin Heffron	Andreas Radmacher	
Rob Bayley	Joe Hirl	Stuart Rexrode	
Paul Chivers	Chris Mahoney	Marcello Romano	
Markus Fiala	Christopher McKey	Bjarne Schieldrop	
David Gallagher	Roy Poyntz	Ron Slimp

The associate PRC for the Americas will be chaired by Stan Horton and its membership is as follows:


Sally Beck 	Troy Henry	Kevin Presto 	
Jeremy Blachman	Sean Holmes 	Brad Richter 	
Don Black	Sean Long 	Stewart Seeligson	
Dan Castagnola 	Rodney Malcolm	Hunter Shively	
Joe Deffner	Scott Neal 	Jim Steffes 	
Kevin Garland	John Nowlan 	Andy Zipper 	
David Gorte	Ozzie Pagan 		



The analyst PRC for the Americas will be chaired by Steve Kean and its membership is as follows:


Federico Cerisoli 	Mark Jackson 	Everett Plante 	
Jennifer Fraser 	Ben Jacoby 	Paul Racicot 	
Derrick Davies	Steve Jernigan 	Angela Schwarz	
Scott Gahn 	Jay Lewis 	Ed Smida 	
Rod Hayslett	Cheryl Lipshutz 	Jon Thomsen 	
Rogers Herndon 	Michael Mann	Emilio Vicens 	
Brenda Herod 	Ed McMichael 	Frank Vickers 	
Kevin Howard 	Steve Meyers 		




Analyst/Associate Program

The most essential determinant of Enron's continued growth is our ability to attract and develop new talent.  The analyst/associate program has been the biggest contributor to our success in this area.  Charlene Jackson, currently leading our analyst/associate program, has taken a commercial position in EES' account management organization.  We thank Charlene for her hard work and many contributions to the program.  Going forward, this program will be administered by a committee chaired by John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe.  The members of this committee are listed below.  Billy Lemmons, currently Vice President of Enron Global Markets, will lead the day-to-day operations of the program. Billy joined Enron in 1992, and has served in a variety of commercial capacities across the company and has been an active participant in the Associate /Analyst program.  Please join us in congratulating Billy on his new responsibilities.


Phillip Allen	Andy Fastow	Eric Shaw	
Robina Barker-Bennett	Kevin Garland	Hunter Shively	
Rick Causey	Ken Rice	Stu Staley	
Joe Deffner			



Culture

We are combining the vision and values, diversity and corporate responsibility committees into a single corporate culture committee chaired by Ken Lay.  Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney and Kelly Kimberly will serve as executive directors of this committee.  This committee will focus on leadership and work-life issues (making it easier to attract and retain the best talent), in addition to continuing the work of the vision and values, diversity and corporate responsibility task forces.  The members of this committee are as follows:


Greg Adams	Louise Kitchen	Mark Palmer	
Shelley Corman	Michael Kopper	Paula Rieker	
Janet Dietrich	Richard Lewis	Jeff Shankman	
Jeff Donahue	Sean Long	Mitch Taylor	
Gene Humphrey	Dan McCarty	Mike Terraso	
Robert Jones	Jean Mrha		


The Corporate Policy Committee will conduct the MD PRC and review the recommendations of the other committees, giving substantial deference to the decisions of those other committees.  We will be forming other committees to deal with other significant functions, tasks and issues facing the company.

"Travelocity.com fare watcher update","Thursday, May 31, 2001

Dear MATHEW,

Travelocity's Fare Watcher, your ultimate tool for keeping on top of
rapidly changing air fares, found fare changes in 2 of the markets
you are watching.  When you review the airfares below, remember that
fares change rapidly!  Low fares sell out quickly, and the sooner you
check, the more likely you are to find available seats.

Have your travel needs changed? Are you looking to go someplace new?
Remember to update your Fare Watcher subscription so that you're
always notified when fares change to your favorite destinations.

To find one of the fares below, point your web browser to your
Personal Fare Watcher Page on Travelocity by clicking on the

"hello","All,

As many of you already know, I decided to take a position at EES, so this week suppose to be my last week in the Gas Fundamentals Group.
It is a pretty satisfactory feeling to the reporting team and myself that we are able to contribute to the success of gas trading by providing over
100 reports every day. I certainly appreciated all your help, cooperation and friendship. Needless to say it was a great experience to work with 
you all. 

At Dave Dronet's request I'll stay one more week to transit my responsibilities to Kim Alexsander next week. Kim will lead the reporting team
and continue provide the excellent support to you all. The reporting team is in good hands. Even after I move to another group,
I am just a phone call away, I'll let you know my new phone # and continue to help you wherever I can. 

Thanks....

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

The IHS DRN's are identified in red below.  Please make one up for the 608 Novelty Hill M/S point.  Thanks.

Subject:	Northwest Foreign Key Problems

Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key violations as well.  These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key violation):

458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR - 3553
611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001) - 37032
608 NOVELTY HILL M/S - (mkup one)
612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001) - 2603


If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be great.  If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.

Thanks,
Chris

Hey!  Got your message.  Thanks for letting me know you got in safely.  Did 
you really not wake me up because you thought I would rather sleep or did 
you come upstairs to find naked people?  I wondered that when I woke up and 
realised you had gone! :) Ooops!

Anyway, what a great night!  Very annoying that the others bailed, but a 
great time none-the-less.  I never realised how many cocktails I had 
consumed, until I woke up the next morning still feeling drunk. Wowe!

So, about Utah....what was the company you found the cheapy tickets at?  
Jeff is getting back to me this week with mountains and clubs and all that 
jazz.  I'll ask him what he recommends about lodging.  We'll be out and 
about so much that I think a B&B or a hotel would do.  If we were staying 
for longer and with a group of people I might look into phat little pads.  
Have you found a Sundance schedule? Are you still thinking the 17th-21st??   
  Can't Wait!!  Kristen

Free Opera in the Park featuring Houston Grand Opera's Carmen, June 8-10!
Houston Grand Opera's sensational Multimedia Modular Stage production returns for three FREE performances at Houston's Miller Outdoor Theatre on June 8-10 at 8:30 p.m. Bizet's fiery gypsy Carmen, everybody's favorite femme fatale, ignites the summer in a powerhouse production that had audiences and critics cheering when it was first unveiled in 1998.

Houston Grand Opera's revolutionary Multimedia Modular Stage (MMS), with its giant ""live"" video screens, hydraulic platforms, and hundreds of rotating, colored lights takes the incredible energy onstage and transports it to the farthest reaches of the outdoor venue with a visceral impact equal to that of a rock concert!

Tickets for the reserved seating will be issued between the hours of 11:30am and 1:00pm through the Miller Theatre box office on the day of the performance.  Any remaining tickets will be issued one hour before the performance.

"Monthly Avg and MDT Avg on 1st day of each month","Guys,

Some of you have noticed that on many of today's reports, we are able to see flow value for a meter for 5/1/2000, but the MDT column showed
""na"" on the daily report. ""na"" is also shown on the historical report for the average of May.  It is very easy to get confused (at least I was in the beginnieng, even 
though I wrote the program myself) when you see things like this, you may ask why isn't the average the value shown for today since there is 
only one day's data? The answer is that they are from different cycles. Coding used the business logic that grab the flow value from the latest
successful cycle,  while always use the last cycle when deal with average. At the time of report generation if the last cycle is not available, this will
happen. Fortunately this only happens on the first day of each month.

Please explain this to those who may raise this question when they see this ""discrepancy"".

Have not heard anything, and I've haven't had a chance to get back with her.  Since I didn't talk to her until late Monday, I didn't really expect to hear from her yesterday anyway.  I will follow up as soon as I get a chance.

We may have to request a check to pay for the information in advance, if my past experience is any indication.  What is your RC number, or would Tara be able to take care of it?  

Also, did you send this message before you finished it?  Looks like the last sentence is incomplete!  I assumed that you meant she would be my contact while you are gone.

Kam,

Hey, there's a nymex sale of 5000 /day Dec at 2.945 that shows up as a changed deal in my P&L from last night.  The deal is a valid sale that I executed, but it does not appear to be valued correctly.  It's valued at $3,096 when nymex was marked at 2.735 so the value should have been $32,550.  I would contact Ashley directly, but I don't know her last name.  Thanks.

Mat

"Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition","
After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. 

To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our ""Ode to Why"" commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the ""Leading Company in the World.""

All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit home.enron.com.

"Questar/Overthrust etc. Issues this weekend","First of all, don't ask me why I'm still up at this hour, 'cause even I don't know...but since I am, I guess I can be accomplishing something constructive, so here goes:
 
Questar appears to have returned to normal.  Their data is now up to date, and I have re-enabled all of the jobs.  Hopefully things are back to normal for them...
 
Overthrust appears to be back up, albeit at a slightly different URL ( they moved from:
<http://152.137.64.16/cgi-bin/r30cgi32.exe?piprodit>
to
<http://152.137.64.16/cgi-bin/rwcgi60.exe?piprodit> ).
 
A slight change, but enough to affect us (if ONE character changes in the URL, it affects us).  So, I have modified the capture jobs for Overthrust to use this new URL...hopefully they also have stabilized.
 
Now, there is still data that has been missed for these pipes...we should look into possible recovery at the earliest convenience.
 
Anyway, just wanted to give everyone a heads-up of the happenings...
 
Thanks,
Chris

I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock

"KNE web site problems","Just as a heads up...

The web site that serves data for Kinder Morgan, Transcolorado, NGPL, etc. is having issues as I write this.  The following message comes up when trying to receive point data:

An error occurred while executing the page. Please use the ""Back"" button on your browser to try again, or try again at a later time. If the problem persists, please contact ApplicationName Support (user@kne.com). 
The error message is:
[INTERSOLV][ODBC SQL Server driver][SQL Server]ct_results(): user api layer: internal Client Library error: Read from the server has timed out.

Basically, this means their server currently has issues.  I just wanted to send this out as a heads up that we could potentially miss some cycle information for the morning reports.  Hopefully, the site will stabilize before then.

"Greetings","
Matt,
 
Long time no  hear, hope you're doing fine at the new company. Sorry to bother you  with this issue again since I know Leo Sommaripa has contacted you  already, so I'll be brief and to the point. 
 
We have been  trying to save a copy of the Database on a CD-R so that we can give it to the  client for their reference but some issues have come up which have to do with  programming. Our intention is for the client to keep the database in the CD and  to be able to access all the features in it so that there is no need for them to  copy it unto a hard drive and possibly modify the data.  Since by saving it unto a CD makes the database  read-only, there's no problem with keeping the data on the disk intact, and  we're even working on a disclaimer to paste on the database.  
 
The problem is  that by making it into a read-only file, some commands have become disabled.  Specifically, the buttons on the review form that access the compliance,  operations, equipment, and staffing forms are not available through the  read-only format. I ventured into the programming codes for the commands and  found the following string on all four buttons:
 
DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acRecordsMenu,  acSaveRecord, , acMenuVer70
 
I temporarily  deleted that line from the programming codes for all four and so far have not  had any problems with accessing all levels of the database in the CD. Now, I do  not know exactly what that string does to the database but would much rather  find a safer alternative if possible or at least know that the string is  not a critical part of the process. If this is something that can be answered  right off the bat I'd appreciate it, I realize that this is not a priority  anymore so if its something that will consume  a extended period of time,  let me know and I will continue seraching through other  channels.
 
I guess this  wasn't brief after all and I appreciate the time and effort. I can be  emailed or I can make the arrangements to call you, whatever's better for  you.

Chris,

Remember way back when......we threw out a bunch of PGE (#17) data that we were going to reload from the saved html files?  Anyway, it looks like we're missing data from 2/7/01 through 3/12/01.  As we discussed, we should have the html files so can we run those through the transform and get them into the database?  Let me know if there are any issues.

Are you using regionID = 2?  That corresponds to Calif.  If you are using regionID 5, 6, or 7 (NP, SP, and ZP), then you are probably not getting any results.  We do not break up the Calif forecast into NP/SP/ZP.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

Subject: Questar


As per our discussion, I have done the following to fix the issues with Questar data:

-  dumped data from 02/04/2001 -> present, for all cycles
-  fixed the transform component to pull the proper column for utilized capacity and also to assign the correct effective date for each value
-  re-transformed and re-loaded ALL cycle 5 data (from the *htm files we have)

Now, in loading the 86 or so days back into the DB, approx. 3603 PRIMARY KEY violations were logged...this means that they are duplicating point data within the same day, same cycle, etc.  If this data could be examined more closely in the reports that are subsequently generated, we can make sure that things are truly copacetic from our side (a ""surface"" scan of the *.htm files shows that they are indeed duplicating points, usually with different names...the utilized capacity associated with these points is the same though, so this doesn't appear to be a big issue, except for the fact that we will continue to have primary key violations being logged).

As always, any questions, just ask.

Thanks,
Chris

"Enron Announcement","Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

"RE: issue with report generation issue","
All:

Just as a follow up to the mail I sent yesterday, what I found out this morning is that all reports generation based on 
the 1st cub processing are successful, after I moved the cube processing time back to 2:30 AM. This probably tells
us that we need to leave enough time between the last scraping  and the cube processing, although what caused 
the blow-up yesterday is still mysterious. The lesson is when it is working, do not make changes, or it may break.  

There are still a  few format issues I need to fix.

Cc:	Alexander, Kim D; Hylton, Angela; Chiu, Lindon
Subject:	issue with report generation issue

All:

As you all noticed that on many of our morning reports today ""NA"" were put there as today's data,
that means at the time those reports were generated today's data were not in the cube, so the report
engine put ""NA"" there. However, by looking at the Retrieved_DTM field in the Meter_Usage_Stat
table in our database it showed that the scrapings were successful for all west pipelines as of 
11 PM last night. When I checked the history log of cube processing, the cube were processed  
successfully both times at 11:59 PM last night and 6:30 AM this morning, respectively.

We process cube twice in the morning, the purpose of second processing is to grab those manual entry data.
Reports generated after second processing (CIG_WIC, SoCal, and Rockies Production) were all successful.
Only those reports generated after first processing are problematic. So only two possibilities I can thick of can
explain this: 1) Although processing log showed success, it did not actually grab newly entered data to the cube with 
the first procssing. 2) Those data were not in the database table at the time of first processing.

I believe the true reason has to be one of the above. But my investigation so far can not give me any clue as what
could have caused one of above. Because if 1) was true, we'll need ask Microsoft on the consistency of cube processing,
cube processing has never failed us before. If 2) was true, it could not explain why in the Retrieved_DTM column of
Meter_Usage_Stat table showed us that before the first processing the data were already in the database.


My intention to move the first processing time from 2:30 AM to 11:59 PM was to have more time between the two processing 
to take care of the growing number of reports we are generating. I thought 1 hour difference between the last scraping and 
cube processing should be enough. That was the only change I made last week and we had not experience such a problem 
before this change. 

So without knowing the true cause of the problem, what I am going to do is to move the 1st cube processing
time back to 2:30 AM to see if it corrects the problem. I'll try to be here early tomorrow morning to make sure 
all the reports run fine.

I welcome your suggestions and comments on the possible cause of the problem to suggestions on how to prevent this from
happening again.

Thanks


Yan x33228

Jaguar service was trurned off accidentally last night at about 5:00 pm.  It was turned back on this morining at about 7:50 am.  I checked all the job in DB and files in server folder and appear that all the data has been captured.  But we still need to verify cycle 1 and 2 for some of the sites because they may be the same.

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Enron fires two employees linked to partnerships

    NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. <ENE.N>, the
embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer
and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of
its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by
U.S. regulators.
    Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan,
managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina
Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division.
    Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with
four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in
a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with
Enron.
   Shares of Enron were trading down 5 cents or .55 percent at
$9 on the New York Stock Exchange.

"Socal Window Meeting","Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

  Could you also please forward this email on to Ted.  I forgot to copy him 
on my email last time that gave my forwarding info and I don't recall his 
last name.  He is planning to be in park city with some friends this winter 
and wanted to get in touch w/ me.
Let me know if you have any questions regarding park city.  I think the 
parkcity info website has some info on Sundance, you just have to dig 
through there to find it.
Take care,

Do you have VB6 installed on your machine? If you have I can show you a few lines to do an experiment to see if SendKeys work with your program at all. If not, please come to my desk after 2pm.

Per our conversation yesterday, I'd like to test the send key process for obtaining the Socal hourly storage postings.  Once I get the scheduling system opened and set, the following is the keystrokes required:


Enter
Alt-F
P
Enter
Enter

Of course, a slight pause between the keystokes might be needed.  And if we need to maintain activity to keep the system from kicking us out, we can simply use two Enter keystrokes.  Please let me know when you'll be able to give this a shot.

Thanks.

"RE: Questar historicals -- MORE","She just called me back and said they haven't been able to figure out how to bill for the fee yet, but her supervisor told her to go ahead and start pulling the info together.  She thinks she might have something towards the end of the week, and I asked her to let me know for sure on the timing.  One thing -- they haven't closed May yet, so it may take a little longer to get than the previous months.

Have not heard anything, and I've haven't had a chance to get back with her.  Since I didn't talk to her until late Monday, I didn't really expect to hear from her yesterday anyway.  I will follow up as soon as I get a chance.

We may have to request a check to pay for the information in advance, if my past experience is any indication.  What is your RC number, or would Tara be able to take care of it?  

Also, did you send this message before you finished it?  Looks like the last sentence is incomplete!  I assumed that you meant she would be my contact while you are gone.

I was just wondering whether Questar ever got back to you regarding the historicals we requested from them.  As I understand, Lori Creer was going to check with her supervisors/management and get back with you.  I'll be out of the office Thursday and Friday.  In my absence, Tara Piazze

I see now in Sitara that you booked it to ENA-IM WC CAL.  Should I change it to that in TAGG?

Ashley,

There's a changed deal in my book with Counterparty City of Pasadena.  I believe I originally input the deal to go to Mike's book, which is the correct book.  It appears that maybe you changed it thinking it was a mistake.  ??

"Hey there","Hey Mat - I haven't heard from you since we played phone tag about a month
ago.  Wanted to let you know that I have a trip coming up next week and I'll
be passing through IAH Wednesday night around 9:00.  Right now my layover is
for only 50 minutes but I may be able to catch an earlier connection out of
Denver if you're going to be around that night.  If you're around I'll call
your cell on Wednesday as I'm leaving Denver & let you know if I catch the
earlier connection and maybe you can meet me at the airport for a drink.
Anyway, let me know what your plans are.

Other than being totally swamped here at work things are good.  Matt & I see
each other about once a month and we're going to Alaska for two weeks at the
beginning of August.  Let me know how things are with you.

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Mat,

Do you have VB6 installed on your machine? If you have I can show you a few lines to do an experiment to see if SendKeys work with your program at all. If not, please come to my desk after 2pm.

Per our conversation yesterday, I'd like to test the send key process for obtaining the Socal hourly storage postings.  Once I get the scheduling system opened and set, the following is the keystrokes required:


Enter
Alt-F
P
Enter
Enter

Of course, a slight pause between the keystokes might be needed.  And if we need to maintain activity to keep the system from kicking us out, we can simply use two Enter keystrokes.  Please let me know when you'll be able to give this a shot.

Thanks.

"iBuyit Payables Is Now Available","
 

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved (again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at (713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at (713) 853-7127
 or toll free at (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to iBuyit.payables@enron.com <mailto:iBuyit.payables@enron.com>.

Questions?
For general information about iBuyit, send an e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>.

I came upon Hotwire, tried it, and by golly, imagine my shock and joyous surprise when they had the fare for $153! And this was no puddle-jumper, but a major carrier. Then I got a full-size car in the same market for less ($30/day) than what I could get a compact car for ($50/day) on my own. I'm sold, and have told all my friends and family about the great deals on Hotwire! Thanks, Hotwire.""  K.L. Jourdanton, TX  Got a Hotwire story? Email us at TheHotwire@hotwire.com .

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

"Holiday travel tips from Northwest Airlines","
Dear Traveler: 

As the busy holiday travel season begins, Northwest Airlines 
looks forward to welcoming you onboard our flights and wishes 
you a pleasant travel experience. We remind all travelers that 
extra security procedures are in place at all airports and 
we request your continued cooperation with these new requirements.   
Please consider the following travel tips as you prepare for 
your flights.

Allow for extra time at the airport.  Domestic travelers should 
arrive at the airport 75 minutes prior to departure. International 
travelers should arrive 2 hours in advance. 

Bring photo identification with you. All passengers age 18 and 
older must carry government-issued photo identification at all 
times and may be asked to show identification at check-in 
and during boarding. 

Avoid wrapping your holiday gifts prior to travel.  Due to the 
heightened airport security measures and the random and thorough 
nature of security searches, travelers should not bring wrapped 
packages on-board the aircraft. Please include your unwrapped 
gifts or packages with your checked luggage or ship your packages 
in advance of your departure.

Additionally, certain items cannot be carried onboard the aircraft 
and will not be allowed beyond security checkpoints. These items 
include knives/cutting instruments, all ""non-safety"" type razor 
blades, corkscrews, baseball bats, golf clubs, ski poles and hockey 
sticks.  If you do need these items, please plan to check them 
with your luggage. 

Northwest offers several convenient self-service check-in options 
to help speed your way through the airport.  E-Ticket customers 
may check in online from their home or office with nwa.com Check-In 
or use an E-Service Center located at most major airports in the U.S.  
WorldClubs members may continue to check-in at the club, but will 
need proper documentation to pass through security as noted below.  
Customers may also check-in at the airport check-in counters or 
at one of our many curbside check-in locations.  If you have proper 
ticket documentation and no luggage to check, you may proceed directly 
to your departure gate. 

As a final reminder, all passengers will need one of the following 
to pass through security checkpoints at the airport: 
- A receipt for an electronic ticket - including ticket number
- An itinerary generated by an airline or a travel agency confirming 
an electronic ticket - including ticket number
- Boarding Pass 
- A paper ticket

For more information about these travel tips or to view your current 
travel reservations, please visit us online at http://www.nwa.com.

We thank you again for choosing Northwest Airlines and we wish you a 
happy holiday season.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"P&L estimates","Good morning,

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,
Kam

"Questar","As per our discussion, I have done the following to fix the issues with Questar data:

-  dumped data from 02/04/2001 -> present, for all cycles
-  fixed the transform component to pull the proper column for utilized capacity and also to assign the correct effective date for each value
-  re-transformed and re-loaded ALL cycle 5 data (from the *htm files we have)

Now, in loading the 86 or so days back into the DB, approx. 3603 PRIMARY KEY violations were logged...this means that they are duplicating point data within the same day, same cycle, etc.  If this data could be examined more closely in the reports that are subsequently generated, we can make sure that things are truly copacetic from our side (a ""surface"" scan of the *.htm files shows that they are indeed duplicating points, usually with different names...the utilized capacity associated with these points is the same though, so this doesn't appear to be a big issue, except for the fact that we will continue to have primary key violations being logged).

As always, any questions, just ask.

Thanks,
Chris

"Harvesting Issues on 05/19/2001","We appeared to have some problems with a couple of web sites on Saturday
evening / Sunday afternoon.  Unfortunately, I was not home at that time to
be able to reset them.  Upon returning home this evening (Sunday), I took a
look and the following cycles did not get scraped:

05/19/2001
Kern, Cycles 2 & 4
Transco Cycle 2

05/20/2001
KM (Points R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
Transcolorado (R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
Kern, Cycle 3
Northwest, Cycle 6

I have reset all of the jobs...unfortunately, I suspect there is data loss
for the above cycles. One of our ""old friends"", the 1line Williams site, is
definately the cause for the Northwest, Kern and Transco misses.  This site
still appears to be having problems, so it should be checked for the next
couple of days.  When trying to go to it tonight, I received various errors,
and the general site layout appeared different since the last time I looked
(this means they could potentially change the layout of the page we get data
from as well).

As I write this, ""capture"" jobs for Kern, Northwest, and Transco are failing
due to ""Internal Server Errors"".

Hopefully, this is a short-term problem, and these sites will stabilize
soon.  The bright side of this story is that the Jaguar system did exactly
what it was supposed to do when these problems occur...it retried until the
job attempts seemed fruitless, then it sent pages to report the problems.

"Internet E-mail","
In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at
the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Subject:  Sat night - the plan

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.

Eddie,

We'll need a new pipeline for Northwest manual entry.  The point should have DRN JPINV, but no corresponding IHS DRN.  Please populate the database with a value of 16,460,301 with flow type S for 6/2/2001.  We will manually enter this point until we can automate it.

"trips, chixs and other fancy things","Hey Matteo,

How's everything goin?  SO, I am so pumped about Utah.  I talked with my 
friend Jeff and he told me so much more about Park City, skiing there, where 
to go, the night life and the Sundance Festival.  He is going to write up a 
bunch of stuff for us and would like to meet up with us for a day or two as 
well.  We are planning on Martin Luther King weekend still??

I was thinking that maybe Brad and Heather might like to go as well.  Sent 
out the invite to a few people, will know more by the end of the week.  I 
say let's get the tickets and start planning.  Once I get the specifics on 
ski places from Jeff, I'll have a better idea of where would be the best 
place to crash.  By then maybe we will have a few more people commited and 
can make a decision.  Sweet!

Also, last night I brought up the idea (to Duncan) of going to Australia in 
February for a few weeks.  I know that you and Jeff have been thinking about 
it.  Just thought I would let you know that we are too.

So, how did your weekend go with the chica????   love, k

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

"RE: Socal Hourly Storage Capture","Mat,

Do you have VB6 installed on your machine? If you have I can show you a few lines to do an experiment to see if SendKeys work with your program at all. If not, please come to my desk after 2pm.

Per our conversation yesterday, I'd like to test the send key process for obtaining the Socal hourly storage postings.  Once I get the scheduling system opened and set, the following is the keystrokes required:


Enter
Alt-F
P
Enter
Enter

Of course, a slight pause between the keystokes might be needed.  And if we need to maintain activity to keep the system from kicking us out, we can simply use two Enter keystrokes.  Please let me know when you'll be able to give this a shot.

Thanks.

"Houston Ballet's Miller Theater Performance of Coppelia","
Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp?lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp?lia  tells the story of a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric toymaker Dr. Copp?lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp?lia to the people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: ""Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue.""
Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in 	the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

"Log and others","Guys,

I am really glad that the report generations were working fine during the period when I was away, 
thanks to the efforts of Kim, Lindon and Angela. But I am so sad that you don't have to have me around anymore for your reports ...

Hereby I'd like to give you an update on a few issues we fixed/fixing.
	a) Code has been added to show the Storage balance in the historical report instead of average
	b) Because OLAP cube interprets Null as 0 value, we saw monthly average to be 0 but actually should be Null,
	we've added code to detect Null value so that ""NA"" will be shown for monthly average rather than 0.
	c) Some pipeline (e.g. PGE) broadcast forward (future) flow, so in the end of the month, the latest month in Time
	dimension of the cube does not indicate the correct one. For instance, today is May. 31, the latest month in Time
	dimension is already June, which cause problems in historical report. It has been fixed.
	e) Central historical reports have been made fit to one page, and extra sheets on the interactive ones have been removed.

Matt: In order for the above items to take effect please verify with the executable Kim give you and let us know so that we can use it to replace
the one currently used for report generation. 

Another thing I talked with Matt was the Maximum Capacity column. I understand that you'd like to remove that column for reports which do
not report this value, however it involves big structure change to take one column away. I am wondering if we can put ""NA"" or use some other wording
such as ""not reported"" instead to save coding time and structure change. I need your feedback on this. 

One last item is that I checked the log for both daily and historical report and noticed that there are still quite some points their report setting are not quite
right. Please take a look at the attached, if it is a report you are responsible, make sure the settings are right so we don't see error in the log.

Thanks, I'll try to write short email next time.

There was a problem with your book on Friday night.  The IT group did not have it ready to calculate so I was unable to report it.  They will have this done today and I will then load your positions into TDS.  As of Friday you were short 30 NYMEX contracts in Dec-01.

"FW: interview schedule for AIESEC interns","I had to move the AIESEC intern interviews to this afternoon due to the group meetings that were scheduled for yesterday afternoon.  Since the group meetings are now scheduled for today and I do not want to move the interviews again, you will be conducting the interviews and making recomendations on who to hire.  Here is the schedule:

All three of us will interview Milen and Grzegorz at 2:00 and 2:30.
Tara & Mat will interview Mohit and Guilherme at 3:00 and 3:30.
All three of us will interview Jenny on Thursday at 2:30.

Make sure their English and technical (Excel/Database) skill are sufficient.  If you would like, we can talk briefly about what to ask the candidates.  We will meet Thursday afternoon to make a decision.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"California real-time graphs","As some of you may know, I have been working with Lindon Chiu of the IT department to generate real time, hourly graphs for various California data (load, imports, temperature).  We now have the preliminary graphs, and they can be accessed at:

 http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/main.asp (not the same link as the main fundamentals page)
(click on ""Gas"", ""Testing"", and then ""Load and Temperature Charts"")

These are the premilinary graphs which pull data from the Portland West Power database, so they will include only the data available in the Portland tables .  The finalized versions will actually scrape the various data straight from their original souces (Cal ISO website, Bonneville website), which will make them more reliable.

Please look at the graphs, and tell me what changes you would like, if any.  I will pass them along to Lindon before he starts work on the finalized graphs, which will eventually be included in the ""Integrative Reporting System"" for the entire floor.

Also, please forward to anyone else you think would be interested in these graphs.

As a reminder, the WSCC outages graphs can still be accessed at the main fundamentals webpage under ""Gas"", ""Testing"", ""WSCC Outages"".  

Please e-mail me with any questions or concerns.  Thank you!

Chris,

I think we need a new pipeline for El Paso Manual Entry.  We need to enter linepack once a day.  Let's call the DRN LinePack and populate with flow type S.  Thanks.

"RE:","I just remembered something funny that happened on the bus this morning.
Remember the guy who I told you about, the one who gets excited when I get
on the bus.  Anyways, this morning he was staring at me as usual, and
instead of looking away, I smiled at him.  So when he got up to get off, he
asks me if I like cinnamon rolls.  I said no. And he said I will bring you
some tomorrow and then I said awesome.  Now, I have to take the earlier bus
so I won't have to see him.  This girl who I am friends with was sitting
next to me during the interaction and it was pretty funny.
ok, that is it.

So, this Friday is my 27th (YIKES!!) birthday.  I plan on going over to Little Woodrows (by Brazos and Hadley) around 5:00 to celebrate.  Please come and help me forget that I'm that much closer to 30.  (No, Massimo, I'm not going to do 27 shots!)
Not sure what the plan is after Little Woodrows, but we'll go from there.
Feel free to invite anyone else I may have left off the list.
Hope to see you then!

"","The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Regency garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Just wanted to let you know that i'm having some flowers delivered to
the house tomorrow (Sat) for Mother's day.  They couldn't give me a
time, though.  I told them to leave them on the porch if noone is home.

Also, I just got invited to play golf at TPC, which if you don't know,
is the venue for the Houston Shell Open.  A round costs at least $100,
but free for me.  I better get to the range tomorrow.  Unfortunately
every muscle in my body aches from working out and today we did arms, so
i'm really in trouble.  Oh well.....

Talk to you soon.

Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed.

Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999.

We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.

Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphanage children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. 

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp week is Monday through Friday. 

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your sessions.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to the Energizer room in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.  Enron Campers are loaded on Coach USA Buses and transported to our nearby camp. At the end of the day campers are brought back to the Energizer for parents to check out.  

It's that easy!

Chris,

I am working with Julia Gomez and Barry Tycholiz on a fundamentals presentation.  One of the things I am after is pipeline load factor data for points into California, the Pacific Northwest and from the Rockies, San Juan, and Permian basins.  

Where can I find historical monthly information (i.e. going back at least a couple of years) for this data?  I have copies of the sheets that Tara puts out, but ideally the data would be in excel format.  I know that you have converted a lot of the old spreadsheets to a new pdf format.

Let me know.

Thanks,

As Rebecca Cantrell discussed.  You will likely see an invoice from Questar for charges related to this data request.

See, bad stuff.



Enron fires two employees linked to partnerships

    NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. <ENE.N>, the
embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer
and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of
its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by
U.S. regulators.
    Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan,
managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina
Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division.
    Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with
four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in
a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with
Enron.
   Shares of Enron were trading down 5 cents or .55 percent at
$9 on the New York Stock Exchange.

sorry for being such a bum by not keeping in touch.  i've been VERY stressed
recently.  i have pretty much avoided all communication with anyone and
locked myself indoors.  and, (you'll find this hard to believe), i haven't
even been going out!  i am really nervous about my exam, so i've just been
trying to concentrate on studying.  after my exam (2 weeks from wednesday),
 i will be SO ready to party.  i promise i'll get in touch afterwards.
until then, i am going to continue my seclusion...

see ya,

"RE: Hey there","Unfortunately for this particular trip there is no flexibility in my
schedule.  The company is usually very good about this kind of stuff, but
we're in a crunch on this and many projects so it's just get out and get
back.  It looks like the best I can do getting an earlier flight is to be in
IAH by 7:55 with my flight to B'Ham at 9:55.  We'd have to get dinner at the
airport unfortunately, but it's better than nothing.  I'll call you
Wednesday and let you know what's happening.

Becky,

Well, today things suck, but overall everything is great.  I lost about
$100,000 this morning because I'm an idiot, but it's not completely my
fault.  Anyway, you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go
to dinner or something.  Too bad it's not at the end of week so you could
stay over, even though if you wanted to, you could.  I could leave work
pretty much anytime on wednesday, so just let me know.  If you don't have
my work number, its 713-853-0472.  Thanks.

   Hey Mat - I haven't heard from you since we played phone tag about a
   month
   ago.  Wanted to let you know that I have a trip coming up next week and
   I'll
   be passing through IAH Wednesday night around 9:00.  Right now my
   layover is
   for only 50 minutes but I may be able to catch an earlier connection out
   of
   Denver if you're going to be around that night.  If you're around I'll
   call
   your cell on Wednesday as I'm leaving Denver & let you know if I catch
   the
   earlier connection and maybe you can meet me at the airport for a drink.
   Anyway, let me know what your plans are.

   Other than being totally swamped here at work things are good.  Matt & I
   see
   each other about once a month and we're going to Alaska for two weeks at
   the
   beginning of August.  Let me know how things are with you.

Your new cash books are being set up ASAP.  They tell me they will be ready no later than tomorrow.
Once those are set-up, Stephanie Sever will email you your new EOL id's.

"Annual get together","Hello!!!!!  I haven't heard much from either of you concerning what we'd
like to do this year.  I have zero vacation since Matt & I are going to
Alaska in August for 2 weeks.  It's not Jazz Fest, but I wanted to let you
know that we have 2 good events coming up in B'Ham next month.

1.  May 12 - Crawfish Boil.  Annual event to raise money for charity.  Entry
fee: asked $5 donation.  Bands, good food, beer.  Options to spread a
blanket or bring a chair or just wander around and stand in front of stages
(2 to choose from).  See link below for more info.
http://www.crawfishboil.org/ <http://www.crawfishboil.org/>

2.  May 18-20 - City Stages.  This is our annual music festival.  Other
cities (Atlanta, Chattanooga, etc.) have patterned their events from this
one that's been going on for over 20 years.  I've been once and it was fun -
multiple stages - not Jazz Fest caliber, but what is?  Tickets are $20/day
or $35-40/weekend pass.  Again, food, beers, etc.  See link below for more
info.
http://www.citystages.org/ <http://www.citystages.org/>

Just wanted to put the offer out there to see if you guys were interested.
Obviously, we'd work it out so that whoever came could stay at my house (I
figure I can sleep ~10).  Let me know if you're interested or if you've
found anything else we might want to look into.

"A light at the end of the tunnel?","The completion of the identified scrapable East Desk pipes is in site (pun intended :-)...there are only a few outstanding issues remaining.  The pipes in question are:

-  National Fuel and Gas
	This site does a bit of checking to verify how you get to them...basically, it appears they make sure you come to them from a source they trust.  Attempts to work around this have so far failed, so Tara has placed a call to them directly to try and get a resolution to this problem.

-  TCO
	We have discovered a work-around for the strange Javascript issues of this site, but now have discovered that this alternative way to access the data does not necessarily report as much as the original.  Sabina is looking into this, contacting the pipeline themself for help.

-  CGT
	This is a ""sister"" pipe of TCO, and thus has the same Javascript issues.  We have also found a way around this, but Eddie is not completely certain the data is the same.  I'm going to work with him this afternoon to see if together we can figure it out.  It may be that CGT has the same problem as TCO (not as much data reported in the alternate method).

And that's it!!  TETCO has been finished today, and Iroquois has been set up as a manual entry pipe.  So, from what we can see, finishing the above 3 pipes finishes off the everything identified thus far for the East Desk.

Now, my only question is ...who's bringing the keg in on Friday?!? ;-)

As always, any questions, just ask.

Thanks,
Chris

as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

"trader joke","

A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in
front of his
office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he
got out, a
truck passed too close and completely tore off the
door on the
driver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cell
phone, dialed
911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.

Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions,
the energy trading icon
started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he
had just picked
up the day before, was now completely ruined and would
never be the
same, no matter what the body shop did to it.

When he finally wound down from his ranting
and raving, the
officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. ""I
can't believe how
materialistic you energy traders are,"" he said. ""You are so
focused on your
possessions that you don't notice anything else.""

""How can you say such a thing?"" asked the trader.

The cop replied, ""Don't you know that your left arm is
missing from
the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the
truck hit you.""

""My God!"" screamed the master trader. ""Where's my Rolex?""

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock

Tara,

It appears that from December 1999 back (although I haven't checked everything), Kern historicals were loaded improperly (wrong column from the website).  So, another major action item will be to reload those actuals.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Chris, 

Please add the following new point to the database for PGT (#15) and make sure we begin to scape it along with the others:

This is a scraped point currently being posted.  This DRN is the same as the IHS DRN for this point.

This morning the service has been restarted, and data has been recovered.  This should be examined closely, as there is the possibility that information is the same for cycles 1 and 2 of certain pipes (this may or may not be an issue...if it is, please advise us on what should be done).

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

"RE: Questar Historicals","Matt,
   It looks like Enron has only one active contract on QPC.  That is a release capacity contract from Chalk Creek to the Wasatch Front.  I can provide daily data on that point for the period during which the contract is effective if you would like.

Because we do not offer the other data you  have requested to all shippers on the pipeline, I can not respond fully to your request for historical data on all or most points on the pipeline.

Once again I would suggest that you refer to our website (www.questarpipeline.com) to begin gathering the information you need from this point forward.  I would be happy to answer any questions  you may have regarding data posted on the web site

   I discussed your request with my supervisor and we are happy to provide
   you with the dialy use reports that you've requested for the points
   where you  actively move gas.  We do not have the resources at this time
   to provide data for all points on our system.  If you can give me a list
   of specific points I can get those for you by tomorrow afternoon.  I
   would suggest that you refer to our web site for other data.  Pipeviewer
   posts daily billing estimates for all meters and up to 30 days history
   for those meters.

   Lori,

   Can you please give me an estimate of when you can provide the requested
   historical flows we discussed yesterday.  I'm trying to manage a number
   of tasks that depend on this data,. and it would be helpful to know when
   it might be available.  Thank you.

"Introducing the SAP Office Connector!","View your SAP Inbox directly in Outlook! Introducing the SAP Office Connector! 
The SAP Office Connector is a piece of software that seamlessly displays your SAP Office folders as Outlook folders. You already have the SAP Office Connector if you have the new SAPGUI 4.6D installed. If you are an SAP user, there are several reasons why you might receive an SAP Office message: 
?	You are the agent for an SAP workflow item 
?	An error has occurred for which you are the person responsible 
?	Someone (or some process) just sent you SAP mail
You can launch attached links to SAP transactions directly from Outlook, including workflow tasks!
Use of the SAP Office Connector is optional. If you use SAP only to enter your timesheet information, you probably won't get much mail in your SAP Inbox - and so probably won't benefit from using this product.
In most cases, it will make sense to use the SAP Office Connector to view your SAP notifications INSTEAD of forwarding them out of SAP to your Enron Internet mail address.  If you have configured your SAP Office to forward your mail, you should delete the forwarding when you enable the MAPI Connector.  See the attached document for more details on forwarding.
NOTE: there are several SAP systems, including Apollo Production (FI) and HR Production. You (may) have a separate set of SAP Office folders in each system. Repeat the setup steps in the attachment for EACH SAP system you want to be displayed as folders in Outlook.

"West Desk Power Loads","Jason (et al):

We are approaching somewhat of a slow-down in active harvesting development, and therefore it is a prime opportunity to begin hashing out what is required to gather the West Power load data you have previously mentioned.  We should get together personally to better organize this initiative, but some things to ""prime the pump"" are:

1)  What are the requisite sites involved?  (URLs, etc)
2)  What is the frequency of ""jobs""?  (how often do we scrape the data; once a day, x number of time a day, etc).
3)  What is the nature of the data we are scraping?  (this will help us to determine if we already have a database schema that this will fit into, or if we need to extend/develop one)

These are just some topics to get us started...you may have already answered some/all of these previously, but I feel they deserve mentioning again, if for no other reason than to make sure we are all on the same page moving forward.

Please reply with your availability over the next few days (as well as anyone else you feel should be involved in this effort), and I will have Amanda schedule a meeting/room for us to get this started.

Thanks,
Chris

Subject: good morning


I tried calling but noone picked up the phone.  Anyway, I just wanted to check and make sure you don't have any questions about running keystone and socal.  Generally, I put them out there initially with a 2 cent two way until the market gets moving a bit and then tighten keystone up to 1 or 1.5 cents.  All the products should be set to offset to last trade(usually a penny).  Then I just adjust the offset depending on how fast I think the market is moving.  The market tends to get really slow by 9:15, so by then, I'm back to a 2 cent two-way at keystone and a 3 cent two-way at the border.  These markets will still be tighter than ICE.  Also just a reminder, we have 8000 of the Waha gas to sell to the Texas desk.  All transport should be in position already.  Jason may talk to you about moving some of his transport out of Keystone, but not likely.  I would expect that we would probably want to go about 50,000 long for tuesday and then wednesday.  Check with Patti regarding the injection capacity since Socal raised it this weekend and there may be other changes to the schedule.  I'm available for any questions on my cell phone...832-444-7702. 
 
Have fun,

"RE: Memorial Day weekend","Hey baby,
Well, as per usual, the plans are getting all botched.  Why can't people
just commit to a plan and roll with it?  Bill is now going to Disney...what
the f is that all about?  After checking into some new ideas (different
rental properties located near water) we quickly determined that that option
is near impossible at this late date.....	So, now we are trying a few last
ideas and have determined that most likely we will probably just have to
settle for chilling at the point, using Mom and Don's boat and tying up at
the sandbar with Kelly and Mike and their boat, bbq, beer and oh yea, lot's
of beer.  Come to think of it, that sounds great.  I think a few of my
girlfriends from Roch may join us as well.  Should be good!  So what does
your itinerary look likle?   love, k

"Duplicate DRN descriptions","All:

As you all know that the DRN within a pipeline should be unique, the DRN_description should be too. Otherwise
it will cause aggregation errors in our reports, values with the same DRN_description within a pipeline are all summed 
together. I have created a query called qry_Mulri_DRN_Names in the Access database O:\Fundy_ops\ReportSetting.mdb (Access 2000),
You can run this query to find out how many duplicates there are, and which pipeline they are. If you entered those duplicates,
you can work with Hyde or Eddie to have them corrected. Please also pay special attention when you enter new DRN and their 
descriptions. The rule is No Duplicate DRN or DRN descriptions are allowed within the same pipeline.
When in doubt, you can always run the query mentioned above to check duplicates. 

Let me know if you have questions. Thanks.

I am waiting for a response to an email I sent 1 month ago regarding your
database of facilities used to generate the daily plant outage list.  I
would like to cross reference the outage information you provide with other
data from other sources and would like an efficient way to ""join"" the data.
It would be helpful to me if I had a table of plants showing your text name

"Manual Entry","I have the Manual Entry process ready for testing again (testing as in testing by the analysts).  I would prefer to have it used by the analysts at least for a few days to iron out any more potential ""bugs"" before releasing it to users on the floor.  If the consensus is to have people on the floor be the testers, that is fine as well, as long as they know that the following URL points to a development server.

Without further ado, the link to the Manual Entry Page:

http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

As stated in the above URL, this is located on the DEVELOPMENT web server.  Users should honestly never be directed to this URL, unless authorized by one of the site developers, since anything on it is subject to be currently in development (read: potentially broken).

Anyway, here are some things that have been added to the Manual Entry piece in this release:

""Previous"" data now reflects information in the DB for the latest effective date for the selected cycle (not just ""Yesterday"" as before)...
There is now an option to enter data for a ""special cycle 0""...this is to be used on occasions where no data was scraped (for whatever reason), but there is some available that can be manually entered.  Selecting this option causes ALL points for a given pipeline to be displayed (both normally scraped points AND manually entered points).  A cycle of '0' is applied to this data, and it should only show up on reports until valid scrape data becomes available (since the report engine is designed to pull the latest cycle available).
You can now add ""extra"" line items to be stored in the DB...this is to be used when you must enter data for more than one flow type for a given point (i.e. the point is reported as both a Receipt and a Delivery).  This should normally only have to be done the first time data is entered for that pipe, since the ""Previous"" data will handle pulling in and displaying (the next time) every flow type stored for every point on the pipe.

NOTE:  It is set to only allow 1 extra point to be added...this was done to simplify the handling of this feature; I'm open to discussion if you feel there is a need to enter more than one extra point (I see it as a Receipt/Delivery issue...will a point ever be more than that?  Receipt/Delivery/Storage or something?)

I have also fixed the ""Exceptions Occurred"" bug that cropped up recently...this was caused by moving the manually entered points to their own unique pipeline ids.  The Jaguar system did not get updated to account for that, but it is updated now.

Aside from the above, minor tweaks here and there have also been made.  I am going to enlist the aid of Junellen to ""beautify"" the layout, but provided no more bugs appear during testing this should be good to go into production by the beginning of next week.

Any questions, feel free to ask or reply.

Thanks,
Chris

"GMAT Review available at Enron","

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th:
The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be
honored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a
waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. 

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp week is Monday through Friday. 

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your sessions.   The deadline to register is Monday, May 21.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to the Energizer in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Janie

As we discussed, we would like you to consider adding the OXY point for Elk
Hills deliveries into SOCAL at the Gosford intertie to the ""NGI Socal/PG&E
KRS"" physical point. If you look on SOCAL's System Operations report our
deliveries are listed as ""Elk Hills - Gosford Intertie"". Our flows on this
pipeline typically range from 80MM to 165MM/day.

Our gas from  this point interconnects with the PG&E Kern River station gas
that then is delivered through Wheeler Ridge into SOCAL.

Separately we would also be very interested in an SOCAL In state Production
point on Enron OnLine.

"Alas...","As they say, ""All good things must come to an end.""

Unfortunately, this is hardly ever more true than in the IT consulting realm.  I have been informed that as of this Friday (11/30/2001), my assignment here at Enron comes to an end.  Obviously, Enron's current economic uncertainty predicated the need to alleviate any and all ""excess baggage"" (read: consultant/contractor costs).

I truly have enjoyed my time here in the Gas Fundamentals group.  I have definitely learned a great deal from everyone, and hopefully have helped others to do the same.  I leave my contact information below, in hopes that if there is anything I can do for you in the future, you will not hesitate to get in touch with me (especially to let me know what time to be at Front Porch! ;-).

All kidding aside, this has been a great overall experience for me.  From now until Friday, I will be involved in handing off all projects/initiatives that I have been a part of (or directly responsible for).  If there is anything needed of me (between now and then), feel free to give me a call (x5-8885) or stop by (ECS 06836) prior to Friday.

Thanks for everything, and I wish everyone the best of luck in their future endeavors.

Sincerely,
Chris Hyde

Subject:	Plant Outage Task

Colin,

Per our conversation, I have outlined Keith's task for the team....

Background:  Portland maintains in their database a table called ""PlantOutage"".  Records in that table each contain an outage ""BeginOutageDate"", ""EndOutageDate"", ""CapacityOut"" and ""OutageReason"".  Records also include a PlantID (key field for PlantCharacteristics table) and a PlantUnitID (key field for Unitcharacteristics table).  The PlantCharacteristics table contains a ""WSCCRegion"" field and the Unitcharacteristics table contains a ""Fuel_Designation"" field.  

Portland has a stored procedure that for a specified date range can calculate for each date the sum of ""CapacityOut"" for all outage records where the date falls between the ""BeginOutageDate"" and the ""EndOutageDate"".  I have inlcuded the results of this storaged procedure in the attached file.  Our task is similar but requires more detailed subgrouping of the data.

Objective:  The objective is to return the Sum of ""CapacityOut"" by each possible subgrouping for each day in a range (say 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2001).  There are roughly five possible parameters for ""Fuel_Designation"", seven for ""WSCCRegion"", and two for ""OutageReason"".  The resulting query would return approximately 70 values for each day within the specified range.

Format:  Ultimately we will have the date in one excel sheet with dates down the left and each of the 70 sub groupings across the top.  It would be most convenient if the results of the query were formatted in this way.  Alternatively, we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided.  If the second option is used, we will need to get the data in two separate lists since excel can only hand 65,000+ rows.  In this case, we would use the ""OutageReason"" grouping (which only has two parameters) to split out the two lists.  


Thanks for your help.

Mat

"Travelocity.com fare watcher update","Thursday, April 26, 2001

Dear MATHEW,

Travelocity's Fare Watcher, your ultimate tool for keeping on top of
rapidly changing air fares, found fare changes in 4 of the markets
you are watching.  When you review the airfares below, remember that
fares change rapidly!  Low fares sell out quickly, and the sooner you
check, the more likely you are to find available seats.

Have your travel needs changed? Are you looking to go someplace new?
Remember to update your Fare Watcher subscription so that you're
always notified when fares change to your favorite destinations.

To find one of the fares below, point your web browser to your
Personal Fare Watcher Page on Travelocity by clicking on the
following URL link.  You can also copy and paste the URL into your
browser.

"Work Hours","Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

"Organization Announcement","Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

"Northwest Foreign Key Problems","Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key violations as well.  These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key violation):

458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR
611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001)
608 NOVELTY HILL M/S
612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001)

If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be great.  If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.

been calling because I think we had a good time, and
you are a great guy.  I would love to keep in touch

"Cycle 0 For All Pipeliines","I have added a cycle '0' to all pipelines in the database...per our discussion, this cycle will be used only in an 'emergency' type situation (we didn't scrape any data (for whatever reason), and there is some available that can be manually entered).  By being '0', this also shouldn't affect the logic of Yan's reports, since he pulls the latest cycle available (read the largest number; if ANY scraped data gets in the DB, it will be returned in place of any cycle 0 data).

Any questions, feel free to ask...

"Good news about the Financial Times and Dow Jones Interactive","Dear Subscriber:


In our continuous commitment to enhance the services we offer
you, Factiva is proud to announce the expanded availability of
the Financial Times (FT).

Commencing June 16, the full text from all editions of the FT,
including FT.com, will be accessible to all Publications Library
and CustomClips customers.  The FT will continue to be
unavailable in Business Newsstand. The rollout of the full text of
the FT complements Factiva's compelling content set of top must-read
global business sources including The Wall Street Journal and
Dow Jones, Reuters and AP Newswires. In addition, this unique
source combination will be offered at launch in Factiva.com, our
new flagship product.

The full text will replace the FT Abstracts. In order to provide
you with uninterrupted coverage, the full text of all articles
from June 1 on will be made available. The FT abstract archive
to date will continue to be accessible to you as well.

This change will require no action on your part. The full text of
the FT will have the same source codes that were previously applied
to the FT Abstracts. This means your CustomClips folders and saved
searches will automatically get this expanded content - and it will
be available on day of publication to provide you with the most
up-to-date global business information.

If you have any questions, please contact your account executive.

Regards,

Greg Gerdy
Vice President and Director, Product Management
