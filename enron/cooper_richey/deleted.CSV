What is this blather?

emacs? pico? What happened to using real tools like sed and awk?

	Well I'm not giving a talk on Expect, though I could if people
wanted. :)

	I would think it would be worthwhile to meet at produce row and
then move, btw. Produce row is a pretty good spot socially, but I can't
imagine trying to give a talk there.

"[R] 1.3.1/1.4.1 Windows binary incompatibilities?","
  I should probably have been able to figure this out, but ...

  I have a package with some C code in it that I've been cross-building on
my Linux machine to run under Windows.  I had it working under 1.3.1, but
it seems to have stopped with 1.4.1.  Building with a version of
i386-mingw32msv-gcc recently downloaded from Brian Ripley's Rtools page
(--version 2.95.2), under 1.4.1 on Linux, it works under 1.3.1 but fails
under 1.4.1. (The new version of i386-gcc I just downloaded dates back to
3 Sep 2000 according to the Page Info.  The previous version I was using
(which dated to 27 Apr 2000) and the new version give the same --version
information.)  The ""Version""  tab on the DLL does correctly indicate it
was built for 1.4.1.

  Am I missing something stupid?  The Rtools page says the most current
version of mingw is based on gcc 2.95.3; does the cross-compiler need to
be updated?  (I'm not eager to, but I could try to assemble the
pieces and compile from source if I had to ...)

  I did find some information on cross-compiling at the bottom of the
MinGW FAQ list, I may pursue this if no-one has any brilliant ideas ...
(how many people are actually doing Linux/Windows cross-compiling?)

  thanks,

Oh, there appears to be a slight misunderstanding.  Produce Row is the
social meeting and the technical meeting will be at ONSITE! offices, half a
block away.  Same details as the last meeting (which are on
http://portland.pm.org/, which I keep putting off updating)

"Re: [R] R graphs in LaTeX documents?","You have to save your plots/figures in EPS format. EPS is basically the
same as PS (postscript), but it is a one-page document with a
""BoundingBox"".

Example

In [R]:

Alternative 1: Generate the plot *first* and then the eps file
  ...
  plot(sin(1:10), pch=""+"")
  dev.print(device=postscript, ""myFigure.eps"",
            onefile=FALSE, horizontal=FALSE)
  ...

Alternative 2: Generate the eps file directly *without* opening a window.

  ...
  postscript(file=""myFigure.eps"", onefile=FALSE, horizontal=FALSE)
  plot(sin(1:10), pch=""+"")
  dev.off()
  ...


Note that the arguments 'onefile=FALSE, horizontal=FALSE' are important!
In the help for 'postscript' it also says that you ""probably want to set
... paper = ""special"", but I never used this option and it has worked fine
for me without it (actually I don't know what it does).

In LaTeX:

  ...
  Bla bla see Figure~\ref{figMyFigure}.

  \begin{figure}[hbtp]
    \begin{center}
      % Scale the figure to have the height 80mm keeping
      % the width/height ratio.
      \resizebox{!}{80mm}{\includegraphics{myFigure.eps}}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The data used...}
    \label{figMyFigure} % <-- NOTE: After \caption!
  \end{figure}
  ...

This requires that you use ""\usepackage{graphics}"" or
""\usepackage{graphicx}"" at the top your LaTeX document.

[This answer is a correction of my own answer in the ""Re: [R] Latex
Question"" thread from Dec 7, 2001:

  http://www.r-project.org/nocvs/mail/r-help/2001/6836.html

where I forgot the argument 'horizontal=FALSE'.]

I'm going to pretend you didn't insult me by saying pico and you can pretend that I don't use vi.
Fair enough?

[time passes]

There, I updated the page.  Are you happy?  Did you enjoy nagging me?  Did adding to my life's
pressures bring you intense enjoyment?  If I didn't know better, I'd think you were my ex-wife.

:-)

Where the heck does that stuff come from?  Anyone know where I put my medication?

"RE: [R] R graphs in LaTeX documents?","Dear Robert,

You can easily include R-generated pictures in Latex.
One easy way is to use the postscript() command and including
the picures in Latex using \usepackage{graphics} .

It?s as easy as \includegraphics{mygraphicsfile.ps} and you can even do
size customizing in Latex using some commands in this package. (Good
documentation included.)

Hope this helps,
detlef

Generate .eps directly by using dev.copy2eps or from the menu on the
graphics window or by following the instructions in ?postscript.
No conversion should be needed.

That driver does work but is minimally-featured.  Not recommended.

It really is a simple task.  Use dev.copy2eps and then the graphicx
package in latex.  You give us no clue as to your problems, so it is
difficult to give any advice.

Try

print(xyplot(<whatever>))

instead of just xyplot()

xyplot (and all other such functions) produce a ""trellis"" object that

I use LyX (GUI front-end for LaTeX) under linux. For me I just save from R
a postscript file, then in Lyx click ""Insert Figure"" and stick it in. So
It's pretty automatic for me and have never had problems over 4 years of
use.

LyX (www.lyx.org) runs under windows.

The answer is
 summary(g)$coef[,3:4]


The way to find out things like this is to use names() or str() to look at
the glm and summary.glm objects.
   summ<-summary(g)
   names(summ)
# I see a coefficients item. I wonder what it looks like
   summ$coefficients
# That looks familiar, it's the table of coefficients, std erros,
#p-values. I want the last two columns
   summ$coefficients[,3:4]
#Success

Or alternatively, read print.summary.glm() to see where it gets them from.

"[R] Help with replicating an old SPSS GLM analysis","Greetings.

I'm trying to replicate an analysis I did a few years ago, then in SPSS,
using the SPSS GLM command:

GLM
  n_diffpt  WITH age_i inc_i join_i work_i educ_i  give_i cs_i
  eff_i age_a inc_a join_a work_a educ_a give_a cs_a eff_a
  /METHOD = SSTYPE(3)
  /INTERCEPT = INCLUDE
  /PRINT  = PARAMETER ETASQ RSSCP GEF
  /CRITERIA = ALPHA(.05)
  /DESIGN =
        age_i*age_a inc_i*inc_a join_i*join_a work_i*work_a
          educ_i*educ_a give_i*give_a cs_i*cs_a eff_i*eff_a
        age_i inc_i join_i work_i educ_i give_i cs_i eff_i
        age_a inc_a join_a work_a educ_a give_a cs_a eff_a .

The results are consistent when run in SPSS; however, I tried the simple
version of recoding it in R (after using read.spss to bring in the data),
and got entirely different results. I'm assuming there are significant
differences in what I'm doing, but I can't find enough documentation of
the SPSS GLM procedure to figure out what. Can anyone offer insights?

The code I tried under R was:

glm.mean <- glm(N.DIFFPT ~ AGE.I + INC.I + JOIN.I + WORK.I + EDUC.I +
GIVE.I +
        CS.I + EFF.I + AGE.A + INC.A + JOIN.A + WORK.A + EDUC.A + GIVE.A +
        CS.A + EFF.A + AGE.I*AGE.A + INC.I*INC.A + JOIN.I*JOIN.A +
        WORK.I*WORK.A + EDUC.I*EDUC.A + GIVE.I*GIVE.A + CS.I*CS.A +
	EFF.I*EFF.A,
        data=acps.df)

Thanks in advance.

No, it doesn't: it returns an object to be passed to glm.

glm.fit is only used in polr to find starting values, so specify `start'
to polr.

polr is in package MASS, BTW.
