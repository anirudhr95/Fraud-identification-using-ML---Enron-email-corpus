"RE: Friday Festivities!","did you see black hawk down?  i didn't like it that much, but i read the book awhile ago (really good) and its a hard subject to make a movie about.  my brother is in the special forces, so it's scary to think he could be one of those guys.  

just finished playing squash with ian cooke  i'm guessing you know him too?  

i have so little to do at work these days, its hard to be motivated, but i suppose i could have worse things to complain about.  what movies did you rent? sorry if i'm nosy, but see previous sentence.

Hi Cooper, 
Friday night is always a good one.  This was a little better then some, however, my Saturday morning made me regret the increase in the fun factor.
My Saturday night makes your Friday look like a huge shaker.  I rented movies and rarely left my couch.  I haven't had a Saturday like that in months but its nice to take it easy once in a while.
How's Black Hawk Down?  I was going to see it tomorrow. 
Have a good night.

   Hey Cooper, 
   I wanted to thank you again for asking Emily and I to the wine tasting 
   last night.  I had a great time (or as much fun as an uncultured Calgary 
   hick can have) and think we should all do it again soon. 
   Also, I have been enlisted by Emmy to make sure you are coming to 
   Ceili's tonight.  She didn't get a chance to write this morning but 
   wanted to extend the invitation to you one more time.  She won't be done 
   until 5 and so I think we'll head over around then. 
   Ah Ha!  Lunch time!  Hope to see you tonight and have a good rest of 
   your day.

"RE: portland...","hey mara,

i tried to call your phone number, but just got voicemail.  here are my numbers:  (w) 403 974 6946 (h) 403 262 0205 (c) 403 512 3312 - it would be good to chat, but i'll respond here in case you get this and not your voicemail.  also, a better email is ""trycooper@hotmail.com"" i've been meaning to write you (it's on my list) but haven't probly because i'm not sure what to say ... i'm glad you got in touch.  i hope you had fun in belize with your family.  i checked and i don't have brinda's email - sorry about that.  i might have her phone number athome, but that won't do you much good i don't think.  also if you are checking out SFSU, you may want to look up someone named Ingrid Binswanger - i went to college with her and she is ultra-cool and might be able to give you the lowdown.  i think she is doing some sort of joint degree and is probly still there - not sure though.  

um, yeah, i was a bit surprised when you mentioned the 8 year statistic! but i'm not sure what relevance that really has.  it's too bad things are rocky between you and steve, it seems like you've been together forever.  it was a crazy night and i don't know what else to say, hopefully we will stay in touch better as a result?  it's funny to think that i've known you half of my life at this point.  of course, however you want to handle it is fine by me.  well, if you get this while you are in portland or sf, give me a buzz and i'll tell you what i can, otherwise, call or write and let's stay in touch.  good luck shopping for programs.

Hey Cooper,
  Well, I don't know if you remember, but I'm heading out to Portland for an interview.  Prob little to no chance I'll end up there, but what the hell, I've never been and it can't hurt to visit.  I remember you saying that you knew Brinda's email.  Do you think you could send it to me?  I'll be there the 14th.

Otherwise, don't really know what to say.  I'm pretty much still reeling from what happened.  I meant it when I said that nothing like this has happened in the last 8 years.  Unfortunately, my future with Steve is looking a little rocky right now, but I still don't know what my motivation was (drunkenness never an excuse...) and I've been pretty upset.  I haven't seen Steve yet, and to be honest I don't think now is the time to bring this sort of thing up to him.  I decide where I will move in feb, and I think it's best if steve and I go our own ways amicably, without this mess (yes, feeble excuse).

Anyway, don't mean to bring up all this crap, b/c it's not yours, but we've been friends for a long time and I respect you and like you, and I really don't want you to think that this is a frequent occurence.  I do wish I was a little more sober, not b/c it would've changed much, but I think it might've been better all around.

So, any advice on Portland or SF would be appreciated (one night in each).  Call 646 342 3507 or email.

Later,
Mara

i think it will be easy to get back into the swing of thigns -- sitting on

boring.  trading is exciting and i'm looking forward to it - should be like
jumping into a cold pool.  i'm actually doing real work lately which is
great.  i still have no idea what you do at work.  anything interesting?

yes, the new babe lair should be sweet - we'll need auntie's
recommendations.  just make sure you shit in jai's toilet.  it might be
harder for you than me, but peeing on the toilet seat is always a good way
to get your message across - as a woman, i think it would send an
especially clear signal.  are you stopping by this weekend?  i'm having a
couch delivered on sat between 10 and 2, so i think we'll be around then
for sure.

5 times a day is no problem, but 5 times a day seven days a week might be a
push, but with the right stimulation anything is possible.  is chrissy a
5x7 kind of chick?  wow.  and, of course, retention is always an
interesting experiment.

we'll have to go to big wally's - especially if its not my style.  i
haven't spent much time in kensington, but it seems like there are some
good spots there.

   I am looking forward to seeing the new babe lair.  I will have to think

   leave a shit in your toilet.

   Yikes!!!  Chrissy would llliiiikkkkeeee you.  Are you ""up"" to it 5 times

   I like Big Wally's in Kensington.  Ever been there?  I'm not sure it's
   your style.  Ugly waitresses and a hundred degree above heat but I like
   it.  Always packed and a interesting variety of music.  I've never been

Subject:	RE: FYI - out with flu today.

 Just got off the phone with Colin, I pointed him at the code and gave him a short discussion of how the excel vba and dll work. He is going to investigate how things work and get back to me with any questions. Everything should be go to go into production with on the code, so he should not have anything to work on around this code.

Dinner is still on tomorrow. Just head out highway 1A (crowchild trail). After the end of the city, the highway will be a divided highway for about 12km, where it changes to a single lane highway. Keep goiung down that for about 3.5km. At about that time you should see a large radio transmission tower. Just past the radio tower you will see the GlenEagles sign on the south side of the highway. This is Gleneagles Drive. Take Gleneagles Dr. About 1 km down this road you will see a road to your left, go past this and take the next turn (about 1/3 of a mile) which is Gleneagles Blvd. This road is about 150yd long and and then turn to your left which will put you on Gleneagles View. Go to the end of this road about 1/3 of a mile and it will come to a tee. Turn left , you are on Gleneagles Terrace, we are the third house on your right 131 Gleneagles Terrace.

Things should start to happen about 5:00. Just bring your appetite.

Cheers, Greg

She has been going on dates with potential clients.  Funny,  I didn't know you could use those two words in the same sentence!  She never ceases to amaze me (that's what I like about her!).

"RE:","well, i am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  there is not much to do and basically we are waiting around to see what happens to the trading operations, which are supposed to be sold to an investment bank in a week or so.  we'll see ...  at first it was refreshing to not have anything to do and a welcome relief from the frenetic atmosphere i'm used to here, but now it's a challenge to find productive ways to fill the time and i don't work very long days.  

i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good to be back, too.  

your schedule sounds very packed - maybe you would like to suggest a time/place that fits in?  it's been forever since i've seen you and i would be up for anything:  coffee, lunch, dinner, drinks, basically anything.  

take care,
cooper

   Okay sorry yes I guess my schedule is really full but I love it and am
   living the way I have wanted to for a long time.  How about Sunday we
   could
   get together in the afternoon or evening I am playing squash at the Y
   around
   4 I believe and am going to meet a friend of my at the Red Devil did you
   want to join us or maybe get together before that?  Possibly if that
   does
   not work for you then I believe next Sat or Sunday could be good as
   well.
   Are you still doing Yoga?  I have yet to give it a try I am working so
   much.
   I am going to the gym daily  though and am very happy with that.  Well
   write
   me soon and let me know what is happening with you.
   If Enron sells the trading operations what will you do then?

   well, i am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  there is
   not
   much to do and basically we are waiting around to see what happens to
   the
   trading operations, which are supposed to be sold to an investment bank
   in
   a week or so.  we'll see ...  at first it was refreshing to not have
   anything to do and a welcome relief from the frenetic atmosphere i'm
   used
   to here, but now it's a challenge to find productive ways to fill the
   time
   and i don't work very long days.

   i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of
   loving
   being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and
   needing
   to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving
   hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did
   very
   little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been
   away
   from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good
   to
   be back, too.

   your schedule sounds very packed - maybe you would like to suggest a
   time/place that fits in?  it's been forever since i've seen you and i
   would
   be up for anything:  coffee, lunch, dinner, drinks, basically anything.

   take care,
   cooper

Subject:	Be a Tour Guide in the Yucatan

Hi all,
wanna spend the winter leading eco-tours in the yucatan? check this out.

Background
CESiaK is located on the Caribbean Coast of Mexico, near the Mayan Ruins
of Tulum, south of Cancun. Still under development, the center is a small
ecotourism and education center that will serve as a model for sustainable
development in sensitive tropical ecosystems. The revenue generated
through tours and various on-site activities is used to fund conservation
and education programs within the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve. The Center
operates using ecologically responsible technologies, including systems
for wetland waste management, rainwater collection, and solar and wind
energy generation. It also focuses on community development, educational
outreach programs, turtle conservation programs, and biological research,
including propagation and  revegetation of native plants. CESiaK provides
a model for other sustainable development projects as well as an
informational resource for the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve.

Eco-Tourism Guide Position
At CESiaK we currently offer an all-day, educational, sight-seeing boat
tour through the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve and a shorter sunset tour
emphasizing bird-watching.

Highlights of the Tour include:
? Following the Mayan trade route used 1200 years ago
? Seeing abundant flora and fauna unique to Sian Ka'an
? Visiting unexcavated Mayan ruins hidden within the Reserve
? Floating down a freshwater river and swimming in natural sink-holes
? Learning the natural and Mayan history of the Reserve with experienced
guides

The primary responsibility of the tour guide is to lead these tours and
educate tourists about the unique diversity of ecosystems, flora, and
fauna found within the Reserve. Other responsibilities include preparing
food coolers for the tours, communicating problems with tour equipment,
and driving and maintaining the two tour vans. Depending on qualifications
and interest, the guide would also work with other staff members to carry
out other programs undertaken by CESiaK.


Qualifications
The ideal candidate would have an undergraduate or graduate degree in
biology or environmental science, as well as an interest and understanding
of general socio-economic issues of Latin America, including Mayan culture
and history. However, all candidates with a strong interest in learning
will certainly be considered. Once hired, the guide will be thoroughly
trained to lead the tours. Because in many senses the tour guide is the
face of the organization, it is crucial to have proven exemplary
communication skills, command of the Spanish language, an independent
motivation to self-manage the broad responsibilities of the tours, and a
dedication to conservation.

Cooper:

Did you say shopping?????  My eyes lit up as I read it accross the screen.  (Just kidding).  That sounds great.  I made some progress on the X-mas list on Friday, but still have some to go.  How about a combo - shopping + dinner OR shopping + drinks?  I am working with my research assistant today trying to get my data ready for input.  I forgot to recharge my cell battery - so if I am not home when you call, I will call you back.

I don't know if you are speaking to me or not but what happened...You
missed a good one!

I went to my game at 10pm and got back to Tania's about 12:15 and started
to light it up with shooters.

We stayed up until 6am.  At about 4am one of Tania's grumpy lesbian
neighbors barged into her living room and told us that she hadn't been able
to sleep for the last 4 hours.  Needless to say Tania was not impressed as
the lesbian bitch could have just called.

Anyway I am going to get a coffee soon, don't know if you are interested.

Hey Cooper,
 
I would like to get your opinion and approval on a couple of things:
 
1) We'd like to get a development IIS server running, and so would also like to move your development from NETCo's only production IIS server, to this new server.  I believe Greg is setting this up shortly.
 
2) Since the PowerFS1 server is now the production web server for all of NETCo, we'd like to move the IIS administration duties to the IT team, which would most likely mean to me. (I'm assuming you have these duties right now?  If not, maybe you could point me in the right direction)
 
3) Also because of that, we need to move at least one web application on to PowerFS1.(Presenter is the one NETCo web app moving over that is in Production.  Origman will be there shortly as well.)  Since Pavel used MSXML3 with SP1 and would need it on the box, I was wondering what version are you running? (He tells me that multiple versions can be run at the same time, as they are separately named libraries and files).
 
Thanks for your time.
 
Let me know what you think about all of this,

If you're part of the CalData_GasFund NT group, you will have full access to Alberta Gas.

As for AlbertaPower, you have full access to the dev database, and the same access as Colin has for the Prod database.

For getting server access on OLAP, you'll have to talk to Greg, I believe.

That reminds me, how did your test of SQL Server 2000 OLAP go?

Chris,


I need to get whatever access Greg and Colin had to AlbertaPower and AlbertaGas databases on dev and prod.

I may already have it, but I'm not sure, especially about the AlbertaGas database.  

basically, their accounts have been cleared from the network and I need to run things under my own account, 
rather than theirs.  

Also, on dev db, I need to admin rights as Colin had these to do some OLAP stuff.  I'm guessing you are not the
person to talk to about this?

Been limited to plugging things together with Excel and not much database creativity, more analysis, which is good but a bit limiting at times with the internal Police preventing flexibility !

i don't have your phone number at work.  i have some bad news - i'll be flying out 3 days 
later than i told you before.  either my booking got screwed up or i never booked the flight!
i think it got lost on the internet some where, but i can't even remember what airline it was
on, so it's impossible for me to check!  just booked a one week flight and i'll be coming 
out on the 19th.  i'm still going to take the days off from work and relax in calgary a little,
which is good.  

by the way, if you haven't already gotten me something, i thought of a xmas present.  
a squash raquet.  lots of people play here and i'm looking to get into it.

   Jai,
   I haven't written you a long e-mail ina while, so I thought it was about
   time - just for old times sake!
   I guess there is also something I wanted to say...so here goes.
   When we first started e-mailing and hanging out,  you were alot of fun
   (well, you still are),  and I thought it was the beginning of a
   friendship.
   Then after a short time,  I realized that there was more.  I just went
   with
   it and went with what I thought felt right.  Recently,  for me at least,
   everyone seems have involved themselves in a simple situation ,  making
   everything more complicated and confusing (I guess this is my payback
   for
   being such a big mouth/ gossiper about everyone else).

   Now,  everything just seems weird.
    What happened to that ""waitress/ customer"" bond we once had???....(I
   thought I would throw that last part in here to lighten the mood of this
   e-mail).

   Everything just happened so quickly,  that looking back it's hard to
   believe
   that all this happened in a month.  I guess why I'm writing you this is
   to
   let you know that I think your an amazing person,  and someone that I
   consider a friend.  At the same time,  this friendship is not anything
   that
   I'm going to force.

   I'm not expecting a response from this e-mail and I'm not asking for
   anything.  I just wanted to let you know where I was coming from.  What
   better way to do it then over e-mail - afterall,  isn't that how this
   all
   started?

   Emily

"RE:","eze:

I put in a call to the deloitte systems admin to have your email name changed to ""Purtzki, Eze"".  I hope you don't mind.  

I'm tired from moving.  Enron's moved me in the past and I'm used to just pointing and saying ""that will go over there"", etc.  and i spent all sunday night packing up my shit.  ugh.  most of it has been moved which is good.  i don't think you've ever seen my loft, but to get to it, you have to take the elevator up one building and then walk across the roof of another building (picture gravel with flagstones that are spaced for janice to walk across) and then into the floor of my building.  once the movers saw this, I think they almost quit!  it was bad, but they did a great job.  I told one of them, ""the building i'm moving into will be a breeze compared to this one"" and he laughed and said ""of course, you have the worst apartment i've ever moved"".  poor guy.  that's the most entertaining tidbit i could come up with.  

you should meet the building manager in our new building.  he's a freak, but in a professional way.  he's already yelled at jai and i.  he sounds russian and says in a thick accent ""if you vant to leeve here, you haf to obey da rrrulesss"".  i hope you read that with a russian accent in your head.  he has video cameras set up that feed into his kitchen!  his wife is a piece of work as well.  

count me in for the wine fest.  if you pick up some tix, grab me one, or let me know where the website is, etc.    

i can't believe you've moved on from tubulars.  while tubulars does seem like the next big thing, oil and gas seems like a promising area to study.

i left fairly quickly on friday night - sorry i didn't say goodbye - i was in a strange mood, maybe being sick and drunk?  anyway, i feel like i should have socialized more there and regret not talking to janice more, but it was great to see earls people outside of earls amongst friends.  

why don't we go to YIM instead of the Space?  i'm happy to go to yoga with other people instead of alone and i can go to any yoga class and enjoy myself, although rockne gets on my nerves if i let him.  i think janice wants to come too?  

congratulations on passing all of your courses.  i found graduating to be somewhat anti-climactic - i wish you had a ceremony to go to, but maybe things are different in canada.  

i finished reading tuesdays with morrie - great book - it's good to be reminded of certain things in life.

i think it will be easy to get back into the swing of thigns -- sitting on my ass for two months has been a nice distraction, but its gotten really boring.  trading is exciting and i'm looking forward to it - should be like jumping into a cold pool.  i'm actually doing real work lately which is great.  i still have no idea what you do at work.  anything interesting?  

yes, the new babe lair should be sweet - we'll need auntie's recommendations.  just make sure you shit in jai's toilet.  it might be harder for you than me, but peeing on the toilet seat is always a good way to get your message across - as a woman, i think it would send an especially clear signal.  are you stopping by this weekend?  i'm having a couch delivered on sat between 10 and 2, so i think we'll be around then for sure.  

5 times a day is no problem, but 5 times a day seven days a week might be a push, but with the right stimulation anything is possible.  is chrissy a 5x7 kind of chick?  wow.  and, of course, retention is always an interesting experiment.  

we'll have to go to big wally's - especially if its not my style.  i haven't spent much time in kensington, but it seems like there are some good spots there.

I am looking forward to seeing the new babe lair.  I will have to think of a very cool housewarming gift.  Oh yeah....you guys didn't buy ME anything.  Maybe I will just come by and take a dip in the pool and leave a shit in your toilet.

Yikes!!!  Chrissy would llliiiikkkkeeee you.  Are you ""up"" to it 5 times a day?

I like Big Wally's in Kensington.  Ever been there?  I'm not sure it's your style.  Ugly waitresses and a hundred degree above heat but I like it.  Always packed and a interesting variety of music.  I've never been to the Auburn Saloon.

Eagerly awaiting a response.  Write SOON!

Good morning Cooper! 
I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still refusing to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed.  
No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are in town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've gone soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two colder people in my life.
Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work.  You'll have to tell him I say hi.  
I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing most of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming?
Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon.

   Hi Cooper, 
   Friday night is always a good one.  This was a little better then some, 
   however, my Saturday morning made me regret the increase in the fun 
   factor. 
   My Saturday night makes your Friday look like a huge shaker.  I rented 
   movies and rarely left my couch.  I haven't had a Saturday like that in 
   months but its nice to take it easy once in a while. 
   How's Black Hawk Down?  I was going to see it tomorrow. 
   Have a good night.

        Hey Cooper, 
        I wanted to thank you again for asking Emily and I to the wine 
     tasting 
        last night.  I had a great time (or as much fun as an uncultured 
     Calgary 
        hick can have) and think we should all do it again soon. 
        Also, I have been enlisted by Emmy to make sure you are coming to 
        Ceili's tonight.  She didn't get a chance to write this morning but 
        wanted to extend the invitation to you one more time.  She won't be 
     done 
        until 5 and so I think we'll head over around then. 
        Ah Ha!  Lunch time!  Hope to see you tonight and have a good rest 
     of 
        your day.

Hey Karl!

great to hear from you.  someday we will talk - maybe today?  not sure if you're still in, but i'm at my desk.  number is 403 974 6946 
i believe it is the same country code as US, but not sure.  

it's been bad here at work for the last few weeks and its going to take awhile for things to get better, i'm just hoping it doesn't get any
worse.  it was very dicey for awhile - thought ene was going tits up.  

spanish desk sounds great!  say hi to kristian and paul for me, but we should catch up by phone, if possible, so i'll leave it there.

Hey, how you doing ? Still hanging in there ? Is the snow on the mountains yet for Skiing ?

Back in London slowly getting to grips with the changes that have taken place, not quite visible at first...

I am working with Paul again on the Spanish desk along with Kristian and things are a little interesting in the market.

Been limited to plugging things together with Excel and not much database creativity, more analysis, which is good but a bit limiting at times with the internal Police preventing flexibility !

Are you in the office today, I have a question for you ?

Jai,
I haven't written you a long e-mail ina while, so I thought it was about
time - just for old times sake!
I guess there is also something I wanted to say...so here goes.
When we first started e-mailing and hanging out,  you were alot of fun
(well, you still are),  and I thought it was the beginning of a friendship.
Then after a short time,  I realized that there was more.  I just went with
it and went with what I thought felt right.  Recently,  for me at least,
everyone seems have involved themselves in a simple situation ,  making
everything more complicated and confusing (I guess this is my payback for
being such a big mouth/ gossiper about everyone else).

Now,  everything just seems weird.
 What happened to that ""waitress/ customer"" bond we once had???....(I
thought I would throw that last part in here to lighten the mood of this
e-mail).

Everything just happened so quickly,  that looking back it's hard to believe
that all this happened in a month.  I guess why I'm writing you this is to
let you know that I think your an amazing person,  and someone that I
consider a friend.  At the same time,  this friendship is not anything that
I'm going to force.

I'm not expecting a response from this e-mail and I'm not asking for
anything.  I just wanted to let you know where I was coming from.  What
better way to do it then over e-mail - afterall,  isn't that how this all
started?

Emily

in terms of what i do, before enron went under, i was the short term alberta power trader.  since then, i have been champion internet surfer and investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle.  although, things are looking up.  

eze is (i think) an earls nickname -- pronounced easy-e.  although, they may just call her easy for short.  i'm sure she loves both names very much.

You know what the worst thing in the world is?  Having no work to do on a Friday but being unable to leave for hours.  I've been here for three months and this is the first day where I haven't been busy.  This is a Type A's worst nightmare.  E-mail is my sole consolation.
So what do I do, you ask?  I'm in Gas Operations, the marketer's right hand man.  I do logistics, volume and supply/demand analysis, nominations, monitoring of accounts, damage control...you know, more or less hold the company together.  What exactly do you do over there?
Everyone always sees Emmy at Banana Republic.  She's a staple there.  Where did you get eze from?  I'm sure she loves it.  She never gets very flattering nick names.

   I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still refusing 
   to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed. 
   No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are in

   soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two 
   colder people in my life. 
   Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work. 
   You'll have to tell him I say hi. 
   I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my

   of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers

Hey Cooper,
  Well, I don't know if you remember, but I'm heading out to Portland for an interview.  Prob little to no chance I'll end up there, but what the hell, I've never been and it can't hurt to visit.  I remember you saying that you knew Brinda's email.  Do you think you could send it to me?  I'll be there the 14th.

Otherwise, don't really know what to say.  I'm pretty much still reeling from what happened.  I meant it when I said that nothing like this has happened in the last 8 years.  Unfortunately, my future with Steve is looking a little rocky right now, but I still don't know what my motivation was (drunkenness never an excuse...) and I've been pretty upset.  I haven't seen Steve yet, and to be honest I don't think now is the time to bring this sort of thing up to him.  I decide where I will move in feb, and I think it's best if steve and I go our own ways amicably, without this mess (yes, feeble excuse).

Anyway, don't mean to bring up all this crap, b/c it's not yours, but we've been friends for a long time and I respect you and like you, and I really don't want you to think that this is a frequent occurence.  I do wish I was a little more sober, not b/c it would've changed much, but I think it might've been better all around.

So, any advice on Portland or SF would be appreciated (one night in each).  Call 646 342 3507 or email.

Later,
Mara

What up, man!

Things have been extremely busy during the past 90 days or so.  We are
preparing to deploy on 7 Jan.  I will be home with Tina from the 20th to the
27th.  I guess Jimi is having an engagement party on the 21st.  I would love
it if you could make it to that.  You will need to talk to Jim for details.

Yes, I am engaged.  Crazy, huh?  It feels good though.  Tina and I are
happy.  More to follow whence I see ya.

I have to run, but just wanted to let you know I was hanging in there and
doing well.

Peace, Howie

Hey Cooper, 
I wanted to thank you again for asking Emily and I to the wine tasting last night.  I had a great time (or as much fun as an uncultured Calgary hick can have) and think we should all do it again soon.
Also, I have been enlisted by Emmy to make sure you are coming to Ceili's tonight.  She didn't get a chance to write this morning but wanted to extend the invitation to you one more time.  She won't be done until 5 and so I think we'll head over around then.
Ah Ha!  Lunch time!  Hope to see you tonight and have a good rest of your day.

Hi,

I work at Enron as a power trader and Gary Hagerty asked me to forward any prospects for a ""junior power risk management"" position at Epcor onto you. 

Michael Wong worked for us on booking the Sundance B PPA position and was let go soon after this was sold to TransCanada/Altagas and if you're still looking for someone, he would be worth investigating.

don't think i can make yoga tonight - i went climbing last night and inflamed some tendonitis i have in my arm so i'm going to chill out for a few days.  however, i have made plans to see the royal t's with dorland tonight - so here's a look if you haven't already seen it.  

and to respond to your earlier email (i can't keep up):
the meeting i had on sunday was fine - it's always good to see what else is out there.  

the pipe and casing industry sounds fascinating - i can't wait until you're an expert and you can hold forth on the intricacies over some earls carrot cake.  and speaking of earls desserts, anything would be better than the gingerbread cake.  also, has earls updated the propaganda on the left hand side of the menu, specifically the ""featured ingredients"" section?  

not sure when you're going to get this, actually.  

oh, i'm going to a wine tasting at the double mo cafe on thursday night if you/jamie are interested.  do you interested in wine?  my friend craig's wife owns the cafe which is near the university.  i always have fun when i go, so give it some thought if you like wine.  i think it's going to be a new zealand/australian theme.

mostly taking care of errands etc since i don't have much to do at work
these days.  hopefully that will be changing soon.

um, chrissy is much too cute to be playing with her toys alone.

i'm not sure why lucky sucked - i think it was the crowd we met up with
there.  you two should have come and it would have been more fun i'm sure.

   SDC,

   Sunday it is then.  I already know what I'm going to have!

   It was really great to see you on Saturday.  It has been much too long.
   What have you been doing with yourself?

   We didn't end up hitting Cowboys.  We were both a little tired and a lot
   cold.  I went home and watched a little t.v and it's a sure bet that
   Chrissy went home and played with her toys!

   Why was Lucky so terrible?

Hey Cooper, 
I remember you telling me your address,  so I really hope this is it.  I guess I could call you,  but it's more fun to e-mail...especially at work.  Deloitte just gave me a new laptop....the perks of working for a prestigious law firm!!!  Stephanie and I even got a dozen cookies each from Cookies by George yesterday.  It's  a good way to make friends in an office full of vultures (almost worse than Earls!).  
Are you still going to yoga tomorrow??  So far,  Janice, Jaimie,  Stephanie and I are going.  I know it's alot of women.  But don't worry, I told them all about ""naked yoga"" and they're okay with it.  
Next time I see you I'll give you that book,  Tuesdays with Morrie.  I am almost done.  It's an amazing book.  It is simple,  but in it's simplicity it is so profound.  Wow,  that might have been a little too deep for e-mail,  but you get the point.  It's an easy read.  Jai should probably read it too.
Hey,  how are your Scooby snacks???  Are you bringing them to work?  Are the stickers plastered all over your apartment and car yet??  I sure hope so.
Talk to you later, 
Emily

   little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been
   away
   from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good

   your schedule sounds very packed - maybe you would like to suggest a

I need to get whatever access Greg and Colin had to AlbertaPower and AlbertaGas databases on dev and prod.

I may already have it, but I'm not sure, especially about the AlbertaGas database.  

basically, their accounts have been cleared from the network and I need to run things under my own account, 
rather than theirs.  

Also, on dev db, I need to admin rights as Colin had these to do some OLAP stuff.  I'm guessing you are not the
person to talk to about this?

rockne is a special treat.  at least he isn't hairy.  i've found yoga to be a good antidote to modern life.

great to see you last night at banana.  i can't wait to wear my blue pants, but it seems like they should follow the white pants rule, so i don't think i'll break them out until labor day.  definitely a good purchase, since i'll probably wear them twice (total).

How's it going?  
I just had coffee with Jill....so early!! 
Let me tell you,  you missed quite the yoga class last night.  Rockne was in the class,  about 1 meter to my right  (which meant that I was facing him for the most of the class).  He took it upon himself to take his shirt off.  It was quite a treat!  I am still trying to block that sight out of my mind.  The instructor was good.  I've never seen her before,  but she was very mellow.  I was so relaxed after the class,  it was just what I needed. I have been super busy and kind of stressed out lately,  so this was just what I needed.  I would like to go to core again.  I would like to take Yanny there.  Speaking of Yanny,  I don't have her e-mail,  but you should call her.  I know that she would love to hear from you (686-8815).
Jai told me you guys went to earls bankers hall,  and that the service wasn't nearly as good (okay,  I added the last part!!).  You guys should come to Tin Palace (remember 251??,  or has it been too long?).  I'm sure all the lounge girls would love to see you.  It would be a good opportunity to catch up on all the latest (and greatest) Earls gossip.
Are you excited to move this weekend?  If you need any help just let me know.  Afterall,  I have quite a talent for assembling furniture (especially shelves)!  Anytime after 2am,  when I'm done working at Earls will work for me!!
Have a super day.  Friday is almost here..........

i'm glad you made it to yoga last night.  how did you think the space 
compares to YIM?  don't worry, you won't hurt my feelings...  they're very 
different and i'm always surprised when people prefer something like YIM, 
but yoga tastes vary widely.  i thought last night's class was excellent 
and i'm glad we all got to go.  i'm not sure why jai goes to yoga - i've 
been to a few classes with him and it's always the same deep frustration 
with poses, but ... 
yah, the jump thru to seated is fun, eh?  last night i was playing around 
with it following her directions and i realized how terrible it is to not 
be able to jump thru smoothly.  once you do it once you can do it forever. 
also fun is to do the reverse - i think the mechanics are easier on the 
reverse and then you'll be able to do full vinyasa smoothly. 
ian's email is indeed ian.cooke@enron.com 
ceilis could be fun tomorrow.  let me know when you go.  this week has gone 
by quickly.  i can understand how you didn't see the scooby stickers on my 
car because it was dark, but what about the one on my forehead last night?

"happy new year","hey nicki-

i got back yesterday and am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good to be back, too.  

i hope you had a relaxing break and are feeling productive again.

"RE: happy new year","that motherboard does look sweet!  why the scsi drives though?  personally, i want to find a RAID card that can handle RAID5 (everything i've seen is 0,1,or 0+1) and then link up a bunch of smallish IDE drives - if the controller is good, you don't need super fast and expensive drives, so you get speed and redundancy.  as i look at hardware, i can't believe how much enron was paying compaq for hardware - it's amazing.  as for parts, what do you think about ordering from the cheapest U.S. source and paying duty?   

coffee or lunch would be great.  supposed to be big news about the enron auction today, but things are very slow and i'm more or less available any time - whenever you're next in town, give me a buzz, or if you're looking for a reason to come into town, how about tuesday or wednesday -- lunch or an afternoon coffee?

Subject:	Re: happy new year

 We have delayed our trip to France, AGAIN! Janet threatened to divorce me if we don't go on a holiday soon, but she never follows through with her threats. Promises, promises.

Hardware... I'm in the process of building the ultimate server, myself. Check out the new Tyan S2466 motherboard. Sweeeet!. This with, a couple of AMD MP 1900+ processors and SCSI 15000 RPM U160 drives, this should be the ultimate. Hooked on the other end of the pipe to one of the servers at enron, it should push back so hard that those old Compaqs sream for mercy.

I'm shopping for hardware all over, really just out of the Computer Paper and by dropping into a couple of computer stores here and there. Memory Express, OA Group all have good prices, but I can probably get even better prices from a small computer shop out here in Cochrane. He'll order it in for me and I can negotiate with him.

How was everything back East. Hope you had a good time and got all caught on rest, relaxation and visiting.

I'm getting bushed sitting at home learning all the .net crap and am always anxious to get out for coffee or lunch. Let me know if we can catch a coffee sometime.

i'm glad you made it to yoga last night.  how did you think the space compares to YIM?  don't worry, you won't hurt my feelings...  they're very different and i'm always surprised when people prefer something like YIM, but yoga tastes vary widely.  i thought last night's class was excellent and i'm glad we all got to go.  i'm not sure why jai goes to yoga - i've been to a few classes with him and it's always the same deep frustration with poses, but ...  

yah, the jump thru to seated is fun, eh?  last night i was playing around with it following her directions and i realized how terrible it is to not be able to jump thru smoothly.  once you do it once you can do it forever.  also fun is to do the reverse - i think the mechanics are easier on the reverse and then you'll be able to do full vinyasa smoothly.

ian's email is indeed ian.cooke@enron.com

ceilis could be fun tomorrow.  let me know when you go.  this week has gone by quickly.  i can understand how you didn't see the scooby stickers on my car because it was dark, but what about the one on my forehead last night?

Hey Cooper, 
I wanted to thank you again for asking Emily and I to the wine tasting last night.  I had a great time (or as much fun as an uncultured Calgary hick can have) and think we should all do it again soon.
Also, I have been enlisted by Emmy to make sure you are coming to Ceili's tonight.  She didn't get a chance to write this morning but wanted to extend the invitation to you one more time.  She won't be done until 5 and so I think we'll head over around then.
Ah Ha!  Lunch time!  Hope to see you tonight and have a good rest of your day.

Subject:	MS Sql server and Perl

OK, I have a question for the group.  I've got a Perl web-based
app which I've been using Mysql as the back end database.  The
plan was that this was going to be migrated to either Oracle or
DB2 as the back end, but I had a curve ball thrown at me, and
someone made a decision (a bad one in my opinion) that I would
have Microsoft SQL server as my database.  This isn't a decision
I am going to be able to change.

I've done some searching on the net and on CPAN for modules to
talk to the database (DBD drivers/etc), and I've found one module
called DBD::FreeTDS which can directly talk to MS SQL (however that
appears to not even exist anymore).

So, my real question is: what is the best method for being able to
talk to a MS Sql server?  Anybody with a fair bit of experience in
doing this?  Any gotchas I should look for?  Any books/websites I
should go to?


Thanks.

 but more of a mix any kind of drink that people want to drink.  Whatever you want to call it...it will be fun!! I'll talk to you tomorrow about directions to Jaimies and times etc.  
Yes,  I am working at Earls this weekend.  I am working Sunday night. Speaking of Earls,  I know how much you liked the gingerbread....but the feature dessert just changed to carrot cake!  You'll have to come in and try it.
I a going for drinks this afternoon with Stephanie, Jaimie, and Sandy(I think you met her on Saturday at Lucky).  I think we're going to Ceilis after work.  You should come for a drink...afterall,  a drink with friends is a perfect compliment to a long work week!

   everyone reads it quickly so I can pass it along to the next!  The wine

   other fun people.  We are all going to the Whiskey afterwards,  so tell 
   everyone to meet us there afterwards.  You can bring whoever you want to 
   the wine party.  Speaking of bringing someone...whatever happened to 
   that girl that you went on that date with, you know, the one who ordered 
   the crantini??  I hope that isn't getting to personal...but come on, you 
   can tell me, we're friends.  I promise I won't say anything.(even though

If you're part of the CalData_GasFund NT group, you will have full access to Alberta Gas.

As for AlbertaPower, you have full access to the dev database, and the same access as Colin has for the Prod database.

For getting server access on OLAP, you'll have to talk to Greg, I believe.

That reminds me, how did your test of SQL Server 2000 OLAP go?

Chris,


I need to get whatever access Greg and Colin had to AlbertaPower and AlbertaGas databases on dev and prod.

I may already have it, but I'm not sure, especially about the AlbertaGas database.  

basically, their accounts have been cleared from the network and I need to run things under my own account, 
rather than theirs.  

Also, on dev db, I need to admin rights as Colin had these to do some OLAP stuff.  I'm guessing you are not the
person to talk to about this?

Good morning Cooper! 
I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still refusing to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed.  
No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are in town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've gone soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two colder people in my life.
Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work.  You'll have to tell him I say hi.  
I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing most of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming?
Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon.

Subject: New Distributed Denial of Service Program in the Wild 

A new denial of service worm program, - like ""sadmind"", ""nimda"", etc. - has been discovered by the staff of SecurityFocus. This new program attacks Microsoft SQL servers that do not have a password set on their administrator accounts (named ""sa""). Strange as it may seem, I know from experience that we have had a number of SQL servers at Enron that would be vulnerable to this (i.e., they don't have passwords on their ""sa"" accounts).

I am running a scan now on port 1433 only (where SQL server runs) to try to identify all vulnerable servers we may have. I will be providing this list to Eddie Ray and the EEL IT Security team for coordination of the remediation work.

Details on the worm can be found at <http://www.securityfocus.com/> on the front page.

"canadian tax status","Hi,

I'm responding to an email sent by Tim Callahan on Nov 30 regarding questions on tax equalization.  I also left a voice-message for you.  

I'm in the Calgary office and paid out of the U.S.  I've been operating under the assumption that i 
wouldn't get hit twice on income taxes as there is a ""credit"" between Canada and the U.S.  However, after doing some reasearch on the IRS website, it seems there may be a cap to the ""credit"" that is allowable.  Do you know anything about this? or can you point me to someone who might be knowledgeable in such matters?  

thanks,

Search the list archives, for this is an FAQ.

Hint: the copy of R.1.4.0 on CRAN compiled for Windows does not work

get the copy announced by me about Dec 20.

"RE: apologies and attachments","dear elissa-

it's great to hear from you and i'm pleased you thought of my on your christmas list.  it seems like we started to get in touch awhile ago and then i think i dropped the ball.  oops.  i hope you are well and happy new year to you too.  i am still working for Enron, a company you have perhaps read about in the news recently.  things are ok with that for the moment, but i don't really know what's in my future.  probly know more soon.  i live in calgary (did you know?) and have for the last year or so.  i like canada very much.  much more than i expected, although it is very cold here.  mostly the people i like, especially but not limited to all the comely young women.  

are you still in NC?  are you going to make Ben a respectable man anytime soon?  

i got back from almost three weeks vacation yesterday and am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that, since i do very little all day.  i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  

i wish you had sent one of those genero-grams in your holiday card so i would know what you're up to.  send a note when you get a chance.  

also, if you can think of it, reply to trycooper@hotmail.com as i'm better at keeping in touch from home.  

one big hug,
cooper

Subject:	Supply Shortfall Procedures

As I have discussed with many of you, we are revising the Power Pool Supply
Shortfall Procedures (POP 801) in accordance with Transmission Operating
Policy OP-107.  POP 801 contains several steps from the time all the energy
in the energy market merit order has been dispatched up, to the time when a
firm load directive will be issued by the System Controller to curtail firm
load. In order to gather the information required to develop the procedure,
would you please answer the following questions.  Any action you choose to
take is on a voluntary and best effort basis, without any obligation on your
behalf.

In an effort to reduce the amount of, or possibility of having to issue, a
firm load directive to curtail load, would you please reply whether you will
comply with any of the following requests from the System Controller prior
to the issuing of a firm load directive to curtail load.  Please reply not
applicable (N/A) to the questions that do not apply to you.  If you will
comply to any of these requests, we will include the request(s) in the steps
identified in POP 801.  Also, if you will comply to any of these requests,
please indicate the appropriate party for the System Controller to contact.
If you choose not to comply with any of these requests please reply that you
will not.  This will let us know not to make a request for something that
will not be provided, which otherwise could cause confusion and waste
valuable time during the management of this type of an event.

1. Would you provide available generation energy that was not offered into
the energy market merit order if requested to do so by the System Controller
prior to a firm load directive to curtail load?

Name of Plant:				Response (Y/N):
If yes, please indicate who the System Controller is to contact:

over at all is not a good sign - one thing you can do is park on a hill
when you're in doubt and then you can roll-start your jeep (if you have a
standard) if you didn't let it charge long enough - if the battery is
really, really dead, though, this won't work.  where's your jeep now?

This is the response.  What do you think?

Glad you could come. Im sure we will have another soon! I really love

having friends over on that scale. We usually have a few in the summer.

You'll have to meet Andrea and I for a beer at Ceili's some Friday night- we

seem to be having as few too many these days.

well, i am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  there is not
much to do and basically we are waiting around to see what happens to the
trading operations, which are supposed to be sold to an investment bank in
a week or so.  we'll see ...  at first it was refreshing to not have
anything to do and a welcome relief from the frenetic atmosphere i'm used
to here, but now it's a challenge to find productive ways to fill the time
and i don't work very long days.

i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving
being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing
to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving
hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very
little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away
from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good to
be back, too.

your schedule sounds very packed - maybe you would like to suggest a
time/place that fits in?  it's been forever since i've seen you and i would
be up for anything:  coffee, lunch, dinner, drinks, basically anything.

take care,
cooper

Rgui and Rterm crash when I invoke ""xyplot"" or ""trellis.device"" commands (including the oft-used ""quakes"" example)

Rgui.exe has generated errors and will be closed by Windows.  
You will need to restart the program.

this seems to happen right after the graphics window is spawned. 

I'm using lattice version 0.4-0 and grid version 0.5

am I missing some sort of prep work for lattice graphics?

"RE: Be a Tour Guide in the Yucatan","gotcha.  hood river would be a sweet place to live for awhile.  

alberta's great.  getting very cold here, but it's been puking in the mountains, so i'm looking forward
to getting out skiing, etc.  with the nosedive enron is taking, it's easy to blow out of work and head
to banff.  

alberta just built a 40MW wind farm (doubling wind capacity in the region) with more on the way.  should
be over 1% of installed capacity for the region soon.  

have fun in mejico.

nope, I figure you've been busy, and I haven't actually had time to start
working on it.  I am heading down to mexico in a couple of weeks to
interview on a wind/solar/eco-design project down there. Relocation to
P-town tentatively planned for next summer. There are a number of
interesting projects on windpower in the hood river region that I am
investigating.  we'll see how that works out.

how'z alberta?

Chris Wiebe has been taking care of things here and interacting with Houston

Hi Cooper,  

How are things going?  I presume not stunningly!  We have already canned 40% of IT staff and who knows what's going to happen next?

We are about to hand over support of the database servers in both Portland and Calgary to Paul Kane, as per his request,  but will still be happy to help out if it is required.

See ya

"RE:","cell number is:  512 3312 but it's enron's phone, so ...

home number is 262 0205 and cooper@llamacom.com should be a good place to reach me.

as for me, i'm very unsure.  I'm still technically a U.S. employee and my visa expires soon, 
so I really don't have any idea.  

worst case is i take a well-deserved vacation for awhile and worry about the rest later ... :)

Thank you very much, Cooper.  I appreciate that immensely, and you probably don't know exactly how much that means to me.

Do you have a cell phone number I could use, if it ever came to that?

What happens to you, if things pan out that way?  Are you able to change jobs up here, or is your work visa void if Enron Canada goes under?  I would gladly do the same for you.

Hi Chris,

I don't know where you're at with things ...

i've been impressed how you've handled both the databases and the people involved with databases and
would be happy to provide you with a solid reference if you ever need one.  please keep this to yourself
as I don't feel this way about many people here ...

cheers :)

"happy new year","hey greg, 

happy new year.  i can't remember when you were taking your trip to france, but i hope things are going well.  i'm back in town now after a long and peaceful break - mainly just waiting to see what happens to the enron trading operations.  

where did you buy the hardware when you built your servers?  i'm thinking of building a database server and am not sure if its best to mail order or buy in person somewhere in town.  

hope you're well and talk to you soon,

"RE: Friday Festivities","hi jill,

ah, i don't think you'll get this until next week, but maybe you're checking your email on the road.  hope your course is fun.  

how was it to see your family.  i've had my parents visit me up here and i was also down there over christmas break and i much prefer when they visit me rather the other way around.  i feel like i'm back in high school when i'm back home, i think, or something like that.  

don't tease me, what did you do on sat night?  

work is going really well - finally feeling some pressure.  

hmm, i don't know anything about painting pottery, but i'm interested. i've done it before and its harder than it looks and takes awhile, but could be fun with the right group of people.  

talk to you soon,
cooper

Hey Cooper, 
I hope you had a good weekend.  Emmy said you guys met up after I left.  My Friday wasn't a particularly exciting one.  I went out with the family (a five hour ordeal, for some reason my family is an anomaly when it comes to food consumption.  It's like being in the land of the sloth people).  Then I went home and crashed.  I made up for it on Saturday, which I regretted when I had to be up at 7am to see my dad off at the airport.
So, how's work going?  I'm busy b/c I'm going to be out of the office until Friday.  Their sending me to this gas marketing course for three days.  The itinerary doesn't look particularly exciting but I don't have to be there until 8am and I'll be done around 4pm.  It's sad that this is exciting to me.
So, I hear we're painting pottery?!  Are you going to come?  I have to admit its something I've never even thought of trying before but sounds like fun.  I'm not a very artistic person but I figure its hard to screw up painting pots.  But, you never know.
Have a great rest of your day 
jill

try having no work to do for two months and then having to stick around and 
""appear"" busy...  i know what you mean, in some ways its harder when you're 
not used to not doing things.  i've gotten good at finding things to do 
with my time, but when i first had nothing to do, i was going crazy. 
fridays are always slow around here and i'm guessing its the same there, 
although i don't know cnrl specifcally, oil and gas producer/marketer? 

in terms of what i do, before enron went under, i was the short term 
alberta power trader.  since then, i have been champion internet surfer and 
investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle.  although, 
things are looking up. 

eze is (i think) an earls nickname -- pronounced easy-e.  although, they 
may just call her easy for short.  i'm sure she loves both names very much. 

i have a very important meeting at 5 with my massage therapist and i was 
thinking about stopping by after that.  should i call eze's cell?  or do 
you have a cell #?

   You know what the worst thing in the world is?  Having no work to do on 
   a Friday but being unable to leave for hours.  I've been here for three 
   months and this is the first day where I haven't been busy.  This is a 
   Type A's worst nightmare.  E-mail is my sole consolation. 
   So what do I do, you ask?  I'm in Gas Operations, the marketer's right 
   hand man.  I do logistics, volume and supply/demand analysis, 
   nominations, monitoring of accounts, damage control...you know, more or 
   less hold the company together.  What exactly do you do over there? 
   Everyone always sees Emmy at Banana Republic.  She's a staple there. 
   Where did you get eze from?  I'm sure she loves it.  She never gets very 
   flattering nick names. 
   Well, I'm going to take off for lunch.  What time were you thinking of 
   coming down for drinks? 
   Talk to you soon

     let me know when you'er heading over to bass brothers and i'll meet up

     you - i have a few things to do but drinks after work should fit in.

        I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still

        to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed. 
        No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are

        town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've

        Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work. 
        You'll have to tell him I say hi. 
        I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my 
        part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing 
     most 
        of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers 
        tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming?

"RE:","yah, i'm looking forward to yoga.  i didn't do anything over break and was really looking forward to starting up my practice again and went several times as soon as i got back, but then i got sick, so ... i may try to take a nap this afternoon before yoga.  i'm very bad with directions.  i have the address at home and can call you with it, but basically, i go east on 12th Ave, turn right on (i think) 8th Street and then turn left on (i think) 24th Ave (there's an asian restaurant at this corner) and then it's up on the right side.  there's a big block of warehouse buildings.  it's a little complicated to find from here actually, maybe you should pick me up and we can go together?  

i don't really shop for ""yoga clothes"" partly out of some sort of philosophical resistance and also because the women's stuff is so much cooler than men's stuff that i don't want to bother.  

dude, that 6:00am yoga story is brutal!  YIM is going downhill - i don't think rockne can hold onto his good instrucors.  i hope core yoga stays solvent!

Hey Cooper, 
So are you getting ready for yoga tonight??  I'm really looking foward to it.  I haven't gone in over a week and I am having serious yoga withdrawl.  Did I tell you that I went, or I attempted to go,to a 6am yoga class at yoga in motion yesterday??  I psyched myself up to get up at 5:30am to go (which is extremly early when you start work at 8:30!) and the instructor never showed up.  So we all sat outside waiting. We all finally left and went home. So I got nothing accomplished.  I was tired,  but couldn't go back to sleep, and I didn't feel relaxed, as I usually do after a yoga practice.
Can you tell me where the Space is again???  I am meeting Jaimie after work at 5:30.  She has her car here,  so if you need a ride let me know.  I have to warn you...Jaimie is a brutal driver.  It's almost funny!
Not much luck finding yoga attire.  I have been to lululemon in Vancouver.  It's a super cool store.  Have you bought anything from there?  I regret that I didn't.....but now that I have internet access at work the possibilities are endless (not to mention, expensive!)
Enjoy the rest of your day!

"RE: are you there and okay?","hey!

sorry for the delay and thanks for thinking of me.  

i missed you at thanksgiving as well!  canadians celbrate thanksgiving
in october!?!, but some friends had me over for ""american"" thanksgiving,
so i had a good time anyway.  

i'm hoping to catch up with you and kt over the holidays.  i'm planning on
being on the east coast from dec 16 - jan 3, mostly in northern va.  are you
going to be in bethesda at all?  also planning a trip up to NY.  

yes, enron is in a bad way.  i'm doing fine, but it hasn't been a pleasant 
month at work with layoffs and massive uncertainty about future of the
company.  i've resolved to not worry about it until the new year and it seems
to be working!  still planning on staying in calgary but who knows?  

let me know about your holiday plans!  

love,
coop

remembered your email address correctly: we were so
sad to not see you at our ""regular"" thanksgiving time.
:(

going on with you? calgary? your job? your future?

we miss you!
love,
meg

Hi,

I work at Enron as a power trader and Gary Hagerty asked me to forward any prospects for a ""junior power risk management"" position at Epcor onto you. 

Michael Wong worked for us on booking the Sundance B PPA position and was let go soon after this was sold to TransCanada/Altagas and if you're still looking for someone, he would be worth investigating.  

Regards,
Cooper Richey
