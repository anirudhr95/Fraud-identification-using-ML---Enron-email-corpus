Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

"European Model Monday Evening","The European model, one of the ""major four"" models the market analyzes is in
and it shows generally mild conditions for much of the eastern interconnect
through the end of next week.
In fact, through at least 10 days, and probably beyond, this particular
model shows no sign of any major intrusions of cold air into the eastern
interconnect.

For the tropical feature in the Carribean, it brings the storm up along the
West Coast of Florida, just east of all the production areas this weekend
and stalls it out over the Southeast early next week meaning some rain
there.

We'll need to re-evaluate all of the models in the morning for the long
term, but at least for this evening this is a bearish weather picture
through next week from the European model.

See you all in the morning.

Dave

"RE: EPMI List Non terminated parties","1.  The cc'd individuals shown above are to be cc'd on each e-mail communication relating to terminations by the counterparties shown below which have not yet terminated. Communication on termination notices coming in should be made as soon as possible after receipt from the counterparty. Please try to assure that any termination notices reaching the 6th floor credit war room are brought to you ASAP for review.  Starting today, those counterparties shown in red may be receiving performance from EPMI on any given day going forward.  To serve our commercial purposes, we are hoping to get the time beween receipt of wholesale power side terminations and their review and internal acknowledgment on your spreadsheet and among the referenced persons reduced to a maximum of 24 hours.   

2.  I am confirming back to you that MidAmerican Energy Company has delivered to EPMI a 1-2-02 notice of termination, terminating effective 1-4-02 all wholesale power transactions under its Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement with EPMI dated 11-13-01. Please reflect this on your next issued spreadsheet.

Elevators and hemlines are hitting bold new heights and women are blazing smart new paths.  And now Millie Dillmount's arrived just in time to join the ""moderns"" and take the town.  Based on the 1967 Oscar winning film, Thoroughly Modern Millie is a valentine to the long-standing spirit of New York City and the people who seek to discover themselves there.

Subject:	GTC vs. Master

Kevin,

I was talking with Louise this afternoon and she said that she does not want us to put full master agreements online, but rather that we should proceed with streamlined GTC's in order to ensure that we are able to do as much business as possible without being delayed by negotiation of lengthy contracts.

This does not mean that we cannot ultimately get everyone onto a standardised long-form Master Agreement. EnronOnline is set up so that a negotiated Master Agreement will supercede the GTC.

"Free Grants For Those In Need!","$ * $ * $ * $ * HOTWEBCASH * $ * $ * $ * $

Have you been turned down from receiving a 
loan by a bank because of poor credit, no 
credit or bankruptcy?

Private Foundations are not interested in 
credit ratings, only demonstrated need.

IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE A GENUINE NEED, YOU 
CAN APPLY FOR A GRANT!

It is much easier to receive a grant by mail 
from a Private Foundation than a local bank, 
because they are much more lenient. Imagine 
getting a check, payable to you, in the mail! 
Money you never have to pay back!

WE WILL SHOW YOU HOW!

Energy Company Values Sink
In Response to Changing Times 



By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/rbellrgb100border.jpg>

Constellation Energy's (NYSE:CEG) shares fell nearly 11 percent on Friday in response to announcements that the company is cutting its earnings' projections, shelving plans to split the company into two parts, and severing its ties with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which would have been a minority partner in its energy-trading operation if the spin-off had gone ahead. 

Analysis: Constellation Energy's stock value dropped to its lowest level in seven years-down nearly 11 percent in one day, and down over 45 percent since May 1, 2001. But perhaps what is most important about Constellation is its shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the week to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts. Earlier in the week Allegheny Energy (NYSE:AYE) announced it would hold off on its planned initial public offering (IPO) of Allegheny Energy Supply Company, its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary, until market conditions improve. 

The dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same forces. Constellation sited falling energy prices, the changing nature of the California power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons for dropping its company-separation plans. The company said it would now focus on using its ""single"" status to leverage its balance sheet to participate in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United States. ""What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that comes from being a single company ? What has changed (in the last one year) is the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for new power plants ? the reasons are simple and profound. The world has changed,'' Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a conference call with the media. 

The change in Constellation's strategy will be costly. The company will pay Goldman Sachs about $355 million to terminate their power-marketing agreement, $159 million which Goldman had previously put in the business, and $196 million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business continued. Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will cause the company to record a $200-million special expense in the fourth quarter. The company said that its split-up with Goldman Sachs was amicable. Goldman's relationship with Constellation started in the mid-nineties when the investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the energy trading and marketing business. In 1999 Goldman agreed it would take a 17.5-percent stake in Constellation's trading business when the state of Maryland deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a separate trading company. Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want to be part of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain together. 

It certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other significant announcements concerning its future plans. Mayo A. Shattuck III was elected to the position of president and CEO effective Nov. 1, 2001. Shattuck recently resigned his position as chairman and CEO of Deutsche Banc. Alex Brown and has served on Constellation's board of directors for the past seven years. On Oct. 24, the New York Public Service Commission said it would approve the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating station in New York to Constellation Nuclear for $780 million. Constellation Nuclear is a unit of the Constellation Energy Group. As part of the sale, Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of Nine Mile's output at fixed prices for 10 years, or through August 2009 if the operating license of Nine Mile 1 is not extended. 

The unregulated generation and trading activities continue to drive the bulk of earnings for both Constellation and Allegheny. Constellation's domestic merchant energy business contributed $0.89 of their $1.00 earnings per share of common stock for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2001, slightly higher than last year when the business contributed $0.87 of the $0.98 per share in earnings for the same quarter. Allegheny Energy reported that their third-quarter profits more than doubled on increased generation capacity and the acquisition of a trading and marketing unit. Allegheny's third-quarter earnings were $1.33 per share, compared with $0.69 per share one year ago, and beating analysts' earnings of $1.10 to $1.28 per share. Allegheny is confident that its year-end earnings will be within its guidance range of $3.80 to $4.10 per share. 

Despite the strong earnings, Allegheny's stock price has dropped over 30 percent since May, and over 5 percent in the past 10 trading days. The drop in energy stock value appears to be driven by softening wholesale power prices. Earlier in the month Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate of Allegheny's 2002 earnings by 12 cents, to $4.03, citing reduced forward power price assumptions. 

The high-flying days of the recent past, where energy companies' price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples were exceeding 50 in certain cases, appear to be over. Many power producers are returning to their roots-scrapping plans for splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy and softening wholesale market prices. Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common themes affecting the industry: ""One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth."" 

AES Corp. (NYSE:AES ), apparently agrees. Its earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain and said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets. AES' Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AES was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business. By placing generating capacity into long-term contracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of flat growth. Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets were very low, allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for their product. But with the slowing economy, mild weather and consumer response to the higher prices, power demand for 2001 is flat or even down from one year ago in many parts of the country. 

The recent actions of Constellation, Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fundamental shift in the electric business. Their actions are, in some respects, a return to the past-companies striving for predictability and reliability in their power supply costs, profits and operations. Perhaps most significantly, companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to whether or not they will continue to be an integrated business. As Constellation concluded, one way to achieve and maintain a critical mass of business is to remain an integrated company. We would not be surprised if others come to the same conclusion.

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.
