Do you know if you're coming out yet? Got e-mails from
Lulenski (he's coming) and Sarhatt (he's not). I'm
planning to go to the beer bust and picnic for sure
and probably the Saturday night event if enough of you

Kevin,

This has to be one of the *ugly* games of the year.  The only saving
grace (and it isn't much of one either) is that the winner gets to say
they won their last game.  For Cal, that would be their only win.  I'm
going to be in OC at my in-laws, and I'm going to try to get an Internet
broadcast.

If Rutgers wins, I'll buy you a drink the next time I see you (actually
I'll buy you a drink regardless).  

Hi to Lisa - hope you guys have a Happy Thanksgiving.

C'mon you can play 18 then do housework all afternoon.  If you're just starting you don't get many invitations!  Truthfully, I'm usually napping after golf, you're always surprised how tired you get after 18 holes!

I've gotten some interest from various groups within EES, EGM and hopefully Industrial Markets, but it's tough.  Everybody is cautious, nobody's going gangbusters.  I've been pounding the pavement almost full time for 2 weeks.  Need to close something before heading back to Seoul.  I brought my family back to Houston and they're staying, but I'll head back to Seoul in a week or 2.

"Astros Game","Kamp,

Did you watch the Astros / Giants game last night.  It was embarrassing.  I've never
seen such a cowardly performance by a baseball team (of course I'm talking abt the
Astros).  When do you ever walk a guy with runners on 1st and 2nd, your team is 
down by 1 run and there is 2 outs?  Answer:  NEVER.  According to Dierker,
""... the critical walk was the one with runners on first and second,"" Dierker said. ""We did that because Jeff Kent was 3-for-17 against Williams and had struck out the last five at-bats (against him), so he showed some dominance against him. Obviously, you don't want to put another runner on base and move the runners another base in scoring position unless you have a very compelling reason, and we did.

How's long's this clown been managing.  I guess he hasn't followed Kent the last few years.  It wasn't like he was walking Bonds to get to 
Ivan DeJesus.  He doesn't even have the sack to admit he fucked up.  I've never seen fans boo their home team so much since the days of Michael Jack.

Have you and Patty been getting any sleep? How's Jack?

"RE:","Conway,

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.  

KR

"This Weekend","We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the upgrade to
the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the need to move
out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, besides this we
don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few hours on Sunday.

Let me know what you want to do.

AP Camden,NJ: A terrorist cell has been broken up in Camden just east of
Philadelphia. Four of the members have been apprehended by the Camden
Police, with the fifth still at large. Arrested in the Camden sweep were
Bin Eatin, Bin Smokin, Bin Sleepin and Bin Drinkin. All are being held on
illegal immigration
charges. Police stated that they can find no one fitting the description of
the fifth cell member, Bin Workin, in the area. But Camden Police are
confident that anyone who resembles Bin Workin would be easy to spot in
Camden.

Subject: Anderson '96 Reunion - 4 weeks away!


Dear Class of 1996,

**Note:  Response to this email requested, thanks!

Well, our much anticipated 5-year Reunion is less than a month away!  The
planning committe is working hard on the events, and we are trying to firm
up the list of attendees.  We got a GREAT response to the last email, thanks
for taking the time to let us know your status.  If you haven't responded
yet, please do so just so we can adequately reserve space.

Just to remind some of you, the event will take place on: *** November 2-4th
*** in Los Angeles, CA!   The rough schedule of events is shown below.  In a
subsequent email today or tomorrow we will provide some details about hotel
accommodations.  You will also be receiving an information packet from the
Alumni Office in a mailing that should be out next week.

If you are planning to fly I've heard there are some great deals on
Southwest and United among others (<$100 from SF).  Anderson Alums also get
a 10% on Southwest (see below)

If you would like to respond to this email regarding your status, please use
this form:

1) Status of your email account
	A)  Got this info - email address is correct
	B)  Got this info - but would prefer to use another address next time
	C)  I did not get this info (not sure how you would answer this, but...)

Note:  You may have received this note twice - it was sent to all members of
the Class of 1996 currently registered in the Alumni Database, as well as to
the Class of 1996 Email List (which is opt-in).

2) Plans for attending the Reunion Weekend
	A)  Will definitely be Attending
	B)  Will make a brief appearance (1 or 2 events)
	C)  Still Deciding
	D)  Will not be Attending (but wish I could)

3) Comments/Suggestions - Any thoughts on how to make this a GREAT reunion?

As mentioned previously, its been a rough year for many of us and it would
be great to end the year with some fun and good times!  I can tell you from
what we've been hearing, and from the number of responses received, that we
are going to have an awesome turnout for the events, so you don't want to
miss out!!!   So get your tickets, review your facebook (so who was that
Doug Dahl character anyways), dust off the old Anderson attire and let's
party!!

Sincerely,
Steve Smith
On behalf of Pete, Lynne, Melissa and many, many Reunion Organizers

There's been a lot of shit happening with my company and frankely,
I don't know what's going to happen over the next few months.  As a 
result, we decided to wait at least a few months until our financial
situation is better known.  

Glad to hear everything's going well.  Did you go out to California?
What are your plans over Thanksgiving?

Chump,

I've been super busy the last two weeks.  The pace seems to be cyclical and
we are definitely in high gear right now.  I don't expect it to slack off
until the Thanksgiving break with another push coming just before Xmas.  The
good news is, I am a third of the way through.

Did you ever get a car?

Dear Class of 1996,

**Note:  Response to this email requested, thanks!

Well, our much anticipated 5-year Reunion is less than a month away!
The
planning committe is working hard on the events, and we are trying to
firm
up the list of attendees.  We got a GREAT response to the last email,
thanks
for taking the time to let us know your status.  If you haven't
responded

Just to remind some of you, the event will take place on: *** November
2-4th
*** in Los Angeles, CA!   The rough schedule of events is shown below.
In a
subsequent email today or tomorrow we will provide some details about
hotel
accommodations.  You will also be receiving an information packet from
the
Alumni Office in a mailing that should be out next week.

If you are planning to fly I've heard there are some great deals on
Southwest and United among others (<$100 from SF).  Anderson Alums also
get
a 10% on Southwest (see below)

If you would like to respond to this email regarding your status, please
use
this form:

1) Status of your email account
	A)  Got this info - email address is correct
	B)  Got this info - but would prefer to use another address next
time
	C)  I did not get this info (not sure how you would answer this,
but...)

Note:  You may have received this note twice - it was sent to all
members of
the Class of 1996 currently registered in the Alumni Database, as well
as to
the Class of 1996 Email List (which is opt-in).

2) Plans for attending the Reunion Weekend
	A)  Will definitely be Attending
	B)  Will make a brief appearance (1 or 2 events)
	C)  Still Deciding
	D)  Will not be Attending (but wish I could)

3) Comments/Suggestions - Any thoughts on how to make this a GREAT
reunion?

As mentioned previously, its been a rough year for many of us and it
would
be great to end the year with some fun and good times!  I can tell you
from
what we've been hearing, and from the number of responses received, that
we
are going to have an awesome turnout for the events, so you don't want
to
miss out!!!   So get your tickets, review your facebook (so who was that
Doug Dahl character anyways), dust off the old Anderson attire and let's
party!!

"RE:","I think the only difference btw the 330Ci and the 330i is that the Ci
is a 2 door.  

Had a choice btw Wed and Thur game - chose Wed.  Not that disappointed
though as the Astros proved to be the biggest bunch of pussies in the
ML.  They were more concerned with not giving up a homer to Bonds than
with winning the game.  Now they stand a chance of not making the playoffs
at all.  If you ask me they don't deserve it and the mgr should be fired.

It was great to hear the fans booing the home team every other inning.  I'm
sure they lost a lot of fans over those 2 games.

Anyway, what's up on your front.  Are you still going out to Cali to visit
Hop and Denise?  How's flying?

I think the 330 is the better call.  You really don't want a BMW as a family

Subject: RE: 


Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you
will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).
Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you
drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end
power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of
the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a
bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank
(large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your
performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price
range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple
of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to
go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite
a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.
I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

"Re: Good Buying Opportunity????","Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think they are incable
of solving the problem.

Subject: RE: 


Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).  Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank (large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section

It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

*** Springsteen visits Jersey Shore club

ASBURY PARK, N.J. (AP) - A legendary Jersey Shore rock club had a
special guest at its birthday party over the weekend: Bruce
Springsteen. The Boss made a surprise appearance Sunday night before
about 2,500 fans at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park. The show, which
marked the one-year anniversary of the club's reopening, featured
another shore favorite, Southside Johnny and Asbury Jukes, and
rocker Graham Parker. Springsteen showed up on stage at about 8:40
p.m. and performed with the band and Parker for about an hour. The
set featured several Springsteen songs and some Southside staples,
along with a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Born on the
Bayou.""

"Good Buying Opportunity????","Stamos,

I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to get 
crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that is in cash.
The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase in
plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates but there'll
be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've just seen the beginning.  
I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.

Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis is not a short term
problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that state's economy goodbye.
Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate prices in the country, and 
(2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst of a hi-tech meltdown, what would
keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  If you own any
CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply.
Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue likely won't be solved anytime
soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so high that
the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cutting
back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours.  California will see
this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses have
closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the blackouts will get much worse.
If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas, I would bet it will go
bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy 
of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keep my eyes on
the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care and thanks for the email.

"Re: Portable Generator","Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

"RE: What's up with your company?!","I think Enron is going to $10.  I've been quite concerned for
the last month+.  It looks like a number of the senior execs have
done some questionable acts.  It's been quite the moral buster.  They
need to clean shop and get rid of the CEO and entire board for
letting these types of actions occur.  We will never regain investor
confidence until this occurs.  

The problem with ENE is that we make an incredible amt of money on 
the wholesale side of the energy business (natural gas and power) but
we have thrown money at a myriad of bad businesses that lost lots of
money (Azurix water co., broadband, residential marketing.  They need
to get someone in here that will eliminate these losers and focus on
the core businesses.  In my opinion, some of these execs, former and current,
should go to jail.  It's amazing how a group of guys could ruin a great 
company.  I'm sure there will be a grad school case study and a book
written about this.  I'm sure it will be a best seller.

Anyway, let me get off my soapbox.  I'm glad to hear you got a new job.
That would be great if Chris gets the package and looks for something
more enjoyable.  Congrats to you brother and make sure you tell your
folks I was asking about them. 

Lisa and I haven't finalized any plans to NJ in Jan but I'll let you
know as soon as we do.  We're both looking forward to hooking up
with you guys.

Conway won't have to go overseas.  He said he's the last one they'll
activate.  His cell phone # is 240-298-7007.  I have to look for his 
email but i'll let you know when I find it.  

Take care and good to hear from you.

Dude,
Good thing I took some of my Pru 401K $$ and bought Enron in February, when
I opened my roll-over IRA.

Besides the job how's everything else going with you and the lovely Lisa?

Things could not be more hectic over here. I'm switching jobs next month.
Gave the dot.com world a shot and timed it wrong. When the company you are
working for is borrowing $$ from the VC to meet payroll and has not locked
in the final round of funding, you know it is time to move along. Will be
joining a NY Real Estate Brokerage House, where I'm friend with the guys.
Will be helping them run their Corporate Service Group.

Lets see what else is going on.

Chrissy is trying to decide if she is going to volunteer for the Merrill
Lynch layoff package that is being offered. I want her to, because her boss
is making her life miserable.

My father had triple by-pass surgery last month. He is doing fine now and it
is probably for the better in the long run that he had the procedure done.

And on good note- My brother got engaged.

I lost Mr. Conway's tele # and email address, can you shoot it over to me.
Would like to drop him a message. Is he still State side? hopefully.

Remember to drop me a note when you finalize your visit back to NJ in
January, so we can hook up.

Tell Lisa and the family that we send our regards,

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

"RE:","Great to hear from you.  Glad to know everyone's doing well.
Did you know Moller was going to be on TV or were you just channel

Work's going OK.  ENE stock has been getting destroyed.  A lot
of negative press abt management.  I would sell your shares if
you still have them.  It's $30 right know but I have a feeling 
it's going lower.  Tell Dave also if you talk to him.  News has
been coming out that I wasn't aware of.

Anyway, Lisa's job is going great - she's really happy.  We haven't
been up to a lot lately - just hanging around the neighborhood.

The anthrax scares and the terrorist stories are really scary.  What
a bunch of nuts we have living in this world.  I have a feeling it
could get worse before it gets better.  Don't open any letters from
unknown companies or counterparties.  Take care of yourself and Gloria
and Tommy.  Tell them we said hi and we'll talk to you soon.

Yo Kev,

What's happening? Hope everything is going okay. How is Lisa and the rest of 
the neighborhood?

It's starting to get cold here. The temperatures are in the high-40's.
Went to Notre Dame last week with dad. It was cool. The campus was 
beautiful; the ride wasn't that bad; and the people were REAL nice (how 
weird?!).

Anyway, dad had a good time, except I think he got pneumonia on the trip. 
""Mr. Sunshine"" was dressed up in shorts and a golf shirt for a mid-October 
trip to Indiana. It was 75 degrees when we left Jersey and 45 degrees by the 
time we hit the Ohio border. He can't figure out how he got pneumonia (true 
story). Anyway, I saw him yesterday and he looks and sounds better.

Anyway, Gloria is busy coaching soccer. Her team is 9-4-1 (best record in 
school history). Tommy is busy causing havoc wherever he goes (Takes after 
mommy). His grandparents are driving mommy and daddy nuts (same ol' story).

I hope everything is going all right. Heard the big lobsterfest was a 
success (Nothing like a FRESH Maine lobster). Belated congrats on your first 
anniversary.

Is life pretty tense at Enron (with all the craziness of the world markets, 
terrorism scares and this Anthrax hysteria)? Do you have to go through a 
metal detector or anything like that?

Anyway, I saw Moeller was on TV. Never thought I'd be happy to see his ugly 
mug on the toob!

Well, I've got to go (I'm at work). Talk to you soon.

Love your brother,

PS. Mom and Dad are looking forward to THANKSGIVING with you and Lisa! (Some 
fun, eh?!)

Take care

How's everything going -I assume great?  How's the baby and Patty
doing?

How 'bout that Barry Bonds?  You must be in heaven - (1) baby boy,
(2) Yanks win the division, (3) Bonds goes for record.

I think Bonds is going to break the record Wednesday night in Houston.
Guess who'll be sitting in section 154 (check it out on the Astros
website) waiting for # 71.  Look for me on TV.

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.  Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.  I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be

looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Some idiot lost a pair of pliers so I have to wait around to go fly.  I
guess it's just as well, I'd hate to find them at 3,000'.

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed one
record.

I don't have TJ's email w/ me, but I'm sure he never expected you to
actually show up in the first place.

Conway,

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.  

KR

Fag boy,

Let me know if you are definitely canceling for Cali so I can set up
other
plans.
