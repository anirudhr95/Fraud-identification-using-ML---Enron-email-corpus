For whatever reason (lower prices maybe?), we have experienced a huge increase in customer buying activity.  Other than the real small guys, we have been doing about 40 to 50 contracts a day of terms 1 to 5 years.  Today we have booked 112 and they continue to come in as I write.  If you are interested in our customer activity, let me know.

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd
Sun	11/18	52 Bcfd

"Mandatory Harassment Avoidance Training","
Harassment Avoidance Training

To contribute our personal best at Enron, our conduct must promote respectful and co-operative work relationships.

During this training you will:
Be able to recognize harassment
Learn to take precautions against being harassed
Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
Know how to address a situation involving harassment
Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with Enron Values

Go to <http://elm.enron.com> to sign up for the session of your choice.  Harassment Avoidance is listed in the Compliance Category.  If you have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713-853-0357.

"Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","
The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

================================== 

Who We Are

Cornerstone Research is a leading financial/economic 
consulting firm that specializes in providing attorneys 
with expert testimony and economic and financial analyses 
in all phases of commercial litigation. Our staff of more 
than ninety consultants works closely with prominent 
faculty at many top universities.  Our work includes 
developing economic and financial damages models,

Cornerstone is involved in a broad variety of cases.  We

development of an industry, determine the effects of a 
firm's activities on its competitors, and research 
historical merger and acquisition events.  Our work has 
involved highly visible events and legal issues.  Some of 
our recent cases have examined the failures of many 
Internet high-tech ventures, the collapse of the savings 
and loan industry, price fixing, insider trading, and large
corporate mergers.  Our clients come from a variety of 
industries, such as commercial and investment banks, 
consumer goods producers, and leading technology and 
telecommunications firms.
For further details, check our website at 
http://www.cornerstone.com/

Associates at Cornerstone

Associates are central to case work at Cornerstone.  In the
initial stages, associates actively participate in the 
formulation of the work plan and the analysis of issues.  
As the case progresses, associates handle the complex 
aspects of a case directly, while managing and advising 
analysts.  They work with senior staff, experts, and 
clients to develop case strategy and to determine how best 
to communicate our findings.  An associate's 
responsibilities include:
? Identifying key economic and financial issues
? Conducting in-depth research and analyzing relevant data
? Creating analytical frameworks, and building economic and
financial models
? Presenting complex findings to counsel
? Participating in the preparation of expert reports, 
declarations, and other work product

Company Culture

We provide friendly and cooperative working environment.  
Even with the significant growth over the last couple of 
years, we have maintained a non-hierarchical collegial 
culture.  We recruit associates with a long-term 
development perspective instead of 'up-or-out' mentality.  
Associates are encouraged to take initiatives and 
leadership roles in both case work and company business 
development.

Candidate Profile

Our current associates and managers include MBAs from 
Stanford, Chicago, Duke, Wharton, Yale, Carnegie Mellon, 
etc.  The ideal candidate should have the ability to 
develop structured case-cracking strategies and creative 
solutions, present concise explanations of complex 
analyses, and independently manage projects and junior 
staff.  Candidates should have strong background in 
finance, accounting, or economics, as well as strong 
communication and writing skills.  We offer 
industry-competitive compensation.
Interested candidates should send a cover letter which 
includes your location preference (we have offices in Menlo
Park, CA, Boston, MA, New York, NY and Washington, D.C.),

"RE:","Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).  Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank (large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

What do you think about the 530?  Isn't it basically the same thing
as the 330 except it's bigger?  If so, does it handle as well with the
added size and weight?

Kev,

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.
I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

Subject: RE: 


I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

kevin

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of
a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and
a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed
one

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

"EFCU E-Survey Response","
Enron Federal Credit Union
E-Survey Response

We recently asked you to participate in the EFCU 2001 E-Survey.  More than 3,000 Enron employees took the time to respond to our survey.  Your honest opinions and time are appreciated and will help us continue to bring you products and services that you deem important in your life, as well as the service that you expect.

We are pleased to report these areas where you have had a positive experience (based on Good, Very Good, and Excellent ratings), in comparison to last year's ratings:

				2001	2000
	Friendliness		88%	84%
	Courtesy		89%	84%
	Knowledge/Training	86%	80%
	Range of Services	87%	82%
	Saving Interest Rates	66%	60%
	Loan Interest Rates	65%	58%
	Quality of Service	88%	84%
	Communications	84%	79%
	Web Portal		72%	N/A
	Service Wait Time	79%	68%


Of course, there is always room for improvement.  Based on your written comments, we have determined these areas where we would like to improve:

ATM Access - We are working with various vendors to develop a program that offers you more free ATM access options and hope to be able to offer this program soon.  We will let you know as soon as a program is available.  In the meantime, members are encouraged to get cash one of these ways to avoid fees:

-  Use your VISA Check Card to get cash back at merchants.  These are fee-free transactions.
-  Use our ATM in the lobby of the Enron Building or 3 Allen Center, or try the approximate 100 fee-free ATMs in the Houston area that display the Select ATM logo (visit enronfcu.com for locations).	
-  Visit one of our Service Center branches (visit enronfcu.com for locations).
-  We will also waive our fee on 3 unaffiliated ATM transactions per month.


Phone Accessibility - In January 2001, we established a phone center to answer incoming calls to our main number.  An automated system initially prompts you, but the option to speak to a live operator is available.  Your call may be forwarded to an EFCU representative, and you may get voice mail.  In this instance, we will return your call as soon as possible.

Should you get voice mail, it will help us process your request more efficiently if you leave your name, phone number, member number and the nature of your call.  You may also contact us via e-mail at efcu@enron.com, and we will respond as soon as possible.


Wait Lines - Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we are unable to expand our financial services area (new accounts) right now.  We do recognize that this does at times cause a back up and apologize for the inconvenience.  We are making plans to expand when possible.

We added several tellers this year to help the traffic flow in the teller area and are now filled to capacity at all stations.  As you know, the teller lines are sometimes heavy on paydays.  To help minimize your wait time, here are a few other options to handle your transactions:

-  Make deposits & withdrawals at our ATMs in the Enron Building Lobby or 3 Allen Center.  Deposits are retrieved between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and are posted the same day.
-  Make deposits at our Night Drop Box on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, outside of the EFCU front doors.  The Night Drop Box is checked throughout the day and transactions are posted the same day if received by 5:00 p.m.
-  Sign up for Direct Deposit.  It's convenient, fast and safe.  Go to ehronline.enron.com to sign up.
-  Sign up for QuickLink - Internet Account Access.  QuickLink is free and allows you to verify cleared checks and posted deposits, transfer funds and more, all from the convenience of your computer.  Sign up at enronfcu.com.
-  Sign up for QuickTeller - Automated Phone System.  QuickTeller is also a free service that allows you to perform all of the same functions as QuickLink, but by telephone.  Go to enronfcu.com to sign up.

Thank you again for your feedback.  We look forward to the opportunity to bring you more of the latest financial services as they become available in the market.

"SchwabFunds Enables Shareholder Money Funds Transactions","Dear Schwab Client:

As of Thursday September 13, 2001, SchwabFunds(R) Money Funds will
be open for Shareholder transactions and will continue to be

"Your Role in Computer Virus Protection","As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.

Subject:	Var Calc

Bharat,

I feel that my var has been overstated recently due to my recent purchasing
of gulf area basis.  As I've bought, my var has continued to increase dramatically.
I'm not sure of the reason, but typically gulf area basis rarely moves.  A $0.005
move is a rather dramatic move for example.  I spoke to Frank and he recommended
that I contact you so that you can do some investigation.  Below I've listed some of
the points I'm concerned with.  Please let me know your findings as soon as you can or
stop down (3233C) if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

"Blood Drive Update","Wow!  Enron employees and other Houstonians are showing such generosity!  

The response to the blood drive has been outstanding.  Employees from Continental Airlines and other surrounding corporations have come to our blood donation site to give.  Blood Center personnel have informed us that because of the overwhelming response donations are now being taken on a first-come, first-served basis.  The Blood Center is attempting to keep appointments on schedule.  However, we ask for your patience and understanding if there is a delay. 

It is indeed gratifying to witness your continued generosity to the community and beyond.

"Sunday 12/18/01 WX 4KZ","Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:

Here's the cars I'd look at if I were you.

Acura 3.2 CSL
330i Coupe
Passat V6
Volvo S-80 or S-60 w/ twin Turbo
Audi A4/A6
Maxima (whatever the top of the line is - always top rated by Car and
Driver)

If you want American Iron, I'd look at the Chrylser 300M.  My uncle is a
huge driver and loves it.

At Andersen, we have transformed our Assurance offerings to
help you meet important new challenges in these times of

focused on risks and controls.  It is assurance for the new
economy.  Our Business Audit methodology begins by 
understanding a clients' business context and identifying 
business risks - the root causes of financial reporting 
surprises, misstatements and errors.  Once we have 
identified the risks, we focus on assuring the quality of 
key controls, so that our clients have confidence in the 
information they rely on to run their business, that that 
others rely on to invest in it.  We are enthusiastic about 
the role of assurance and its ability to deliver value to 
business leaders and the investing public.  Assurance is a 
growing business at the heart of Andersen.  For every 
client and company, it is a fundamental and increasing need.

"","How was your little grab ass weekend with the Angel of Death?  Sorry to hear
about the house, I know what a bummer it is to lose a contract.  Hopefully
someone else will come along and take it off your hands.  Are you still
considering renting it or are you committed to selling?

My sister gave birth last weekend to a little boy, however he was about 4
months premature.  We're all pulling for him but it is still touch and go at
this point.

School is challenging but interesting and the flying is awesome so I'm
pretty happy.  Bought a used BMW motorcycle yesterday - a '71 off of the
original owner.  It's a classic and will give me something to tinker with on
the weekends.

Hope all is well,

"RE: Var Calc","Hi Kevin,

I have looked into your VaR question and, I don't think that your Var incerase is related to your Gulf Area Basis positions.  

Between the 13th and the 16th of July you bought about (484) fixed price contracts.   You went approx 4bcf shorter NYMEX, which increased your Var from about $500,000 to about $1,500,000 ($1 mm increase from one day to the next).  Between the above mentioned days the NYMEX prompt price fell approx 17 cents.  Yesterday you again seemed to have added about (3) bcf of NYMEX shorts on a down move of 14 cents in the prompt. MERC Prompot Vols are about 60%.....

So that's my take.......
I will look further into the problem if you still want me to.

Hope that helps

Thanks

Bharat

Bharat,

I feel that my var has been overstated recently due to my recent purchasing
of gulf area basis.  As I've bought, my var has continued to increase dramatically.
I'm not sure of the reason, but typically gulf area basis rarely moves.  A $0.005
move is a rather dramatic move for example.  I spoke to Frank and he recommended
that I contact you so that you can do some investigation.  Below I've listed some of
the points I'm concerned with.  Please let me know your findings as soon as you can or
stop down (3233C) if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

"RE:","Kev,

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.  Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.  I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

Subject: RE: 


I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Later,

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of
a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and
a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

"Important Message","It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall.  I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.  JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is ""Mission: Possible"" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.  In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer.

Thank you very much for your support.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

"Code of Ethics -- What Exactly Did I Agree To?","

How well do you know our Code of Ethics?

""It is a condition of employment that each employee accept the responsibility of complying with the foregoing policies.  The Company will require each employee of the Company to complete and submit a statement in a form designated by the Company pertaining to such employee's compliance with the policies set forth in this booklet.  The Company reserves the right to request any employee to complete and submit such statement at any time or as frequently as the Company may deem advisable.""
(Enron Code of Ethics, July 2000, page 62)

What does that mean?

In layman's terms, everyone employed by Enron agrees to all the policies and standards listed in the current Code of Ethics (July 2000).

Who does it apply to?

The Code of Ethics applies to all employees, third party contractors, guests and licensees of Enron.  Additionally, employees are responsible for their family members and/or personal household who use, own, or have access to Enron's communication services and equipment -- including telephones, fax machines, computers, computer modems, long distance telephone services, cell phones, voice mail, pagers, e-mail, mail and delivery services.

What about my privacy?

Don't expect privacy when using Enron's equipment or services -- whether the activity is business or non-business related.  For example, don't use Enron's equipment to send or receive personal messages that you don't want monitored or accessed by the government, third parties or Enron.  In a nutshell, if you want privacy, don't use Enron's equipment.

Are there repercussions for non-compliance?

Yes.  An employee who violates any of the policies in the Code of Ethics is subject to disciplinary action, including suspension or termination of employment, and can include legal action if Enron believes it to be appropriate under the circumstances.

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin the week of October 15th.
Two schedules are being offered:
	Course # 7129-00:  Tuesdays, Oct 16 - Dec 11 (no class Nov 20)
	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)
PLEASE NOTE that the two schedules are not interchangeable; employees should
enroll in their preferred schedule and stick to that schedule.

Course details:
	- Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron employees
	- Each course is limited to eight students
	- Meets once a week for eight weeks
	- Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
		include initial exam)
	- Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
	- Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
	- Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
		GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
	- Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition
Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"", 
			please indicate either course #7129-00 (Tuesdays) or # 7129-01 (Thursdays).  
If you wish, you may indicate one course as your first choice and the other as your second choice.
		C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
			tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.  
			FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is required on the registration form.  
			Be sure to indicate complete cardholder information.
	3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be honored.  
Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on awaiting list for the course or courses indicated.
Enrollments and waitlists will be confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
The next courses at the Princeton Review office start the week of October 20.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

"New Legal Team to Assist RAC","	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!
