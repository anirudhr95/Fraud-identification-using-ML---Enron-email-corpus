                        that's your fault.  you were taking up over half of

      you

Matt,
To refresh your memory from Friday night, I got laid off and am doing independent work right now.  Although the money is good, the stability is a factor. So, if there is anyone you might know at Enron to help me get an interview for that associate program, I would appreciate it.  My resume is attached.  Thanks for helping me out.  Take care.
DAS
 
P.S.  LSU preseason ranked #8 in CBS Sportsline power poll.  Not sure how I feel about that.

thoughtful! The article said that considerable pressure was exerted by the
trading department. Were you in on any of it? Hooray for the trading

Where do you think we'll have the most fun? That's what's really important.
If you think Austin will be more fun, then maybe we should go.

                                       you to move over.  and then you kept

                                       waking me up. so, i did not sleep
   well.
         you
                  probably
                        slept
                              better

Since work has gone to hell, I am hoping to find some excitement in the possibility that LSU may play in the Cotton Bowl (if Rohan ""Alabama"" Davey shows up for
the next 3 games.)  However, do not purchase tickets until it is a done deal - a lesson I learned following the Ark game last season.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
LSU's famed `Death Valley' is a fraud
Mike Bianchi
October 5, 2001
It happened yet again earlier this week. The talking heads on one of the
sports networks came on and started previewing Florida's game at LSU on
Saturday and, sure enough, the first words out of Pavlov's mouth were
these:
""Tiger Stadium might just be the toughest place in the nation to play.""
Give that man a liver snack.
This is my No. 1 pet peeve in all of sports: the perpetual misinformation
and baseless genuflecting at the mere mention of LSU's ""Death Valley."" The
three biggest myths in popular world culture are, in reverse order: 3. The
Loch ness Monster. 2. The Skunk Ape. 1. LSU's home-field advantage.
Why is it that magazine after magazine and commentator after commentator
insist on perpetuating the biggest fish story in college football? Sport
magazine named Tiger Stadium ""the most feared road-playing site in
America.""
Gannett News Service named Tiger Stadium the ""most dreaded"" road site in
America. Just last week, ESPN.com did a poll asking respondents to name the
five college football venues they would most like to visit. The choices:
Michigan, Notre Dame, Tennessee, Nebraska and LSU.
Are you kidding me? Putting Tiger Stadium on a list with other such
legendary football destinations is like conducting a poll of the great
vacation destinations and offering up these choices: Hawaii, Orlando,
Tahiti, Las Vegas and Scranton.
Do the people who conduct these polls actually -- I don't know -- pay
attention! You want to know how intimidating Tiger Stadium is?
* LSU's home record against Alabama the past 16 years is 1-15-1.
* LSU's home record against SEC teams the past 10 years is 18-21.
* LSU's home record against Florida's past two football coaches (Galen
Hall and Steve Spurrier) is 1-6. It's so easy to win at LSU that Hall beat
the Tigers 16-13 in 1989, and UF officials were so impressed they fired him
the next day.
Actually, LSU barely plays better at home than it does away. That 18-21 SEC
home record over the past decade is only barely better than its 15-23-1
road
mark.
Has any venue been more of a one-hit wonder than Tiger Stadium, which has
been living off Billy Cannon's famous 1959 punt return for nearly a
half-century now? Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods had Billy Don't Be a Hero;
LSU had Billy Do Be a Hero.
Not just anybody goes into Tiger Stadium and wins; everybody and his
brother
does. UAB did last year. Houston did in 1999. In the past three years, Ole
Miss, Alabama, Auburn, Florida and Georgia have. Are we leaving anybody
out?
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot: Kentucky has, too.
ESPN college football analyst Lee Corso says it's not Tiger Stadium that's
so tough; it's Tiger Stadium at night that's so tough. ""If you check it out
over the last few years, I'll bet you they win eight out of 10 home games
at
night,"" he said.
Not so fast, my friend.
""Well, then, how about seven out of 10?"" Corso said.
Wrong again.
In the 1990s, LSU was 35-21 at home at night; that's barely six out of 10.
And a lot of those victories came against moonpies such as Arkansas State,
Western Carolina and Pinky's Cosmetology Institute.
Its name is Tiger Stadium; they should call it Pussycat Pavilion.
Opponents call it Death Valley; they should call Life Blood.
It's time to stop spreading the biggest lie in all of sports. That Tiger
Stadium mystique everybody talks about is really nothing more than a Tiger
Stadium mirage.

I think we should dig up that slip that Matt Hersh gave to Max saying that
he might have been exposed to an STD and then get the photo of his cock in a
doughnut to complete the circle.  Has anyone fwded that mail to Coco?  I'm
sure she has a couple fond memories for the two of them to savor throughout
their marrige.

Subject:	Lousyanna State vs. Texas - Pretenders vs. Contenders

Well, Well, Well,
I am writing this note to all the smack talking coonass LSU fans who enjoy
banging on The University of Texas Longhorns with smug smack like
""Overrated, Overrated"".
I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody
won't get barraged with weak Reply All's from recipients who think they can
go toe to toe with me in e-mail smack (i.e. Val and his weak shit he likes
to send).
This time is different because I think y'all should know who your fellow
pathetic smack talking LSU fans are.
Y'all can start a new support group - called ""Vassigh's College Football
Smacked down Bitches - that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms, Cedric
Benson, and Roy Williams et al""
Y'all have dished it all out, so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into
the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night.

Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajun's
included in this e-mail header.
   ""Simms sucks, how could he be a preseason heisman candidate?"" - Over his
   last three games, Simms is 59-of-88 (67.0 percent) for 698 yards and 12
   touchdowns passing 2 touchdowns rushing with just one interception
   (176.41 rating).  He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of
   games recently and is coming into his own.  Simms will be a top NFL pick
   as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson.  I can't think of any College
   Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has
   with Simms, Benson, and Williams.
   ""The SEC is the best conference in football, the Big XII Sucks"" - What a
   joke that statement is.
   ""LSU would whip UT""  - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice.
   ""UT is the most overrated team in college football"" - interesting since
   they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason
   polls.
   ""Mack Brown can only recruit - he can't coach worth a damn - Nick Saban
   is better"" - Mack Brown has one loss - he hasn't lost in Austin since he
   has been coach - while Saban has led LSU to three losses - 2 in the Red
   Stick - just THIS SEASON.

Every college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the
Big XII.
The BIG XII have 3 TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP 5 early November - unbelievable!
Two of the top ranked BIG XII team's only losses were to the other top
ranked BIG XII school.  UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska.
The only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play
against each other.
The highest ranked SEC team (Florida) lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic
Arkansas.

All football players worth a damn have left y'alls God Forsaken state.
Peyton to Tennessee, Marshall Faulk to SDSU, the newest Manning to Ole Miss
that just whipped up on y'alls 3rd world state university in the Red Stick
on national television on a cool October Saturday night.
Cajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play
college ball though - that's some encouraging news for y'all.
I can't think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL.
NFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State
football player.
David Lafleur, Kevin Faulk, Harvey Williams, Eddie Kennison - the list goes
on and on.  It is really pathetic.
Texas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky, Tony
Brackens, Dan Neil, Shaun Rogers, Leonard Davis, Priest Holmes, Blake
Brockermeyer, Bryant Westbrook, and many others.  Look at Eric Metcalf in
his first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records.
Texas players are magic baby.
Not to mention legends like the Tyler Rose, Tom Landry, Bobby Layne, and
Tommy Nobis

I hope y'all enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while y'all attend
Lousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl.
At least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like
offense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God
willing with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of
OU and some other help - watch UT vs. Miami in the Rose Bowl.

I guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems
pretty foolish to you now doesn't it.
That dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL.  He might
have a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket,  The difference between
how Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night
showed LSU's deficiency at the QB position.  Fumbling, bumbling, stumbling
is the best way to describe his play.

CKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store
because you need to save your money to pay on the $500 bet you made with me
the night of Val's wedding in that little bar in Natchez, Mississippi.  You
boldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night, since
all you were ranting was ""tiger bait, tiger bait"" any time I was trying to
tell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the 3 lesser ranked teams have
already done this season.
The bet for $500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher
at the end of the 2001 College Football season: Me = University of Texas
You =  LSU.
Well since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not
finish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even
finish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash
- or we can work out an installment plan.
Lenhart was a witness as well was another of Val's amigos (I forgot the
name but know the face).

It looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of
Texas always being superior in every facet over it's little cajun neighbor
to the east - Lousyanna.
Texas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys, the 3
time champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns.
Conversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints,
and the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university.
The last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader
of the free world.
The last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreaux's balls for
the next 15 years or so.
And the bottom line is that y'all are in my State working because there are
no jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna

Even the only bright spots in the pathetic history of y'alls only
professional sports franchise is provided by Texas players - Earl Campbell
and Ricky Williams.

He who laughs last laughs best.
Man this note is a classic.  I think I will be sending it to Jim Rome.

Hook 'Em

Val forward this note all over the Red Stick and all over that God Forsaken
land east of the Sabine.
The Truth shall set your people free.

Brian

What are you doing this weekend?  
I'm going to Austin this afternoon. 
My friend, Erika, (that moved to N.Y.) will be there and I'm going to hang out with

Mike Ecklund.  Kate is the blonde that used to hang out with me a lot. 
Get this - Kate was dating a guy from Austin for about a year and she moved there 2 months ago. 
Well, he just dumped her.  Can you believe that?  He begged her to move there and she doesn't 
know anyone else there. 
Anyway, she is pretty upset - so i'm going to party with her this weekend.

Watch the Tigers Maul Middle Tennessee State!
LSU vs. Middle Tennessee State - November 10th, 2001 @ 7:00pm
Since the game is only available via satellite, come out and watch the game
at Woodrow's!

(For those who can't make Woodrow's, Nick's Place will also show the game)

(Note that parking will be available in the office building next door as
well as the normal areas - coming from Richmond, go past the office
building next to Woodrow's and take a right to get to the parking garage.
Parking is available for cars and small SUV's - due to clearance
restrictions, large vehicles are not allowed to park in the garage)

we are finished.  i need to now get a job at house of pies b/c that is the only way to pay the bills.  the economy is down and when enron collapses, the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt.  not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks.  can't go to anymore lsu games unless i get a free ticket.

Since work has gone to hell, I am hoping to find some excitement in the possibility that LSU may play in the Cotton Bowl (if Rohan ""Alabama"" Davey shows up for

Matt,

Enclosed is a spreadsheet for you to review. It details the charges
TransCanada has assessed to Enron for nonperformance on business
conducted at PGT Malin and PG&E Citygate for the month of May.

If you have any questions give me a shout at (403) 920-5020.

Thanks,

what, did you not mean to cc: me on that?  

anyway, about the girl.  i dont know why i dont think she is your type.  the more i think about it the more i notice that you really dont have a type - so who knows.  the game was good, we lost 6-2.  4 of the padres runs were homeruns. we suck.

Lets try to replay MLK day at Front Porch Sunday night.  Unfortunately it will probably be crowded since everyone has Memorial Day off.

Hey there....thanks for your concern for my friends & family after the
tragedy...everyone is okay, thank G-d...how about your friends?  I have one
sister in DC & one in NYC, so it was a pretty traumatic week, but everyone
is okay & that is what's important.  Alli (my sis in NYC) happened to be at
a meeting on Wall Street that morning, so she was 2 blocks away & was
covered in debris running from the building, so she will probably need
therapy like the rest of Manhattan!

On a happier note...thanks for forwarding that email to the ushers...did
you get the $160 rate with our block of rooms when you reserved your room?
As far as the tux goes..when we go to Miami in October to finalize
everything, Max will send the guys the form for the tuxes to return your
measurements to the place in Miami & you guys will go get fitted & pick
them up on Thurs. afternoon or Fri. morning before the wedding....I dont
know what Max has planned for you guys on Friday...who are you sharing a
room with?  :)  Stacey is probably going stag....just kidding....

We went to a wedding this weekend & watched the best man make a speech &
Max & I just cracked up because all we could do was picture your speech!  I
have faith that you'll deliver a beautiful speech, right????

Hope all is well there...when are you moving here to collect your
""wingman""?

Take care,
Jen
The Bride :)

SPORTS COMMENTARY
LSU's famed `Death Valley' is a fraud
Mike Bianchi
October 5, 2001
It happened yet again earlier this week. The talking heads on one of the
sports networks came on and started previewing Florida's game at LSU on
Saturday and, sure enough, the first words out of Pavlov's mouth were
these:
""Tiger Stadium might just be the toughest place in the nation to play.""
Give that man a liver snack.
This is my No. 1 pet peeve in all of sports: the perpetual misinformation
and baseless genuflecting at the mere mention of LSU's ""Death Valley."" The
three biggest myths in popular world culture are, in reverse order: 3. The
Loch ness Monster. 2. The Skunk Ape. 1. LSU's home-field advantage.
Why is it that magazine after magazine and commentator after commentator
insist on perpetuating the biggest fish story in college football? Sport
magazine named Tiger Stadium ""the most feared road-playing site in
America.""
Gannett News Service named Tiger Stadium the ""most dreaded"" road site in
America. Just last week, ESPN.com did a poll asking respondents to name the
five college football venues they would most like to visit. The choices:
Michigan, Notre Dame, Tennessee, Nebraska and LSU.
Are you kidding me? Putting Tiger Stadium on a list with other such
legendary football destinations is like conducting a poll of the great
vacation destinations and offering up these choices: Hawaii, Orlando,
Tahiti, Las Vegas and Scranton.
Do the people who conduct these polls actually -- I don't know -- pay
attention! You want to know how intimidating Tiger Stadium is?
* LSU's home record against Alabama the past 16 years is 1-15-1.
* LSU's home record against SEC teams the past 10 years is 18-21.
* LSU's home record against Florida's past two football coaches (Galen
Hall and Steve Spurrier) is 1-6. It's so easy to win at LSU that Hall beat
the Tigers 16-13 in 1989, and UF officials were so impressed they fired him
the next day.
Actually, LSU barely plays better at home than it does away. That 18-21 SEC
home record over the past decade is only barely better than its 15-23-1
road
mark.
Has any venue been more of a one-hit wonder than Tiger Stadium, which has
been living off Billy Cannon's famous 1959 punt return for nearly a
half-century now? Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods had Billy Don't Be a Hero;
LSU had Billy Do Be a Hero.
Not just anybody goes into Tiger Stadium and wins; everybody and his
brother
does. UAB did last year. Houston did in 1999. In the past three years, Ole
Miss, Alabama, Auburn, Florida and Georgia have. Are we leaving anybody
out?
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot: Kentucky has, too.
ESPN college football analyst Lee Corso says it's not Tiger Stadium that's
so tough; it's Tiger Stadium at night that's so tough. ""If you check it out
over the last few years, I'll bet you they win eight out of 10 home games
at
night,"" he said.
Not so fast, my friend.
""Well, then, how about seven out of 10?"" Corso said.
Wrong again.
In the 1990s, LSU was 35-21 at home at night; that's barely six out of 10.
And a lot of those victories came against moonpies such as Arkansas State,
Western Carolina and Pinky's Cosmetology Institute.
Its name is Tiger Stadium; they should call it Pussycat Pavilion.
Opponents call it Death Valley; they should call Life Blood.
It's time to stop spreading the biggest lie in all of sports. That Tiger
Stadium mystique everybody talks about is really nothing more than a Tiger
Stadium mirage.

Elizabeth,
For Jan 20-22, 2001, PG&E paid a fixed price of $10.50/mmbtu for an ENA gas sale on SITARA #576162.
We show the price should be fixed at $12.35/mmbtu.  The difference amounts to a $22,338.75 underpayment.
Please advise.
Thanks,
Doug

   I sold out on Saturday. I got called by work right after I talk to you

   didn't get off my cell until after halftime. I missed the entire first

   Good thing no one rode with me. I had to stay in C-town last night until

   Also, I may be fucked for next weekend too. Let me know if you are

I am watching the fourth quarter of the 9th Ranked Texas Longhorn as
whipping of the 14th ranked Colorado Buffalo.
I am very dissapointed - I had one of my to-do's this week was to send you
a note to take another $100 of your dollars by giving you the 10 points -
it looks like you would have needed 30+ though.
Either CU is OVERRATED or more like The Horns are some bad ass hausses.
The truth is that The Horns can beat any team in the nation any weekend.

I would enjoy the ass-whipping the Horns would lay on the Cajun Bitches
from the Red Stick (lsu sucks).

I guess being a Colorado Coonass means you get punked by the Horns twice -
CU and Lousyanna State both being inferior to the Horns.

Subject:	Holiday Party - Canceled


I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Subject:	Liquidated Damages Pertaining to May 11 Gas Day


	Matt

	I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the
firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not
perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend
traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in
the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I
would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is
not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm
as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and
Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a
serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the
California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had
a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can
regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be
sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.

	Thanks

Subject: New Darwin Award winners are in...



They have finally been released!  For those not familiar with the Darwin
Award, it's an annual honor given to the person who provided the
universal human gene pool the biggest service by getting killed in the
most extraordinarily stupid way.  As always, competition this year has
been keen again.  Some candidates appear to have trained their whole
lives for this event!

THE RUNNER-UPS

1.  Detroit - A 41-year-old man got stuck and drowned in two feet of
water after squeezing head first through an 18-inch wide sewer grate to
retrieve his car keys.

2.  San Francisco - A 49-year-old stockbroker, who ""totally zoned when
he ran"" according to his wife, jogged off a 100-foot high cliff on his
daily run.

3.  Buston, NC - a man died on a beach when an 8-foot-deep hole he had
dug into the sand caved in as he sat inside it.  Beachgoers said Daniel
Jones, 21, dug the hole for fun or for protection from the wind, and had
been sitting in a beach chair at the bottom when it collapsed, burying
him beneath 5 feet of sand.   People used their hands and shovels,
trying to claw their way to Jones, a resident of Woodbridge, VA, but
could not reach him.  It took rescue workers using heavy equipment
almost an hour to free him while about 200 people looked on.  Jones was
pronounced dead at the hospital.

4.  Lompoc, CA - Santiago Alvarado, 24 was killed as he fell face-first
through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he was burglarizing.  Death was
caused when the long flashlight he had placed in his mouth rammed into
the base of his skull as he hit the floor.

5.  Dahlonega, GA - ROTC cadet Nick Berrena, 20, was stabbed to death by
fellow cadet Jeffrey Hoffman, 23, who was trying to prove that a knife
could not penetrate the flack vest Berrena was wearing.

6.  Selbyville, DE - Sylvester Briddell, Jr., 26 was killed as he won a
bet with friends who said he would not put a revolver loaded with four
bullets into his mouth and pull the trigger.

7.  Windsor, Ontario - Daniel Kolta, 27, and Randy Taylor, 33, died in a
head-on collision, thus earning a tie in the game of chicken they were
playing with their snowmobiles.

8.  Taos, NM - A woman went to a poison control center after eating
three birth-control vaginal inserts.  Marie Valishnokov (who spoke
little English) thought the inserts were candy or gum, being unable to
read the foil wrappers. After the third one, she realized something was
wrong with her throat and her mouth began to fill with a sour-tasting
foam.  She ran for the Poison Control Center where doctors were able to
flush the foam from her mouth, throat and stomach with no ill effects.

9.  La Grange, GA - Attorney Antonio Mendoza was released from a trauma
center after having a cell phone removed from his rectum.  ""My dog drags
the thing all over the house,"" he said later.  ""He must have dragged it
into the shower.  I slipped on the tile, tripped against the dog and sat
down right on the thing."" The extraction took more than three hours
because the cover to Mendoza's phone had opened during insertion.  ""He
was a real trooper during the entire episode,"" said Dr. Dennis Crobe.
""Tony just
cracked jokes and really seemed to be enjoying himself.  Three times
during the extraction his phone rang and each time, he made jokes about
it that just had us rolling on the floor.  By the time we finished, we
really did expect to find an answering machine in there.""

10. Bremerton, WA - Christopher Coulter and his wife Emily were engaging
in bondage games when Christopher suggested spreading peanut butter on
his genitals and letting Rudy, their Irish Setter, lick them clean.
Sadly, Rudy lost control and began tearing at Christopher's penis and
testicles. Rudy refused to obey commands and a panicked Emily threw a
bottle of perfume at the dog.  The bottle broke, covering the dog and
Christopher with perfume. Rudy leaped back, tearing away the penis.
While trying to get her unconscious husband in the car to take him to
the hospital, Emily fell twice, injuring her wrists and ankle.
Christopher's penis was put in a Styrofoam ice cooler.  ""Chris is just
plain lucky,"" said the surgeon who spent eight hours reattaching the
penis.  ""Believe it or not, the perfume turned out to be very
fortuitous.  The high alcohol content, which must have been
excruciatingly painful, helped sterilize the wound.  Also, aside from it
being removed, the damage caused by the dog's teeth to the penis per se
is minimal.  It's really a very stringy piece of flesh.  Mr. Coulter
stands an excellent chance of regaining the use of that limb.""
Washington Animal Control has no plans to seize Rudy.

AND THE WINNER

Paderborn, Germany - Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt fed his
constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more than a
bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged-up pachyderm
finally let fly and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop.
Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give the
ailing elephant an olive-oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on
him like a dumptruck full of mud.  ""The sheer force of the elephant's
unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he
struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued
to evacuate his bowels on top of him.

"","Coach Jim Haslett had put together the perfect
New Orleans Saints team.
The only thing he was missing was a good quarterback.

He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools,
but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback
who could ensure a Super Bowl win.

Then one night, while watching CNN,
he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia.
In one corner of the screen,
he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly
incredible arm.
He threw a hand grenade straight
into a 15th-story window 200 yards away
--ka-boom!

""I've got to get this guy!""  Haslett said to himself.
""He has the perfect arm!""
So, he brings the kid to the New Orleans
and teaches him the great game of football,
and the Saints go on to win the Super Bowl
for the first time in history.

The young Bosnian is ""canonized""
as the Great Hero of football,
and when Haslett asks him what he wants,
all the young man wants to do
is to call his mother.
""Mom,"" he says into the phone,
""I just won the Super Bowl.""
""I don't want to talk to you,"" the old woman says.
""You deserted us.  You are not my son.""
""I don't think you understand, Mother!"" the young man pleads.
""I just won the greatest sporting event in the world.
I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.""
""No, let me tell you,"" the mother retorts.
""At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us.
The neighborhood is a pile of rubble.
Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday,
and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight.""
The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says ""
 ...I'll never forgive you for making us move to
New Orleans.""

   Are you going in or stay here? May not be bad to save a trip since it is
   supposed to rain (50%) during the game. Then again, if we win, it would

               yes, you have to type in her name where it says search and
   then
         her
            site
               will come up.  it is definitely her b/c that picture you
   sent
      me
         is
            on
               it.

Lenny! jumping in the conversation without missing a beat....good to have
you with us. Nice comedy....but the only fat, bald 30 year old is the
Dogger. (just kidding dog, you's not fat....you's just fluffy). Don is
bald, but not fat. Roby is balding, but just a little ""stocky"". Clint has a
belly, but is not balding. Other than that, we are all pretty normal
(please use that term loosely).

Your parents would love to have us at their crib. Dog could rummage through
all of your belongings, eat all of your parents' food, and wake them up at
the ass crack of dawn with scrambled eggs and jumby. Roby could show your
mom ""a good time"". Porteous, Clay, and Myers could talk to your dad about
his company's legal shortcomings. Bernie could sell you all some much
needed life insurance. Clint could smoke, and Dehart could clear his lungs
so that he could ski without falling dead on the slopes. Gooch could lend
Don the money to build an addition to your maw's bathroom (so that Dog and
Roby could smell it up). And Naquin could try to get with your sister, take
notes of the whole weekend's proceedings, and make copies for all of us to
remember them by.

Porthole....see if Timmy, Tricia, Mike Thomas, etc. would be interested in
going on the trip...Lenny....see about all of your Houston Fiji buddies
(house bitch, Tim, Val, etc.). Tell Tim we'll let him bring his new wife
with him, too, although that might mean that there could be up to 3 Phi
Mu's on the trip....quorum could be met, and ""the Phi Mu Crew"" might be in
full effect; God help us.

Clint, what about Freret and Dawn (that might make 4 Mu's)?

Anyone else we can think of who might be interested in this trip (Jan 10 -
14th)?

IN THE MONEY: Enron Transparency Not Transparent Enough
By Michael Rapoport

11/08/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

   A Dow Jones Newswires Column


  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- So Enron Corp. (ENE) says it wants to be more
transparent - to make its impenetrable financial results and corporate
structure easier for investors and analysts to understand.
  Based on its announcements Thursday, however, it still has a heck of a
long way to go.

  With Enron's restatement Thursday of nearly five years' worth of
earnings and additional information about the maze of off-balance-sheet
deals related to it, we now have a lot more information about the mess
at Enron than we had 24 hours ago. But we're not much closer to
understanding just what HAPPENED to leave Enron in such a mess - and
that's because the company's explanations of all this continue to be
dense, confusing and next to impossible to grasp.

  Try this tidbit, from the Form 8-K Enron filed about the restatements
Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission:

  ""In addition, Enron's net income is reduced for specific JEDI revenues
previously allocated to Chewco, relating to the appreciation in value of
Enron stock, which eliminate upon consolidation. This, in effect,
reduces Enron's share of JEDI's earnings.""

  Huh? And no, it doesn't help you to know that ""Chewco"" is an entity
that wasn't included in Enron's financial results but which Enron now
admits should have been. Or that ""JEDI"" isn't a ""Star Wars"" reference
but a limited partnership in which both Enron and Chewco had invested.
It's still impenetrable.

  Then there are the times when Enron just plain doesn't give enough
information. The company says its decision that Chewco should be
included in its results after all ""is based on current information that
Chewco did not meet the accounting criteria to qualify as ...
unconsolidated..."" Uh - okay. WHY didn't it meet the criteria, and why
did Enron previously believe that it did? Enron doesn't say.

  Finally, Enron makes some assertions that just make you scratch your
head. The company says part of the restatement of its earnings stems
from unspecified ""prior-year proposed audit adjustments and
reclassifications which were determined to be immaterial in the year
originally proposed.""

  Hmmm. Beyond the fact that Enron doesn't elaborate on the nature of
these ""audit adjustments and reclassifications,"" or why they were
originally considered immaterial, consider that according to Enron's own
figures in the 8-K, they add up to a negative earnings impact of $87
million since 1997. That amount doesn't sound like any definition of
""immaterial"" I've ever heard.

  An Enron spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

  In fairness, this lack of clarity may be all but inevitable given
Enron's Byzantine structure, which involves dealings with outside but
related entities that also have third parties involved, which in one
case have a subsidiary that allowed Enron to hedge the risks of an
investment, and in another case is selling assets purchased from Enron
to OTHER entities in order to finish paying Enron for the original
transaction, and ... you get the idea. It's next to impossible to make
clear because Enron's structure is just too baroque to understand in the
first place.

  The market is plenty puzzled by all this, even in the wake of Enron's
attempt to clarify things. Take a look at the company's drunken-sailor
stock chart from Thursday. After news of the restatements hit, Enron
stock first jumped higher, going as high as $10 a share, then soon
dropped back, to as low as $8.40, as investors started to digest the
details of the news. Then up again to about $9.25, then down again to
its current level of around $8.50.

  There's no reason investors should be confused like this. There is
absolutely no reason that a reasonably intelligent layman, with an
elementary working knowledge of corporate finance, should be unable to
understand the regulatory filings, structure, earnings and balance sheet
of any public company.

  If that's happens, it's the company's fault, not the investor's -
either because the company hasn't explained things well enough or
because its structure is needlessly complicated to begin with. If Enron
wants to get back the market's confidence, fixing that problem, one way
or the other, would be a good place to start.

"FW: Holiday Party - Canceled","i guess i won't take paige to this

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of Ken Lay- Chairman of the Board & CEO@ENRON
Sent:	Monday, November 19, 2001 3:35 PM

Subject:	Holiday Party - Canceled


I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

   Boone will be pissed if we take off. He wants to booze on Saturday and
   Sunday.


   Where do you think we'll have the most fun? That's what's really
   important.
   If you think Austin will be more fun, then maybe we should go.

Well, Well, Well,
I am writing this note to all the smack talking coonass LSU fans who enjoy
banging on The University of Texas Longhorns with smug smack like
""Overrated, Overrated"".
I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody
won't get barraged with weak Reply All's from recipients who think they can
go toe to toe with me in e-mail smack (i.e. Val and his weak shit he likes
to send).
This time is different because I think y'all should know who your fellow
pathetic smack talking LSU fans are.
Y'all can start a new support group - called ""Vassigh's College Football
Smacked down Bitches - that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms, Cedric
Benson, and Roy Williams et al""
Y'all have dished it all out, so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into
the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night.

Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajun's
included in this e-mail header.
   ""Simms sucks, how could he be a preseason heisman candidate?"" - Over his
   last three games, Simms is 59-of-88 (67.0 percent) for 698 yards and 12
   touchdowns passing 2 touchdowns rushing with just one interception
   (176.41 rating).  He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of
   games recently and is coming into his own.  Simms will be a top NFL pick
   as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson.  I can't think of any College
   Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has
   with Simms, Benson, and Williams.
   ""The SEC is the best conference in football, the Big XII Sucks"" - What a
   joke that statement is.
   ""LSU would whip UT""  - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice.
   ""UT is the most overrated team in college football"" - interesting since
   they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason
   polls.
   ""Mack Brown can only recruit - he can't coach worth a damn - Nick Saban
   is better"" - Mack Brown has one loss - he hasn't lost in Austin since he
   has been coach - while Saban has led LSU to three losses - 2 in the Red
   Stick - just THIS SEASON.

Every college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the
Big XII.
The BIG XII have 3 TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP 5 early November - unbelievable!
Two of the top ranked BIG XII team's only losses were to the other top
ranked BIG XII school.  UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska.
The only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play
against each other.
The highest ranked SEC team (Florida) lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic
Arkansas.

All football players worth a damn have left y'alls God Forsaken state.
Peyton to Tennessee, Marshall Faulk to SDSU, the newest Manning to Ole Miss
that just whipped up on y'alls 3rd world state university in the Red Stick
on national television on a cool October Saturday night.
Cajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play
college ball though - that's some encouraging news for y'all.
I can't think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL.
NFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State
football player.
David Lafleur, Kevin Faulk, Harvey Williams, Eddie Kennison - the list goes
on and on.  It is really pathetic.
Texas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky, Tony
Brackens, Dan Neil, Shaun Rogers, Leonard Davis, Priest Holmes, Blake
Brockermeyer, Bryant Westbrook, and many others.  Look at Eric Metcalf in
his first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records.
Texas players are magic baby.
Not to mention legends like the Tyler Rose, Tom Landry, Bobby Layne, and
Tommy Nobis

I hope y'all enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while y'all attend
Lousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl.
At least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like
offense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God
willing with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of
OU and some other help - watch UT vs. Miami in the Rose Bowl.

I guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems
pretty foolish to you now doesn't it.
That dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL.  He might
have a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket,  The difference between
how Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night
showed LSU's deficiency at the QB position.  Fumbling, bumbling, stumbling
is the best way to describe his play.

CKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store
because you need to save your money to pay on the $500 bet you made with me
the night of Val's wedding in that little bar in Natchez, Mississippi.  You
boldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night, since
all you were ranting was ""tiger bait, tiger bait"" any time I was trying to
tell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the 3 lesser ranked teams have
already done this season.
The bet for $500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher
at the end of the 2001 College Football season: Me = University of Texas
You =  LSU.
Well since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not
finish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even
finish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash
- or we can work out an installment plan.
Lenhart was a witness as well was another of Val's amigos (I forgot the
name but know the face).

It looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of
Texas always being superior in every facet over it's little cajun neighbor
to the east - Lousyanna.
Texas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys, the 3
time champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns.
Conversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints,
and the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university.
The last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader
of the free world.
The last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreaux's balls for
the next 15 years or so.
And the bottom line is that y'all are in my State working because there are
no jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna

Even the only bright spots in the pathetic history of y'alls only
professional sports franchise is provided by Texas players - Earl Campbell
and Ricky Williams.

He who laughs last laughs best.
Man this note is a classic.  I think I will be sending it to Jim Rome.

Hook 'Em

Val forward this note all over the Red Stick and all over that God Forsaken
land east of the Sabine.
The Truth shall set your people free.

Brian

"RE: What happened on Monday","sorry about that.  we were running so late and we couldn't find green.  we did turn south and drove around until 12:30 and figured we were too late.  i figured your phone died.  we ended up at memorial and i played like shit.  i was so dead from the night before.  i should have slept all day.  we can tee them up sometime soon.

Subject:	What happened on Monday

Monday was a complete wash.  I got there at 12:00 and only 2 others were there.  When I talked to you and you said you were on your way, we hung up and my phone died.  I tried to remember any number I could to try and get a hold of you, but I always use speed dial and don't know any numbers.  Boone has a private number.  I got your message on my voice mail at 12:30, but you didn't leave a number.  I think I know where you guys went wrong with the directions.  I bet you went south on JFK instead of north.  The first light you come to on the north side is Greens.  Then you take a right and it's a 1/4 mile on the right.  We will plan another outing, but at a course you know how to get to.

By the way, I shot a 92.  I was so hung over I was sweating scotch.  I did drive a par 4.  Was about 340 yards (missed the eagle, got the par).

      sure 
            what 
               is going on there. 
               We'll have to come up with a costume if we go out.

nobody speaks english, dirty, high crime rate.  We'll probably be at a
resort though so it won't matter.  If you like the big discoteque dance
clubs then it's your place, which I'll bet you do.  I'd rather lay back in
the caymans, and I've never been there.  I'm getting old I think.

does miami suck?  i haven't ever been there.  i have been to caymans and

   she called me.  she keeps in touch with me.  she spilled the beans on
   the
   plans to move the wedding.  i think if we went to cayman we would spend
   over a grand each.    miami will rock.

Subject:	Re: Death Valley

Let me start off by saying YOU MYOPIC, NEARSIGHTED LITTLE FUCK.  Have you
ever been to Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night?  Have you ever heard the
Tiger Band from Tigerland play as the Tigers take the field?  Were you not
there in 1997 when we beat the shit out of the then ranked #1 Florida
Gators?  If you didn't write about sports, would you still feel like a man?
I bet the answer to all of these questions is a resounding NO.  You never
hear any other columnists or coaches banging on other venues within their
conferences because of the respect and pride they have of their own
conference.  You don't deserve the SEC and you don't deserve to write about
it.

I hope you are at the game Saturday night.  Win or lose, a few things will
definitely happen.  1)Before the game, you will get a rush hearing the Tiger
band make their way to the stadium.  2)You will get a rush when the Tigers
run out on the field.  3)You will hold your ears like a pussy when you hear
a crowd like you've never heard before.  4)And lastly, you will wish you
went to LSU.

Fellas, I'm pretty much having the most difficult week of work I've ever
had, so I propose that we drink heavily Friday night . . . I think this is
a wise choice to ensure that our livers don't go into shock due to a lack
of alcohol in our system . . .

            over
               half
                  of

                                          you to move over.  and then you
   kept

                                          waking me up. so, i did not sleep
      well.
            you
                     probably
                           slept

   Get us a tee time today. I'm game for Saturday afternoon as well. Maybe
   at
   Clear Creek since we haven't been there in a while and it may not be
   crowded.

   I'll call you when I get home @ 6p.

Subject:	Lousyanna State vs. Texas - Pretenders vs. Contenders

Well, Well, Well,
I am writing this note to all the smack talking coonass LSU fans who enjoy
banging on The University of Texas Longhorns with smug smack like
""Overrated, Overrated"".
I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody
won't get barraged with weak Reply All's from recipients who think they can
go toe to toe with me in e-mail smack (i.e. Val and his weak shit he likes
to send).
This time is different because I think y'all should know who your fellow
pathetic smack talking LSU fans are.
Y'all can start a new support group - called ""Vassigh's College Football
Smacked down Bitches - that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms, Cedric
Benson, and Roy Williams et al""
Y'all have dished it all out, so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into
the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night.

Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajun's
included in this e-mail header.
   ""Simms sucks, how could he be a preseason heisman candidate?"" - Over his
   last three games, Simms is 59-of-88 (67.0 percent) for 698 yards and 12
   touchdowns passing 2 touchdowns rushing with just one interception
   (176.41 rating).  He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of
   games recently and is coming into his own.  Simms will be a top NFL pick
   as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson.  I can't think of any College
   Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has
   with Simms, Benson, and Williams.
   ""The SEC is the best conference in football, the Big XII Sucks"" - What a
   joke that statement is.
   ""LSU would whip UT""  - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice.
   ""UT is the most overrated team in college football"" - interesting since
   they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason
   polls.
   ""Mack Brown can only recruit - he can't coach worth a damn - Nick Saban
   is better"" - Mack Brown has one loss - he hasn't lost in Austin since he
   has been coach - while Saban has led LSU to three losses - 2 in the Red
   Stick - just THIS SEASON.

Every college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the
Big XII.
The BIG XII have 3 TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP 5 early November - unbelievable!
Two of the top ranked BIG XII team's only losses were to the other top
ranked BIG XII school.  UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska.
The only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play
against each other.
The highest ranked SEC team (Florida) lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic
Arkansas.

All football players worth a damn have left y'alls God Forsaken state.
Peyton to Tennessee, Marshall Faulk to SDSU, the newest Manning to Ole Miss
that just whipped up on y'alls 3rd world state university in the Red Stick
on national television on a cool October Saturday night.
Cajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play
college ball though - that's some encouraging news for y'all.
I can't think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL.
NFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State
football player.
David Lafleur, Kevin Faulk, Harvey Williams, Eddie Kennison - the list goes
on and on.  It is really pathetic.
Texas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky, Tony
Brackens, Dan Neil, Shaun Rogers, Leonard Davis, Priest Holmes, Blake
Brockermeyer, Bryant Westbrook, and many others.  Look at Eric Metcalf in
his first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records.
Texas players are magic baby.
Not to mention legends like the Tyler Rose, Tom Landry, Bobby Layne, and
Tommy Nobis

I hope y'all enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while y'all attend
Lousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl.
At least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like
offense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God
willing with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of
OU and some other help - watch UT vs. Miami in the Rose Bowl.

I guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems
pretty foolish to you now doesn't it.
That dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL.  He might
have a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket,  The difference between
how Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night
showed LSU's deficiency at the QB position.  Fumbling, bumbling, stumbling
is the best way to describe his play.

CKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store
because you need to save your money to pay on the $500 bet you made with me
the night of Val's wedding in that little bar in Natchez, Mississippi.  You
boldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night, since
all you were ranting was ""tiger bait, tiger bait"" any time I was trying to
tell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the 3 lesser ranked teams have
already done this season.
The bet for $500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher
at the end of the 2001 College Football season: Me = University of Texas
You =  LSU.
Well since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not
finish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even
finish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash
- or we can work out an installment plan.
Lenhart was a witness as well was another of Val's amigos (I forgot the
name but know the face).

It looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of
Texas always being superior in every facet over it's little cajun neighbor
to the east - Lousyanna.
Texas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys, the 3
time champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns.
Conversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints,
and the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university.
The last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader
of the free world.
The last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreaux's balls for
the next 15 years or so.
And the bottom line is that y'all are in my State working because there are
no jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna

Even the only bright spots in the pathetic history of y'alls only
professional sports franchise is provided by Texas players - Earl Campbell
and Ricky Williams.

He who laughs last laughs best.
Man this note is a classic.  I think I will be sending it to Jim Rome.

Hook 'Em

Val forward this note all over the Red Stick and all over that God Forsaken
land east of the Sabine.
The Truth shall set your people free.

Brian

I don't know if you've seen it yet, but one of the programmers that works
for me burned me a copy of XP a couple of weeks ago . . . don't really know
how he got his hands on it, but it's pretty cool . . . I have to upgrade my
burner software due to compatibility issues . . . is your burner software
Roxio?  If so, I need you to burn me a copy . . . I'll burn you a copy of
XP if you're interested . . . the first 64 byte OS

Subject:	RE: Nick's bachelor party. Who's in?

We are planning on doing Nick's bachelor party this Friday night in NOLA. He
has a wedding shower on Sat. night and I am trying to see who all is going
to be able to make it. I know there has been a lot of wedding stuff going
on, but this is still Nick's turn and I hope that if you could be there then
you will be there. The tentative schedule is to start off with some
Monsoon's at Port of Call then go to Harrah's for a little while and
eventually hit Larry Flynt's Hustler Club. I need to get an accurate count
of who is going to make it in. Please send me a response on whether you will
be in attendance or not as soon as possible.

Thanks,

"Re: (no subject)","i cannot go to denver the last week of may b/c i have to be here for work.  the last week is when we set gas prices for the next month.  i think the best thing for me to do is come to phoenix one weekend.  i have been golfing lately.  i got a lesson and the teacher gave me a new swing.  i am kind of struggling with it now.  i think it will take me to the next level.  i will try to call you and grandma this weekend.

Subject: Dear Abby.......



Dear  Abby , 
I met Laurie at a singles dance.  I knew as soon as I looked at her that she 
was too young for me. I'm 49 and she was 32 , 17 years my junior. I really 
regretted it because we got along so well that evening. She made me feel so 
comfortable in her presence.  Our age difference didn't seem to matter to 
her as much as it did to me. 
Abby, I told her I felt people were staring at us.  I said they are probably 
wondering if I am your father.  She thought I was being silly and said if I 
wanted to see her again she would be honored to go out with me. 
Laurie and I have been dating now for three months.  I really like her and I 
think she likes me.  Still, everywhere we go, I feel people watching us. 
Sometimes they just outright stare.  It is very annoying and I know it is 
because of our age difference that draws these prolonged looks from everyone 
we meet.  I just feel so uncomfortable about this whole thing and wonder if 
I should continue with the relationship. Why do people have to be so 
rude....? 
Sincerely, 
John 
PS: I have attached a picture of Laurie.

               no problem.  instead of a golf allowance though, i think
   i'll
      just
            get
               you a
               membership somewhere.  wouldn't that be better?  just let me

            i
               can
               arrange it.

         nobody speaks english, dirty, high crime rate.  We'll probably be
   at
      a
         resort though so it won't matter.  If you like the big discoteque
      dance
         clubs then it's your place, which I'll bet you do.  I'd rather lay
      back
         in
         the caymans, and I've never been there.  I'm getting old I think.

         does miami suck?  i haven't ever been there.  i have been to
   caymans
      and
         they are awesome.  it is really laid back and very expensive.
   either

Subject:	BBall 2-on-2 Tournament

1st Annual 2-on-2 Basketball Tournament

When:          November 17th @ 11AM

Where:         4527 Holly St.
          Bellaire, TX 77401

Details:       It will be a 2-on-2 tournament at my house starting around
11AM.  I should have college football games on all day in the house.  LSU,
UT, and A&M are all off that weekend.

I'm supplying all the gatorade, ice, and anything else we may need.  Bring
$5 to pay for the gatorade and whatever is left over can buy beer/go to the
winners.

We will not setup teams.  You either come with your partner or come hoping
that someone else needs a partner, too.

It will be a double-elimination tournament on a 8 1/2 or 9 ft. goal and
scoring will go as follows: to seven by ones, winning by two or first to
ten points to keep games moving.  We may need to put a time limit on games
if we have too many teams.

If someone has an old TV that they can bring over, we can put it on in the
garage in the backyard.

If you want to reply to me, please don't reply to all.  This invitation is
not limited to people in the cc: field, but please don't invite another ten
people.  We should have enough teams.

Call me, or send me an email, if you have any questions.

Thanks -

As gameday approaches I'm seriously considering driving in for the game Sat
morning . . . Everyone I know is gonna be in BR this weekend . . . It's
going to be an awesome game and BR will be fun as hell sat night . . . I
think Hull is leaning toward doing that as well . . . why don't you suck it
up and come along for the ride . . . we've got 4 tix between Mitch, You,
Hull, and me, so we're covered there . . . we can stay at my buddy's house
who lives right off Acadian . . . There will be a ton of hot ass very drunk
in BR . . .

Also, I've got a hot friend who lives in Atlanta that I'm thinking about
flying up to see . . . she wants me to come in for the Auburn/Georgia game
in Athens on Nov. 10 . . . they're taking a bus from Atlanta to Athens and
back . . . you interested?

I sold out on Saturday. I got called by work right after I talk to you and I
didn't get off my cell until after halftime. I missed the entire first half
to of the game. Do you know if Boone or anyone taped it? Did you get a
stripper to go back to your place with you?

Good thing no one rode with me. I had to stay in C-town last night until
8:00p.

Also, I may be fucked for next weekend too. Let me know if you are staying
here. After next weekend, I'm coasting for work until next year.

no, that's wrong.  you just kept saying one rude thing after another which
bothered me.  it doesn't matter.  the point is that it should not be so

 only one thing i said was rude, which i apologized for, and you wouldn't
let it die.  most of the stuff was started by you.  you were just venting
frustration you weren't able to communicate when you're sober.

hey there- how's it goin?

4th st. is sort-of away from all the college
crowd...it's pretty cool, i like it.  if you were to go
to 6th. 'the library' & 'the aquarium' are good
places. 'touche' is also pretty cool (flaming dr.pepper
gimick).
i work at 'lbjs broadcasting' there are six radio
stations in the building. i work specifically for
101X.  it is an alternative rock station.  i also make
some commercials; if you listen to the radio here-
that's me talking on the 'showpalace' & 'expose'
commercials.- yes- they are strip clubs.(no
affiliation) it also airs on 93.7fm.
how's it goin in the arm-pit of america?

 THE GOLFING NUN
A nun is sitting with her Mother Superior chatting.
""I used some horrible language this week and feel absolutely terrible
about it.""
""When did you use this awful language?"" asks the elder.
""Well, I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like it was
going to go over 280 yards, but it struck a phone line that was hanging
over the fairway and fell straight down to the ground after going only
about 10 yards.""

""Is that when you swore?""
""No, Mother,"" says the nun. ""After that, a squirrel ran out of the
bushes and grabbed my ball in its mouth and began to run away.""

""Is THAT when you swore?"" asks the Mother Superior again.
""Well, no."" says the nun. ""You see, as the squirrel was running, an
eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and
began to fly away!""

""Is THAT when you swore?"" asks the amazed elder nun.

""No, not yet. As the eagle carried the squirrel away in its claws, it
flew near the green and the squirrel dropped my ball.""

""Did you swear THEN?"" asked Mother Superior, becoming impatient.
""No, because the ball fell on a big rock, bounced over the sand trap,
rolled onto the green, and stopped about six inches from the hole.""

The two nuns were silent for a moment. Then Mother Superior sighed ands
said, ""You missed the fucking putt, didn't you?""

   you

      nobody speaks english, dirty, high crime rate.  We'll probably be at
   a
      resort though so it won't matter.  If you like the big discoteque
   dance
      clubs then it's your place, which I'll bet you do.  I'd rather lay
   back
      in
      the caymans, and I've never been there.  I'm getting old I think.

      does miami suck?  i haven't ever been there.  i have been to caymans
   and
      they are awesome.  it is really laid back and very expensive.  either
      place
      will be fun, i just think miami  will be a better night life.

         she called me.  she keeps in touch with me.  she spilled the beans
   on
         the
         plans to move the wedding.  i think if we went to cayman we would
      spend
         over a grand each.    miami will rock.

   and

Please trade smaller in the future.  You are doing a great job making the markets  PG&E and Malin, but your positions are getting too large.  Do not stop yourself out today in one move, but rather begin a methodical plan to reduce your risk.  Make a move to get closer to your VAR.

You are the King.

Are you going in or stay here? May not be bad to save a trip since it is
supposed to rain (50%) during the game. Then again, if we win, it would be
one that I'd be pissed for missing. If you drive in, my mom will have some
gumbo for us on Sunday.

daily dose on enron - 

we are finished.  i need to now get a job at house of pies b/c that is the only way to pay the bills.  the economy is down and when enron collapses, the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt.  not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks.  can't go to anymore lsu games unless i get a free ticket.

Since work has gone to hell, I am hoping to find some excitement in the possibility that LSU may play in the Cotton Bowl (if Rohan ""Alabama"" Davey shows up for
the next 3 games.)  However, do not purchase tickets until it is a done deal - a lesson I learned following the Ark game last season.

         on
            the
                     covers
                        and
                              tried
                                 to
                                       spoon

Funny Ross,

Hey I saw that Lenhart has made his way to our email bullshit, thanks for
giving us a call this weekend when you were in town. By the way can we all
stay at your house when we are in Denver!
I promise to have Robicheaux tested before your Maw gets hit by the banjo!

Subject:	Re: Blanchard


As we all know, Blanchard was a GDI his first semester at LSU.  While living in Power dorm, Blanchard once overheard one of the Pi PHi for boys that he was hanging out with say ""Hey, Dude, Sorority girls are hot!""  Blanchard, being from Paincourteville and not being what we would call a 'master' of the English language, though that this 'fresh' Pi Phi meant ""All greek girls are good in bed.""  So what did Blanchard do.  He went out and found the first GREEK girl he could, and he started dating her.  After many pleasant years, (some of which I will not mention for Tim's sake, and mine)  Tim and his Greek Goddess are engaged.  Yes, that's right.  Tim took Lenhart's advice (because we all know that Lenhart is the authority on relationships with the opposite sex; I mean, who wouldn't take his advice) and Tim decided to start his life sentence with a lovely girl who has bunch of friends who all give it up like it was going out o! f style.  
 
Tim's wedding is on THE DAY OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE GAME.  For those of you who are not Tiger fans (which seems to be most of you these days), that is Oct. 20th.  I know, it is an away game, which is better than having a wedding on a home game.  But some of us who are fans like to go to the out of town games.  True story, here.  I went to a wedding with Louise and her mother on Friday night.  You have not lived until you take two dates to a wedding, one of whom is engaged to your good friend and the other whom cannot speak the language.  Anyway, after the wedding that we attended, Louise's mom asked me if I would prefer Tim's wedding ceremony be in either half English and half Greek, or all in Greek.  I responded ""I do not care.  I will be listening to the LSU game on my headphones anyway.""  I know what some of you are saying, it is only one game.  Yes, and I am sure that was the only weekend they could hav! e it since so many of us from New Orleans have been to a wedding at the Greek Cultural Center, because all of us from New Orleans have been to numerous weddings / goat roasts there.  Anyway, it is a done deal, and we are all happy for the couple.
 
The real point of this e-mail is to organize Tim's bachelor party.  We have it planned for the weekend of September 22 (what a novel idea!!!  Plan a wedding event on a weekend where there is neither an LSU event, nor Jazz Fest!!!)  We are planning to go to Vegas.  As per our current plans, we would leave on that Thursday (the 20th, I think) and return on Sunday.  'Paw Paw' Blanchard heard that in September, his game of choice really starts hitting, that of course would be the nickel slots.  'Paw Paw' already has his Panama Jack hat, his         ""Geaux Dinar-deaux"" T-shirt, his jams, and his black socks with brown leather sandals packed and ready.  His fanny pack is stuffed with Twinkies and silver dimes.  He is really fired up about the $1.99 shrimp cocktail (early bird special, of course.)
The plans are to get there Thursday night (Nicky, get more drink tickets.)  Thursday night we can get settled, possibly gamble a bit.  On Friday, maybe play golf (although I will probably be too drunk / hung over / missing for an early tee time.)  On Friday night, we can go ""clubbin'"", as I am sure The Tricky Texas Trio (Lenhart, Landry, and Mitch) will want to do.  On Saturday, Tim wants to wake up early, get the sports section of the Advocate, drink coffee, and bitch about the Tigers.  Instead, we are going to watch and bet on College Football all day.
Saturday night, Tim wants to go see Sigfried and Roy.  However, we are not doing that.  If he wants to see gay men play with caged tigers, he can find out the next time Nesbitt tries out for the LSU cheerleading team.  Instead, either SaturDay or Friday night, myself and a select group (yet to be determined, but including Lenhart if he is not doing his best Ricky Martin impression at Club C2K) will go on a recon mission to the Deja Vu.  Therefore, on Saturday night, we will have entertainment in the room that some of us have seen before, and who know what is expected of them (that way Lenhart will not make the entertainment  cry when he asks them to fuck his Elway blow-up doll).  Remember Tim.  If you use a strap on, it is not considered cheating.  I am a future lawyer.  I should know.
This weekend is September 22.  There is no excuse for you to come up with when you have this much notice.  Out of money?  Bullshit.  Save up until then.  Have to work?  Bullshit.  Take a vacation day.  Actually, September will be the first month that I will be gainfully employed.  But, I know that my boss, the Honorable G.Thomas Porteous, will let me off for one day if debauchery will be had, although I may have to put a few hundreds on black for him periodically throughout the weekend.
For those of you who will be recently married, I already have an excuse for you.  ""Honey, Tim came to all OUR wedding functions.  The least I can do is return the favor.""
For those of you that will be married shortly after Tim, I also have an excuse. ""Baby / Schmoopy / I wish your tits were as big as Mindy/, if want other people to come to our wedding functions, then I have to attend theirs.""  For all of you single guys, no excuse.
Please respond to this e-mail at your earliest convenience, or I will see ya'll this weekend.  All plans are subject to change.  (Chad, if you want to send an e-mail to only me, hit 'Reply to sender.'  If you hit 'Reply to all'. it sends the message to all of the RECEPIENTS of the original message.  I know that you said Law School was such a stupid idea compared to Business School, but I think you could learn from some of our lessons, such as it is better to remain silent and be thought of as a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.)
 
Hope this e-mail finds you doing well.
 
Signed,
Granola, Blarry, your Daddy, Mushroom head, Captain Nic, King, Smokey, charming drunk, your heighness, the one who never looses his emotions when he drinks, SG Nerd, Governor, lawyer, or anything else you want to call me.

Subject:	Apologies

I want to apologize to everyone for my Houdini act on Friday.  I went home to get a new battery for my cell phone (the phone died, I didn't turn it off), change clothes, etc. and ended up falling asleep on my couch.  It's lame but that is what happened.  I understand you had trouble finding the house (from cell messages).  Again, I am sorry for not getting back in touch.  

Thanks
Harry B.

I manage a restricted gas product on EOL.  The product is PG&E Topock # 51408.  I need to add Occidental Energy Trading and TXU Energy Marketing to the list of counterparties that have access to this product.  If you could notify me when they have been added I would appreciate it.

Matt,
To refresh your memory from Friday night, I got laid off and am doing independent work right now.  Although the money is good, the stability is a factor. So, if there is anyone you might know at Enron to help me get an interview for that associate program, I would appreciate it.  My resume is attached.  Thanks for helping me out.  Take care.

P.S.  LSU preseason ranked #8 in CBS Sportsline power poll.  Not sure how I feel about that.

Matt-

 Hey there!  Have you recovered from the Big Bash yet??  Heard you put on a
kickass party...I heard ALL the details..:)  Anyway,  as it is now close to
January, Max wants me to send an email to you to pass on to all the ushers
(Peder, Ryan, Scott &  Merlin) since you have their email addresses.
Florida in January is pretty busy, so you definately want to book your
hotel reservations NOW...you don't need a deposit yet, I don't think, you
just need to hold a room.  Here is the info. on the hotel where everyone is
staying (where we got group rates), also this is where the Rehearsal Dinner
& the Sunday brunch are...the wedding is down the street, so you guys may
just want one rental car for all of you.  I think Thursday afternoon  is
when you will all go to the Tux place in North Miami to try on your tuxes &
make sure that the measurments are right when they still have enough time
to make any adjustments.  Friday, during the day, Max will have something
planned for you guys...

Please start getting your measurements now & we will send you another email
when we find the place for you to call in your measurements in Miami.  Call
with any questions (303) 832-8160....The hotties in Miami are waiting for
you...

The Miami Beach Ocean Resort
3025 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach
1-800-550-0505

*Say you are with the Harris/Schrutt wedding for group rates of:
$160/night - city view      $200/night - ocean view


If you need a travel agent, we have used June Schram with Young Travel
previously at 1-800-426-9968 & again,  say you are with our wedding
party...

Take care & be safe.....Jen

I manage a restricted gas product on EOL.  The product is PG&E Topock # 51408.  I need to add Occidental Energy Trading and TXU Energy Marketing to the list of counterparties that have access to this product.  If you could notify me when they have been added I would appreciate it. 

Thank you,

Racist photos of fraternity members
rocks Auburn, brings condemnation
<<...>>
By DREW JUBERA < mailto:djubera@ajc.com <mailto:djubera@ajc.com> >
Atlanta Journal-Constitution Staff Writer
<<...>>
Auburn, Ala. -- When the Southern Poverty Law Center received a call this
week about Internet photos of an Auburn University fraternity member
dressed
as a rifle-toting Klansman pretending to lynch a white student in
blackface,
the staff checked out the photo's date.

""We wanted to verify that it was taken in 2001, not 1951,"" said Kelvin
Datcher of the center in Montgomery that tracks incidents of bigotry. ""The
kids who called us were frantic.""

The photo, and others of students in blackface wearing Afros, jewelry and
jerseys with the lettering of a black fraternity, were taken this year at
Halloween parties at two fraternity houses and posted on the Internet by a
party-photo service.

The incident has rocked the campus of more than 22,000 students, which
bills
itself as ""the loveliest village on the plain"" and says it is intent on
recruiting minorities. As the photos illustrate, a racist, segregated past
is hard to escape.

Students at Auburn and other colleges have no personal memory of Jim Crow
segregation. But when it comes to socializing, many students gravitate
toward those of their own race. And social fraternities and sororities --
many of which used to enforce racial exclusionary clauses -- remain some of
the last bastions of segregationist attitudes.

Last year, when a black freshman applied to the University of Georgia's
all-white Alpha Gamma Delta, most of the members were adamant that she be
rejected. ""If we had a black girl in our sorority, none of the fraternities
would want to do anything with us,"" one was quoted as saying.

That incident came to light because one sorority member, Ali Davis, filed a
racial discrimination complaint. UGA temporarily suspended Alpha Gamma
Delta
during an investigation. Davis, saying she felt ostracized, later left the
school.

Around the country, the Kappa Alpha Order, which is fond of displaying the
Confederate battle flag, has been implicated in various racial incidents in
recent years, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported.

The Louisiana Tech University chapter was placed on probation after a
confrontation with black football players in which frat members made racist
remarks, the center said. At Millsaps College in Mississippi, Kappa Alphas
dressed in Afro wigs and blackface to protest pro-minority initiatives. In
February, the KA chapter at the University of North Texas received a
five-year suspension for disorderly conduct and verbal intimidation after
some members were accused of racist remarks.

Such antics aren't limited to Kappa Alpha or the South, the Southern
Poverty
Law Center said. Several fraternities and sororities at New Hampshire's
Dartmouth College threw a ""ghetto party"" in which students dressed up as
urban African-Americans -- a theme that has surfaced at other campuses --
while a sorority there promoted a ""slave auction"" fund-raiser. The Sigma
Chi
fraternity at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln burned a cross at one of
its ceremonies.

Such incidents leave college administrators, especially those assigned to
foster diversity, wringing their hands.
""We've been working so hard to do the right thing, and then something like
this happens,"" Doyle Bickers, Auburn's director of admissions, said
Wednesday of the warped Halloween humor. ""It breaks your heart.""

""You can't escape your history,"" added Jim Hardin, an adviser in the
student
life center. ""When something like this comes up, the question is, 'Have you
really changed, or are you just putting on a good front?' ""

What has changed at Auburn, according to many black students, who make up
7.2 percent of the student body, is the administration's swift and open
reaction.

Interim President William F. Walker immediately condemned the costumes as
""shocking and outrageous"" and suspended the fraternities, Beta Theta Pi and
Delta Sigma Phi. He attended a meeting of the Black Student Union and
promised a thorough but swift investigation, which is expected to be
completed within 10 days. Stories on the incident were displayed on the
university's Web site.

Delta Sigma Phi has expelled the two members who dressed as a Klansman and
his lynching victim, and suspended four others.

""Similar things have happened before,"" said Roland Harris, a junior
management information systems major and member of Phi Beta Sigma, one of
four historically black fraternities on campus. ""But this time a lot of
people saw it, and they have to do something.""

Auburn admitted its first black student, surrounded by 100 Alabama state
troopers, in 1961. The first black man pledged a traditionally white
fraternity in 1984, and there currently is one black pledge among those 24
fraternities.

Auburn's overall black population is still less than at most Southeastern
Conference universities, but stepped-up recruiting efforts led to a 24
percent increase of African-Americans admitted to this year's freshman
class. One sign of changing times: The university's Student Government
Association president is an African-American.

""We were finally beginning to say, 'Thank God, we're making some headway,'
and here comes this sad, unfortunate, damaging incident,"" said John
Bello-Ogunu, head of the university's office of multicultural affairs. ""It
will no doubt be detrimental to our efforts to attract not only minority
students, but faculty and other staff as well.""

Bello-Ogunu said the administration's reaction has been ""on the mark."" He
added that more action is needed, including diversity training for
fraternities. At the invitation of university officials and students, the
Southern Poverty Law Center will conduct a ""mass workshop"" on tolerance on
Wednesday.

Prentice Gilbert, an Auburn senior who oversees the campus' historically
black fraternities and who has helped recruit black students, said it will
take time to remedy the Halloween incident's impact.

""I have to keep reminding myself these were the actions of a few
individuals
who do not represent Auburn as a whole,"" Gilbert said. ""This is the most
devastating blow we could take.""

""The bottom line is, do we really want to be the 'Auburn family'?"" he
added.
""If so, we really could become the loveliest village on the plain, as our
motto says.""

   nobody speaks english, dirty, high crime rate.  We'll probably be at a
   resort though so it won't matter.  If you like the big discoteque dance
   clubs then it's your place, which I'll bet you do.  I'd rather lay back
   in
   the caymans, and I've never been there.  I'm getting old I think.

   does miami suck?  i haven't ever been there.  i have been to caymans and
   they are awesome.  it is really laid back and very expensive.  either
   place
   will be fun, i just think miami  will be a better night life.

      she called me.  she keeps in touch with me.  she spilled the beans on
      the
      plans to move the wedding.  i think if we went to cayman we would
   spend
      over a grand each.    miami will rock.

They have gay people at LaStada??? 
J/K - I'm not sure why they are going there.  They said that there is a big 
party tonight.  But I think some people are going to Sierra also. 
I was hoping you'd be in your chipendale costume.  :)

Yo Lenny,
Glad you finally pulled your big head out of Chemosabe's ass and decided to
chat with us.  Thanks for looking us up when you came to New Orleans, I
guess since none of us drink Jamison and wack off to the Sundance film
festival we're not cool...

Anyways, thanks for letting us stay at your maw's place when we go skiing.
Yes I'm going bald but your maw said that if you look good with hair then
you'll look good without it- so this year I'll shave my sack as an added
bonus...  Don't worry about saving for me a place to sleep, I'll just make a
matress out of dog hair from those slobbering, gaseous, farting bulldogs
your maw has.

Wish you were coming on the ski trip, but I realize the gay olympic trials
are in South Beach at the same time, so I understand.  Hope you qualify.

cjrob

Donnie -

Sounds good and you missed one hell of a weekend.  From what I hear,
everyone had an awesome time.  Celeste and I counted 12 weddings we got
invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer,
Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly.  I'll let
everyone know about the invite, but it may be easier for you to let me know
next time you come in town.

Send me your phone numbers again when you get a chance -

Florval,
How's married life?  I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste.  Again,
sorry
we were not able to make it down for the wedding.  I think it is safe to
assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we went
to that Saturday.  I hope there are some good stories.  I am guessing you
are back from the honeymoon at this point, and you guys had a great time.
Hopefully, you will hold off on populating the earth with any more
Florval's.  At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations.
I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future.  I may try to
get down there sometime late summer or fall.  Also, there is always an open
invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC (actually Northern VA - And to
think in my 1st 18 years, all I thought existed was the Westbank.  There is
so much more!  Thought you might get a kick out of that comment).  This
invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit our
nation's capitol (It's such a better place now that the 'White Trash' that
was living in the 'White House' has moved out).  I know it not as cool as
Melancon living 5 blocks from Wrigley, but you know?  The invite holds good
not only for Mr.& Mrs Louis Florval Generes (what the hell is that?), but
also any of the other bums down in Houston that I have not seen if a few
years.  Later Val.

Please forward to Suzanne as well.  Will you review this spreadsheet for April penalties associated with Texaco?  The volumes and prices did not look correct to me.  Let me know and I will have Anne change the value.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike:  Attached is a spreadsheet that summarizes the possible penalties we will be charging on the six PG&E Topock April Baseload load purchases that were severely cut throughout the month.  If we use the Gas Daily High Price plus $0.15, then the total penalties will be $2,032,902, but if we use the methodology described in the contract (Gas Daily), the total penalties will be $889,377.

I spoke to Phillip while you were out to see which method we should use. He said to wait until you returned.  I also verified with Darron that from a settlements perspective, we can send penalty invoices at any time.  Let's discuss when you return.  I have copies of all of the pertinent information.

Thanks

Anne

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

Stephanie-

I manage a restricted gas product on EOL.  The product is PG&E Topock # 51408.  I need to add Occidental Energy Trading and TXU Energy Marketing to the list of counterparties that have access to this product.  If you could notify me when they have been added I would appreciate it. 

Thank you,

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

"Re: The 9th Friday State of the Union","it is so good to finally get one of these state of the unions again.  i don't know if i can speak for everyone, but i sure have missed it.    it is just good to read all the smart, witty humor again.  i especially thought the part about screaming ""who let the dogs out"" was quite funny.  it makes it especially funny b/c the employees play along instead of yelling out ""shut up nerd"".   as most of you know chad and i no longer live together.  it was real tough to see him go b/c we are pretty close, but not as close as maziarz and i evidently are.  but every now and then i still get reminders that i used to live with chad  like the other day when i was vacuming.  i decided to vacum behind the couch b/c i had never cleand back there.  when i looked behind the couch the floor was littered with about 50 toenails.    at first i was pretty freaked out and i was thinking how could these toenails possibly get here?  but then i remembered i use to live with chad and he had a nasty habit of pulling off his toenails.  i should have figured that he didn't dispose of them properly.  it is good to see that chad has figured out how to use the email system again.  last week enron sent out a company wide email and our boy chad replied back to the whole company.  i felt pretty embarrassed for him after he sent the first reply, but went he replied to the whole company a second time i just thought that he was an idiot.  now he will be known as the guy who replied not once but twice to a company wide email.  well, i sure am looking foward to the next state of the union.  i know i will since i am going to vegas to spend all my money at the strip clubs.

Elizabeth,

Matt has given me verbal approval to have you change the pricing on the following
transactions.   

	1. SITARA #576162 should be $10.50.   Currently it is $12.35.
	2. SITARA #573532 should be Tiered Rate-Step:   5,000mmbtu/day @ $8.90
							10,000mmbtu/day @ $8.85

Please see the original e-mails below.
I would like to get this booked in May 2001 accounting, so let me know as soon as I can re-draft.
Thanks,
Doug  x3-0560

Subject:	Jan-01 Sales Price Discrp

Matt,

Attached are the audio tapes from PG&E regarding two Jan 2001 sales price discrepancies.
The $12.35 vs $10.50 issue relates to SITARA #576162 (first audio file below).
Allen King has said there is no way he would have paid $12.35 at MALIN on that day.
Please see rows 182 & 183 on my attached spreadsheet....is it possible that 
SITARA #576162 was copied from SITARA#575575, but the price is different? 

The second audio file below relates to SITARA #573532 where Allen says the 5,000 is at $8.85.
We show the whole day (1/19/01) at $8.90.....see rows 158 & 159 of my attached spreadsheet.

Please advise....let me know if you have trouble playing the audios.
Thanks,
Doug x3-0560            << File: PG&E Jan 2001 UNIFY - Sales.xls >>

Matt-

 Hey there!  Have you recovered from the Big Bash yet??  Heard you put on a
kickass party...I heard ALL the details..:)  Anyway,  as it is now close to
January, Max wants me to send an email to you to pass on to all the ushers
(Peder, Ryan, Scott &  Merlin) since you have their email addresses.
Florida in January is pretty busy, so you definately want to book your
hotel reservations NOW...you don't need a deposit yet, I don't think, you
just need to hold a room.  Here is the info. on the hotel where everyone is
staying (where we got group rates), also this is where the Rehearsal Dinner
& the Sunday brunch are...the wedding is down the street, so you guys may
just want one rental car for all of you.  I think Thursday afternoon  is
when you will all go to the Tux place in North Miami to try on your tuxes &
make sure that the measurments are right when they still have enough time
to make any adjustments.  Friday, during the day, Max will have something
planned for you guys...

Please start getting your measurements now & we will send you another email
when we find the place for you to call in your measurements in Miami.  Call
with any questions (303) 832-8160....The hotties in Miami are waiting for
you...

The Miami Beach Ocean Resort
3025 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach
1-800-550-0505

*Say you are with the Harris/Schrutt wedding for group rates of:
$160/night - city view      $200/night - ocean view


If you need a travel agent, we have used June Schram with Young Travel
previously at 1-800-426-9968 & again,  say you are with our wedding
party...

Take care & be safe.....Jen

                  yes, you have to type in her name where it says search

      then
            her
               site
                  will come up.  it is definitely her b/c that picture you

            is

A blind guy on a bar stool shouts to the bartender, ""Hey! Wanna hear a
blonde joke?"" The bar immediately becomes absolutely quiet. In a hushed voice,
the guy next to him says, ""Before you tell that joke, you should know
something.""
""The bartender is blond, the bouncer is blond, and I'm a 6' tall, 200 pound
blond with a black belt in karate.  What's more, the guy sitting next to me
is 6'2,"" weighs 225 pounds, and he's a blond weight lifter."" He continues,
""The fella to your right is blond, 6'5"" and pushing 300 pounds, and he's a
wrestler. Think about it seriously, Mister. You still wanna tell that
joke?""  The blind guy says, ""Nah! Not if I'm gonna have to explain it five
times.
