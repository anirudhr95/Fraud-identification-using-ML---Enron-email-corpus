+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Latest NFL Player News

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/25/01
Grbac will likely be a game-time decision for Sunday's game, according to
<i>The Baltimore Sun</i>. He threw very little in practice and is still
suffering from a sore chest. Randall Cunningham will start if Grbac is
unable to play. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Moss is suffering from tendonitis in his left Achilles tendon, according to
<i>The Pioneer Press</i>. Moss missed practice Wednesday but is expected to
play on Sunday. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/25/01
Martin might be ready to play when the Falcons resume their season on
November 4. He has been sidelined for the past four games because of a
broken collarbone but the <i>Atlanta Journal-constitution</i> reports that
he ran routes on Wednesday and caught some passes. 

Wane McGarity, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
The Saints have signed McGarity, who was released by the Cowboys earlier
this season. McGarity has minimal value now, but he might eventually work
his way into the Saints' regular rotation of receivers. 

Matt Stover, K BAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he
will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The
injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve
Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. 

Eric Metcalf, WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
The Washington Redskins signed Metcalf on Wednesday. He will be used mostly
as a returner and has minimal Fantasy value. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/25/01
Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and
other structural damage to his right foot. ""He's not going to be really
ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,""
coach George Seifert said Wednesday. ""Basically, it just separated,""
Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. ""The ligaments, tendons
and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together."" Richard Huntley,
who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate
at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he
expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01
Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The <i>Detroit
Free Press</i> reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a
bad bruise and not a sprain. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/25/01
Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at
Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams'
defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of
dizziness. It was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked
Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second
half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as
""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the
injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was
given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie
Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup. 

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and
could be lost for the season. ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to
play this Sunday,"" Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year
and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has
been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained
on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game
against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the
weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be
limited if he does play Sunday. 

Clint Stoerner, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of
fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo
said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to
play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move.
Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL.
He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards
and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and
coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday. Wright expected to
have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a
final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game
until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf
if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance
that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been
with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet. 

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01
Davis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg
is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week.
X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the <i>Denver Post</i>, but Davis'
leg is throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If
Davis is able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited.

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/24/01
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe
Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer
caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a
reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last
season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach
Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and
said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet
passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced
by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League
and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40
straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after
receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.

Bert Emanuel, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are
looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending
injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job.
Don't bother picking him up.

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for
Monday's game against Tennessee.

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/24/01
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn
patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
The New York <i>Daily News</i> says there is still a noticeable hitch in
Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect
him to return is Dec. 2.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on
the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting
lineup. But the <i>Kansas City Star</i> notes Chris Thomas is still working
with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player
will start on Thursday against the Colts.

Larry Foster, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 10/24/01
According to the <I>Detroit Free Press</I>, Foster is expected to start in
Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an
inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right
now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments
in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play
in a keeper league.

Neil Rackers, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
According to the <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i>, the Bengals worked out three
kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is
a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/24/01
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He
will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress
in his recovery and might play this week.

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to
the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's
absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a
chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer.
Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside
Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for
Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on
Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will
be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib
Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the
Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He
is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice
tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it
will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach
Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game
against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any
problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>Tacoma News Tribune</I>, Seahawks Head Coach Mike
Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as
he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I
didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he
got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would
suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster
room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure
you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost
the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy
rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game
against Miami, according to the <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</I>. He
replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with
a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a
Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at
Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the
concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss
Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point
in the season.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected
to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of
Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend
you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is
hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this
week.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a
sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken
ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback
game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided
whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the
Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't
recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain
he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring
strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the
week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish
it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled
late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11
carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to
post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster
allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this
week. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury.
However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's
game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in
this week's game. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's
game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
<i>The Tennessean</i> reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back.
The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment
options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to
play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder
showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status
for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to
week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom
Coughlin told <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. ""It remains to be seen when
Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well
this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return
date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his
groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to
play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told <i>The Baltimore
Sun</i> he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game.
Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained
ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at
running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against
Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm
feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be
something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown
a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will
replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York
Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game
against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</I>, Canidate is expected to
start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I
wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said.
""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to
let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved
himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be
starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close
to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was
a blessing for me because I was able to get treatment every day,"" Stokes
told the <I>Contra Costa Times</I>. ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say
I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre,
however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to
be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants'
starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on
Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his
surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a
sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game
against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week
ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this
game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to
let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is
he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling
in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so
starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable. 

Dez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>, White will start in place of the
injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching
abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper
leagues. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/23/01
Terrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus
Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. <I>The Chicago Sun-Times</I> is now
reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell
being used as the team's third receiver. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The
team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game
against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular
season game this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring
injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see
him by now, McGinnis told the <I>Arizona Republic</I>. ""That's why we both
handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning
to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he
can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still
on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday
night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron
Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge
of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week
Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the
standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden
opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks
to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.
The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep
him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress
during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seven.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice
this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye
on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,""
Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>. ""Warrick
pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who
it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured,
so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week
Seven.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at
Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he
should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK,"" Favre told the <I>Milwaukee
Journal-Sentinel</I>. ""Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that
will help.""

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a
sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren
finished the game in his absence.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Despite a great performance by Thomas Sunday against Cincinnati, the
<I>Chicago Tribune</I> reports that the Bears will continue to use an
alternating system with him and James Allen. ""We will continue to use them
both,"" said offensive coordinator John Shoop. ""Anthony did a great job
today, though."" As long as this duo continues to split carries, it's hard
to recommend either as a weekly starter in a Fantasy league. We believe
Thomas is the better long-term pick, though.

Brad Hoover, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Hoover left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury is not
believed to be serious. Monitor Hoover's situation. He might get some
carries now that starter Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the season. 

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Baxter returned from muscle spasms Sunday against Cincinnati, and had a
one-yard TD reception in the game. Despite the solid performance, he's
still not a reliable weekly starter in a Fantasy league.

Robert Wilson, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Wilson suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game and was held to a 24-yard
reception. He is also recovering from a broken thumb. Wilson will be
evaluated on a daily basis. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 10/22/01
Cleeland suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered
to be serious. He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception.
Cleeland will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/22/01
Terrell will start at wide receiver in place of injured Marcus Robinson in
Sunday's game against San Francisco. If you're a Robinson owner, consider
adding Terrell to your squad. The rookie had seven receptions for 91 yards
on Sunday.

Neil Rackers, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
According to published reports, the Bengals are becoming frustrated with
Rackers' erratic play. The team might look into signing another kicker.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Jones sprained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Scott suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss
next week's game against Detroit.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/22/01
Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry
for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/22/01
Grbac is day to day with a rib contusion. His status for next week's game
is uncertain. Randall Cunningham would start if Grbac can't play.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/22/01
Allen is day to day with a sprained left ankle. According to the
<i>Baltimore Sun</i>, the Ravens have been shopping for RB help, indicating
Allen's status as a starter is anything but firm.

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Christian suffered a sprained neck in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated
on a daily basis. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Jefferson aggravated back, left ankle and big toe injuries Sunday and also
burst the bursa sac in his right elbow. He might not be at full strength,
but Jefferson is expected to play when the Falcons return from their bye on
November 4. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in the
Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again
until November 4. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/22/01
Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't
necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball
successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for
Bruce to do better next week against the Saints. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/22/01
Detroit Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg said Monday that Crowell tore the
patella tendon in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season.
Crowell suffered the injury while leaping for a pass in the end zone in the
second half of Sunday's game. The Lions will use a combination of Larry
Foster, Scotty Anderson and Desmond Howard in his absence.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Robinson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral
ligament in his left knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and
will miss the rest of the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field
with six minutes left in the first half after the injury. Marty Booker will
be the primary receiver in his absence.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in
goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards.
He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has
clearly emerged as a featured back.

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/22/01
Williams, who was averaging 4.5 yards a carry, gained just 51 yards on 21
carries Sunday, a 2.4-yard average. He had eight carries for 5 yards in the
second half. ""We couldn't do anything in the second half,"" Williams said.
""We didn't block right a few times, other times they filled holes and made
plays."" Look for Williams to rebound and have a solid game against the Rams
this Sunday. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Chandler had another solid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and
39 yards. He also completed 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to
be an adequate starter for the rest of the season. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/22/01
Biakabutuka broke his foot in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game after
rushing for 121 yards and a touchdown. He is to have surgery Monday and is
out for the season. 

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective
at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to
prove himself as a Fantasy player.

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was
good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games
this year and has become a major scoring threat even though he is not very
effective outside of the red zone.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a
touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however,
but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona.
Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a
starting nod every week.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Luccis Losers Player News

Steve McNair, Injured QB Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's
game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, Active WR Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York
Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game
against New Orleans. 

Duce Staley, Reserve RB Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish
it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled
late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11
carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to
post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster
allows for a solid replacement. 

Ike Hilliard, Active WR Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants'
starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on
Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his
surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Cameron Cleeland, Reserve TE Updated 10/22/01
Cleeland suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered
to be serious. He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception.
Cleeland will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Mike Alstott, Reserve RB Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect much from Alstott this week. Warrick Dunn is healthy enough to
start again, and will be the featured back against Pittsburgh.

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 10/19/01
Expect good numbers from Carter this week. He is a big-game player who will
not be flustered by the improved Green Bay defense.

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 10/19/01
Booker would make an excellent Fantasy starter in his game Sunday against
the Bengals. Cincinnati is without cornerback Rodney Heath, which will make
it difficult to defend Booker this week.

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 10/18/01
If Muhsin Muhammad is still being hindered by his rib injury, Hayes could
be in line for a big game against Washington. In any event, Hayes is worth
starting in deeper leagues based on the matchup. 

Kurt Warner, Active QB Updated 10/18/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a
a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York
Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Charlie Garner, Active RB Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> points out Garner has apparently supplanted
Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent
before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee
injury.

James McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 10/12/01
McKnight will definitely be a TD threat this week. He should be able to get
loose for some long gains.

Ravens, Active DT Updated 10/07/01
Linebacker Ray Lewis (elbow) was in the starting lineup for Baltimore in
Sunday's game against Tennessee. Baltimore's defense looks spectacular
early on, and could put up some big Fantasy points against the Titans. 

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Hi Paul,
 
Ran into ""Tim"" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our ""get together"" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
 
Take care,

I just wanted to check to see if you have had a chance to review the

and I need to send the invoices out before I leave.

Also,  I am still working on the CIG issue for prior months.  I have two
more months of invoices to review and am waiting to hear back from our
Denver office on the volume reconciliation.  Have you received any wire
detail from your payable department?  It would really help in finding
the cash that belongs to the CIG invoices.  Since all points were paid

invoices were paid in full.  I appreciate your help and patience in this

Latest NFL Player News

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against
the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch
a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis'
output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him
every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent
Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats
and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been
very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is
still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a
weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use
him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use
their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander,
and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield
in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your
active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.
Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the
run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has
been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the
wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you
should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has
only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect
another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season.
He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we
recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you
use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you
consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the
season.

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep
leagues.

Travis Minor, RB MIA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the
defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills
have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While
he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every
week.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the
end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but
you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running
back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'
secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He
might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and
there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas
City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep
league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your
lineup.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday,
which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We
recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against
the Jets in Week Nine.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should
rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against
this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less
mistake-prone quarterback.

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Alexander will be back in the
starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent
prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a
gamble. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't
recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this
is the game he will break his slump.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some
trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia
secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore,
and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at
quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat
Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for
explosive stats.

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to
keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less
impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes
than most receivers in the league.

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing
the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this
week if you have no other options at running back.

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance
Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight
end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However,
you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday
against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way
and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend
you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent.
However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer
downfield for great stats this week.

Dominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should
definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats,
but should give good rushing totals and a score.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in
recent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game
Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend
these two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be
Clark.

Dwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Carswell might factor into the Broncos' passing game more Thursday against
Dallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver. However, he had no catches in
similar circumstances in Week 10, and the Cowboys will be ready to defend
short passes to him. Only use Carswell if you're thin at the tight end
position.

Keith Poole, WR DEN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
If Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday's game against Dallas, Poole will need
to step up as the Broncos' top receiving target. However, we don't
recommend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a
reliable point-producer. Keep Poole reserved against Dallas.

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Don't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. he has been inconsistent
this season, and may not do much against a physical Pittsburgh defense.

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Mason should post respectable statistics against the Steelers. Don't expect
him to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense.

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Alstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't
expect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,
scoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. 

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Johnson threw for 399 yards last week against Chicago, but he also threw no
touchdowns and was picked off twice. He's been unreliable from a Fantasy
standpoint, and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Johnson had a big game against Chicago last weekend, catching 12 passes for
89 yards. He was held out of the end zone again, but look for that to
change on Monday night against St. Louis. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New
England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,
so avoid starting him if at all possible. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Holt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend against
New England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and is
worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Bruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven
catches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against
a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. 

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gary will likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas, but
we don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats. The Cowboys will
probably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky
starts this week since they have been splitting time.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
With favorite target Rod Smith likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have
questionable receivers to work with Thursday against Dallas. However, the
Cowboys' defense will probably focus on the run and force Griese to beat
them through the air. He should provide your team with decent stats and is
worth using this week.

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Faulk had 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against New England last
weekend. He's the best player in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in
any league format. 

Jamel White, RB CLE - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
The Browns may use White as a change-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar
Bengals run defense. You might want to consider him as a third running back
option on your team if you're lacking in starting options.

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, and is now listed as questionable for
Monday's game against Tampa Bay due to a shoulder injury. With the lack of
depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is
something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do if he's
healthy. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401
yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and
will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent
secondary. 

O.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Santiago catches the occasional pass for the Browns and could find the end
zone every now or then. He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati
secondary, so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores. Only use
Santiago if you're desperate for a tight end, however, as he rarely gets a
big yardage total.

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Johnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game
this season, and is now a very reliable No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver.
Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the
Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get him into your lineup.

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Couch has a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards,
four TDs), whom he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks
you could choose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week,
give him a look.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Warrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't
provided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league.
His matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him
reserved this week.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Although Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games
against the Browns, whom he plays Sunday, we can't recommend you use him
this week. He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from
a Fantasy perspective.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
We can't advise you use Kitna as he goes up against the Browns' secondary
this week. Cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year,
leading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the
Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678
rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in
your active lineup week in and week out in any league.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Centers has been a great pass-catching back for the Bills this season, but
he will face a Miami defense on Sunday that will likely be able to contain
him. Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks,
logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a bigger
challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reserving him.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
There's a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week
against a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent
limited role in the Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he
has a good history against the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and
he might be worth using as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.

Eric Johnson, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina.
Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth
starting at this point. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Stokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for 72 yards
and two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable overall,
however, so starting him is still a risky move. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Henry had a very disappointing game against the Seahawks in Week 10, and
will likely struggle again against the far-better Dolphins defense on
Sunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit using this week.

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a
strong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar
Seahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this
week despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the
bench for Week 11.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
After a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self.
We don't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so
don't use him this week.

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Sharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving
touchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced
Jacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe
into your active lineup every week.

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly
developing into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot
streak and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you
get Ismail into your starting lineup this week.

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Buckhalter will return from suspension this weekend, and will be available
for Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Staley has established himself
as the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhalter is a gamble. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Staley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in
Philadelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes
him worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Just when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two catches for 17 yards
like he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will still be in the
starting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gamble nonetheless. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Barber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a
touchdown in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run
this season, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their
offense in Week 11. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Toomer caught five balls for 60 yards against Minnesota on Monday night,
but he'll struggle to post similar numbers vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a
formidable secondary, so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a
wise move. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Collins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321
yards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into
the end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a
result, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Jackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does
have the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a
deeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Horn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing
through them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two
touchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against
New England based on his potential to post huge numbers. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Bennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the
NFL style of game. He's been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely
worth a roster spot at this point. He'll do nothing against Chicago's
aggressive run defense, so don't bother starting him. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Culpepper finally had a breakout game last week, connecting on four
touchdown passes against the N.Y. Giants. He should have success against
Chicago's secondary on Sunday, so be sure to include him when you choose
your Week 11 starting lineup. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
The Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament
in his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery
in the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him
awaiting his return.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Glenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the pre-practice
walkthrough on Wednesday, according to published reports. He is unlikely to
play Sunday against New Orleans and shouldn't be on anyone's Fantasy roster
at this point.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Chamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the N.Y.
Giants, but he's expected to play this weekend vs. Chicago. Chamberlain has
been unreliable of late, and getting open against Chicago's tough
linebacking group won't be an easy task. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157
yards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same
Lions, whose defense is questionable at best. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Favre had a somewhat rough outing last weekend, throwing three
interceptions against Atlanta. However, he's still one of the best Fantasy
quarterbacks in the league, and he should bounce back on Thanksgiving
against Detroit. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Freeman has been solid of late, catching four touchdown passes in his last
five games. He's a must start against Detroit's vulnerable pass defense in
Week 11. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Franks has cooled off considerably in recent weeks, but his potential to
find the end zone still makes him a good Fantasy player. Unless you have a
better option, starting Franks is advisable. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend
against Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in
the league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Batch had a huge game against Arizona last weekend, but he's been
inconsistent this season for the most part. He's better off used when the
matchup is right, so facing a tough Green Bay defense may not bode well for
his Fantasy numbers.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Morton had a big game against Arizona last weekend, and has been a
surprisingly reliable Fantasy player this season. He may struggle against
Green Bay's tough pass defense, but he's still worth taking a gamble on in
Week 11. 

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Howard is not expected to miss an extended period of time due to his
shoulder injury. He hasn't practitced this week, however, and is listed as
doubtful for Thursday's game against Green Bay. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Emanuel, who suffered a sprained left knee during last weekend's game
against Arizona, will miss at least four weeks of action. There was a
chance that he'd be out for the season, but now he's expected to return in
mid-to-late December. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Stewart (ankle) practiced on Tuesday and feels as though he's ready to
return to action. ""I feel pretty good,"" Stewart told the <I>Detroit Free
Press</I>. ""It felt better than I thought. I'm just going to see, let (the
medical staff and coach Marty Mornhinweg) decide whether I play or not.""
His carries may be down a bit in his first game back, but he's worth
starting in deeper leagues, barring any setbacks. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Hambrick will return to fullback/backup duties on Thursday against Denver.
With Emmitt Smith expected to play, Hambrick isn't worth starting on your
Fantasy team in Week 11. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Galloway is a shell of his former self, catching only 24 passes through his
first seven games this season. Dallas' pathetic quarterbacks have been the
real reason for Galloway's subpar numbers, making him a huge gamble from a
Fantasy perspective. Unless you're desperate, don't consider starting
Galloway in Week 11. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but starting him is still
a gamble from a Fantasy perspective. Dallas has the worst pass offense in
the league, so playing Ismail isn't advisable unless you're desperate. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Miller put up solid numbers last weekend against Tampa Bay, throwing for
228 yards and three touchdowns. Miller has been inconsistent this season,
but starting him in Week 11 against a shaky Minnesota secondary is
definitely worth considering.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Thomas' yardage numbers have slipped in the last two weeks, but he's still
worth starting in Week 11 vs. Minnesota. The Vikings are giving up 124.3
yards rushing per game, so look for the Bears to run Thomas early and
often. 

Dez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
White is dealing with a slight ankle injury, but he's expected to play
against Minnesota. The Vikings secondary has been vulnerable to the pass
this season, so starting White in a deeper league is worth considering. 

Isaac Byrd, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Byrd will likely start in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad in Week 11
against Atlanta. The Falcons pass defense is one of the worst units in the
league, so Byrd could actually put up some decent Fantasy numbers. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Walls put up only two catches for 30 yards last weekend, but he did find
the end zone for the fifth time this season. Unless you've got a better
option, starting Walls on a weekly basis is advisable. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Smith had a mediocre game last weekend vs. Green Bay, but he's likely to
bounce back against Carolina. The Panthers have the worst run defense in
the league, so Smith should have no problem putting up solid Fantasy
numbers in Week 11. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he
could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one
of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues
may be worth considering. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on
Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary hasn't been playing well
of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is
advisable.

Luccis Losers Player News

Alex Van Pelt, Reserve QB Updated 11/21/01
Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a
strong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar
Seahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this
week despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the
bench for Week 11.

Charlie Garner, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.
Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the
run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

Mike Alstott, Reserve RB Updated 11/21/01
Alstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't
expect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,
scoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01
Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New
England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,
so avoid starting him if at all possible. 

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Kurt Warner, Active QB Updated 11/21/01
Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401
yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and
will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent
secondary. 

James McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep
leagues.

Larry Parker, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'
secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He
might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Duce Staley, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Staley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in
Philadelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes
him worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. 

Ike Hilliard, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Cameron Cleeland, Reserve TE Updated 11/20/01
Cleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'll likely
be replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last week
against Indianapolis. 

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 11/20/01
Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He
may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this
weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the
league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11. 

Ravens, Active DT Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after
undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of
the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage
than usual. 

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his
third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player
you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

"RE: Bob Picks Indy","Ok.....here's the deal. 

EVERYONE lost this week which means we all split 1st, 2nd and 3rd place
money. ($740 divided by 13)

We have a couple of options. 

1.  Receive $56.92 now.  (Maybe Bob W. will throw in the extra 8 cents for
everyone so we can round our winnings up to $57.00).  Game over.
2.  Let everything ride.  No coming back to collect later though!  This also
means that the pot of dollars will be smaller by the number of players
electing to take their winnings now. 

Please let me know your intentions by noon tomorrow:  Roll the dice and
continue to play or collect your money now.  

Thanks,

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

"Tri State - finish up","Paul,

Attached are drafts of the Tri State confirms for your review - I stuck around tonight till
Ryan amended the TAGG system so I was able to generate them...most of the way.  Review for economics:

  
(FYI, these drafts do NOT include the Annex A's, General Terms and Conditions, nor have I
signed them yet)

and then please call Bianca Ornelas (713.345.3782) and provide her with the 
counterparty contact name and fax number to add to the confirm.  She will execute for ENA
and fax out the docs to Tri-State.

(B - any questions, please call Paul at 303 575 6474.  Note: the Fixed Price on YB5833.1,.2
is the sum of the Prices of both legs...in case it looks funny to you, which is did to me.  I don't
know why they book it that way...whatever.I had Ryan put a comment in TAGG to that effect)  

Thanks everyone, and sorry I couldn't finish this up for you tonight, Paul.
-Diane

Latest NFL Player News

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against
the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch
a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis'
output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him
every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent
Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats
and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been
very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is
still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a
weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use
him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use
their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander,
and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield
in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your
active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.
Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the
run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has
been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the
wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you
should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has
only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect
another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season.
He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we
recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you
use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you
consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the
season.

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep
leagues.

Travis Minor, RB MIA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the
defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills
have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While
he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every
week.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the
end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but
you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running
back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'
secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He
might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and
there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas
City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep
league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your
lineup.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday,
which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We
recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against
the Jets in Week Nine.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should
rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against
this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less
mistake-prone quarterback.

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Alexander will be back in the
starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent
prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a
gamble. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't
recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this
is the game he will break his slump.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some
trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia
secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore,
and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at
quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat
Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for
explosive stats.

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to
keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less
impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes
than most receivers in the league.

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing
the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this
week if you have no other options at running back.

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance
Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight
end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However,
you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday
against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way
and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend
you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent.
However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer
downfield for great stats this week.

Dominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should
definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats,
but should give good rushing totals and a score.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in
recent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game
Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend
these two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be
Clark.

Dwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Carswell might factor into the Broncos' passing game more Thursday against
Dallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver. However, he had no catches in
similar circumstances in Week 10, and the Cowboys will be ready to defend
short passes to him. Only use Carswell if you're thin at the tight end
position.

Keith Poole, WR DEN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
If Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday's game against Dallas, Poole will need
to step up as the Broncos' top receiving target. However, we don't
recommend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a
reliable point-producer. Keep Poole reserved against Dallas.

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Don't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. he has been inconsistent
this season, and may not do much against a physical Pittsburgh defense.

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Mason should post respectable statistics against the Steelers. Don't expect
him to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense.

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Alstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't
expect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,
scoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. 

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Johnson threw for 399 yards last week against Chicago, but he also threw no
touchdowns and was picked off twice. He's been unreliable from a Fantasy
standpoint, and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Johnson had a big game against Chicago last weekend, catching 12 passes for
89 yards. He was held out of the end zone again, but look for that to
change on Monday night against St. Louis. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New
England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,
so avoid starting him if at all possible. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Holt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend against
New England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and is
worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Bruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven
catches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against
a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. 

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gary will likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas, but
we don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats. The Cowboys will
probably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky
starts this week since they have been splitting time.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
With favorite target Rod Smith likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have
questionable receivers to work with Thursday against Dallas. However, the
Cowboys' defense will probably focus on the run and force Griese to beat
them through the air. He should provide your team with decent stats and is
worth using this week.

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Faulk had 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against New England last
weekend. He's the best player in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in
any league format. 

Jamel White, RB CLE - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
The Browns may use White as a change-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar
Bengals run defense. You might want to consider him as a third running back
option on your team if you're lacking in starting options.

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, and is now listed as questionable for
Monday's game against Tampa Bay due to a shoulder injury. With the lack of
depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is
something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do if he's
healthy. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401
yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and
will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent
secondary. 

O.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Santiago catches the occasional pass for the Browns and could find the end
zone every now or then. He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati
secondary, so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores. Only use
Santiago if you're desperate for a tight end, however, as he rarely gets a
big yardage total.

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Johnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game
this season, and is now a very reliable No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver.
Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the
Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get him into your lineup.

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Couch has a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards,
four TDs), whom he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks
you could choose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week,
give him a look.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Warrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't
provided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league.
His matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him
reserved this week.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Although Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games
against the Browns, whom he plays Sunday, we can't recommend you use him
this week. He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from
a Fantasy perspective.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
We can't advise you use Kitna as he goes up against the Browns' secondary
this week. Cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year,
leading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the
Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678
rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in
your active lineup week in and week out in any league.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Centers has been a great pass-catching back for the Bills this season, but
he will face a Miami defense on Sunday that will likely be able to contain
him. Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks,
logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a bigger
challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reserving him.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
There's a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week
against a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent
limited role in the Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he
has a good history against the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and
he might be worth using as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.

Eric Johnson, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina.
Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth
starting at this point. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Stokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for 72 yards
and two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable overall,
however, so starting him is still a risky move. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Henry had a very disappointing game against the Seahawks in Week 10, and
will likely struggle again against the far-better Dolphins defense on
Sunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit using this week.

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a
strong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar
Seahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this
week despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the
bench for Week 11.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
After a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self.
We don't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so
don't use him this week.

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Sharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving
touchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced
Jacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe
into your active lineup every week.

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly
developing into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot
streak and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you
get Ismail into your starting lineup this week.

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Buckhalter will return from suspension this weekend, and will be available
for Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Staley has established himself
as the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhalter is a gamble. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Staley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in
Philadelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes
him worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Just when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two catches for 17 yards
like he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will still be in the
starting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gamble nonetheless. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Barber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a
touchdown in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run
this season, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their
offense in Week 11. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Toomer caught five balls for 60 yards against Minnesota on Monday night,
but he'll struggle to post similar numbers vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a
formidable secondary, so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a
wise move. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Collins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321
yards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into
the end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a
result, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Jackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does
have the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a
deeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Horn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing
through them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two
touchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against
New England based on his potential to post huge numbers. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Bennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the
NFL style of game. He's been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely
worth a roster spot at this point. He'll do nothing against Chicago's
aggressive run defense, so don't bother starting him. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Culpepper finally had a breakout game last week, connecting on four
touchdown passes against the N.Y. Giants. He should have success against
Chicago's secondary on Sunday, so be sure to include him when you choose
your Week 11 starting lineup. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
The Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament
in his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery
in the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him
awaiting his return.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Glenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the pre-practice
walkthrough on Wednesday, according to published reports. He is unlikely to
play Sunday against New Orleans and shouldn't be on anyone's Fantasy roster
at this point.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Chamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the N.Y.
Giants, but he's expected to play this weekend vs. Chicago. Chamberlain has
been unreliable of late, and getting open against Chicago's tough
linebacking group won't be an easy task. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157
yards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same
Lions, whose defense is questionable at best. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Favre had a somewhat rough outing last weekend, throwing three
interceptions against Atlanta. However, he's still one of the best Fantasy
quarterbacks in the league, and he should bounce back on Thanksgiving
against Detroit. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Freeman has been solid of late, catching four touchdown passes in his last
five games. He's a must start against Detroit's vulnerable pass defense in
Week 11. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Franks has cooled off considerably in recent weeks, but his potential to
find the end zone still makes him a good Fantasy player. Unless you have a
better option, starting Franks is advisable. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend
against Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in
the league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Batch had a huge game against Arizona last weekend, but he's been
inconsistent this season for the most part. He's better off used when the
matchup is right, so facing a tough Green Bay defense may not bode well for
his Fantasy numbers.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Morton had a big game against Arizona last weekend, and has been a
surprisingly reliable Fantasy player this season. He may struggle against
Green Bay's tough pass defense, but he's still worth taking a gamble on in
Week 11. 

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Howard is not expected to miss an extended period of time due to his
shoulder injury. He hasn't practitced this week, however, and is listed as
doubtful for Thursday's game against Green Bay. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Emanuel, who suffered a sprained left knee during last weekend's game
against Arizona, will miss at least four weeks of action. There was a
chance that he'd be out for the season, but now he's expected to return in
mid-to-late December. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Stewart (ankle) practiced on Tuesday and feels as though he's ready to
return to action. ""I feel pretty good,"" Stewart told the <I>Detroit Free
Press</I>. ""It felt better than I thought. I'm just going to see, let (the
medical staff and coach Marty Mornhinweg) decide whether I play or not.""
His carries may be down a bit in his first game back, but he's worth
starting in deeper leagues, barring any setbacks. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Hambrick will return to fullback/backup duties on Thursday against Denver.
With Emmitt Smith expected to play, Hambrick isn't worth starting on your
Fantasy team in Week 11. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Galloway is a shell of his former self, catching only 24 passes through his
first seven games this season. Dallas' pathetic quarterbacks have been the
real reason for Galloway's subpar numbers, making him a huge gamble from a
Fantasy perspective. Unless you're desperate, don't consider starting
Galloway in Week 11. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but starting him is still
a gamble from a Fantasy perspective. Dallas has the worst pass offense in
the league, so playing Ismail isn't advisable unless you're desperate. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Miller put up solid numbers last weekend against Tampa Bay, throwing for
228 yards and three touchdowns. Miller has been inconsistent this season,
but starting him in Week 11 against a shaky Minnesota secondary is
definitely worth considering.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Thomas' yardage numbers have slipped in the last two weeks, but he's still
worth starting in Week 11 vs. Minnesota. The Vikings are giving up 124.3
yards rushing per game, so look for the Bears to run Thomas early and
often. 

Dez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
White is dealing with a slight ankle injury, but he's expected to play
against Minnesota. The Vikings secondary has been vulnerable to the pass
this season, so starting White in a deeper league is worth considering. 

Isaac Byrd, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Byrd will likely start in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad in Week 11
against Atlanta. The Falcons pass defense is one of the worst units in the
league, so Byrd could actually put up some decent Fantasy numbers. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Walls put up only two catches for 30 yards last weekend, but he did find
the end zone for the fifth time this season. Unless you've got a better
option, starting Walls on a weekly basis is advisable. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Smith had a mediocre game last weekend vs. Green Bay, but he's likely to
bounce back against Carolina. The Panthers have the worst run defense in
the league, so Smith should have no problem putting up solid Fantasy
numbers in Week 11. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he
could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one
of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues
may be worth considering. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on
Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary hasn't been playing well
of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is
advisable.

Hi Paul,
 
Ran into ""Tim"" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our ""get together"" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
 
Take care,

Subject:	Kennedy Oil

Eric,

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a ""Discussion Document"" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell
(303) 575-6478

Let's look to try and meet early rather than later, but who knows.  Also what about lining up properties between $200,000 and $350,000.  Thenw eeding them out based upon age and number of bedrooms (3).  If you can shoot us the listings first so Mark and I can narrow them down to around 10.

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

Crude Oil Futures Rally on Anticipated OPEC Cut

Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX climbed $1.65 to 
$21.27 per barrel yesterday in its biggest gain in over a year amid 
signs that OPEC will proceed with plans to cut production by 1.5 
million bpd in a bid to lift sagging crude prices. To avoid losing 
market share, the cartel had demanded that non-OPEC producers 
contribute a cut of 500,000 bpd between them before it would make any 
further slices in its own production. So far, Russia, Mexico, Norway, 
Oman and Angola have committed to a combined 462,500 curb in exports, 
which appears to be enough to allow OPEC to go ahead with their 
plans. The ministers are scheduled to meet in Cairo on Friday and are 
expected to take that opportunity to announce their cut. The IEA 
projects that world demand will rise by 600,000 bpd next year, about 
30% below the average annual gain during the 1990's, as the largest 
oil consumers, the US and Japan are mired in a recession. The CFTC 
has reported that traders sold more crude oil futures contracts on 
the NYMEX than they bought in the week ended December 18th, producing 
the highest net short position levels since the contracts began 
trading in 1983. Heating oil futures for January delivery on the 
NYMEX jumped $0.0462, or 8.4%, to $0.5946 per gallon as colder 
weather arrived in most of the eastern portion of the US. The 
increase in heating oil was the biggest gain since last April. 
January gasoline futures on the NYMEX rose $0.0427 to $0.6013 per 
gallon. In London, the IPE was closed in observance of Boxing Day.

World Heating Fuel Projections 
 

    The eastern half of the US will continue to experience colder 
weather for the next several days resulting in strong heating fuel 
consumption. Temperatures are expected to be 8 to 16 degrees below 
average from the central Plains to the mid-Atlantic region southward 
to the Gulf of Mexico. New England, the upper Midwest and the 
northern Plains will be a little milder than normal, but heating fuel 
demand will remain higher than usual. Mild weather is expected 
throughout the western states decreasing demand for heating fuel. In 
Canada, above normal temperatures into early January will keep 
heating fuel consumption lower than normal. A cool-weather bias will 
remain in far southeastern Canada for the several days producing 
above normal demand for heating fuels. Milder weather in western 
Europe will significantly reduce heating fuel consumption during the 
next 7 to 10 days. In the UK and France, temperatures will be close 
to normal through January 5th. Germany and eastern Europe will 
experience colder temperatures, but some reduction in heating fuels 
demand will occur. Temperatures in Scandinavia will average from 4 to 
8 degrees Celsius below normal producing strong heating oil 
consumption through early January. China's weather will continue to 
be colder than usual, with temperatures expected to average from 4 to 
8 degrees Celsius below normal for the next 10 days. Japans usage of 
heating fuel is projected to higher than normal through January 5th. 
Most of the country will be 2 to 5 degrees Celsius below average.

Saudi Minister Says OPEC to Announce Cuts in Cairo

    Comments made by the Saudi oil minister seem to indicate that 
OPEC is ready to go ahead with a planned production cut of 1.5 
million bpd after receiving commitments from non-member producers to 
also reduce exports. The minister said that OPEC would announce the 
reductions at a meeting in Cairo on Friday. The remarks put an end to 
a threatened price war between the cartel and non-OPEC producers. The 
cartel had accused the non-aligned producers of taking advantage of 
curbs already implemented this year by OPEC to grab a larger share of 
the market. The cartel had demanded that the non-member producing 
countries trim 500,000 bpd from exports before it would once again 
slice production. To date Russia, Mexico, Norway, Oman and Angola 
have pledged cuts totaling 462,500 bpd, which appears to be enough to 
convince OPEC to proceed with its cut. The ministers also seem to be 
comfortable with the level of commitment by the non-members to stick 
to their quotas for the specified 6-month period. The new 
restrictions will lower exports for 10 OPEC producers to 21.7 million 
bpd, down 5 million bpd or 19% from a year ago, the lowest level in 
10 years. Iraq, the 11th member produces at will because of UN 
sanctions. The new supply limits are designed to lift prices back to 
$20-$25 per barrel for the basket of OPEC crude oils.

Philadelphia Oil Service Index Climbs to August Levels
 
    The Philadelphia Oil Service Index climbed as high as 89.85, its 
highest level since August, closing at 89.41, up 3.8% yesterday. 
Shares of Rowan added $0.77 to $19.70 and Schlumberger stocks gained 
$2.85 to $55.95. Integrated oil stocks also gained, as the CBOE Oil 
Index was up 1.3% to 300.2. ChevronTexaco rose $0.65 to $89.20 and 
ExxonMobil advanced $0.60 cents to $39.60. On the NYMEX, February 
crude oil rose to session high at $21.43 per barrel, its highest 
level in 6 weeks. It closed at $21.27, up $1.65, or 8.6%. 
Expectations that OPEC will proceed with a planned production cut of 
1.5 million bpd at a meeting in Cairo on Friday likely gave the 
market a lift. Although non-OPEC producers are a little short of the 
500,000 bpd reduction that OPEC demanded, it appears that they came 
close enough, with a combined pledge to cut 462,500 bpd, to satisfy 
the cartel.

Egypt Increases Oil Reserves 

    Egypt's Oil Ministry says new oil and condensate finds with 
recoverable reserves of 178 million barrels, and natural gas reserves 
of 1.5 Tcf have been discovered. About 15 wells had been drilled, of 
which 7 were now producing at a total of 16,000 bpd.  The oil 
discoveries were made in the Gulf of Suez and the country's western 
and eastern deserts, and the natural gas discoveries were made in the 
Nile Delta area, western desert and in the Mediterranean sea. Egypt 
produced about 640,000 barrels of oil per day in November. It has 
proven natural gas reserves of 53.3 Tcf, and oil reserves of 3.8 
billion barrels.

UDS Refinery Restart Delayed

    Ultramar Diamond Shamrock has run into problems trying to restart 
the fluid catalytic cracker at its Golden Eagle refinery near San 
Francisco following scheduled maintenance work. The catalytic cracker 
and an alkylation unit had to be closed down, contributing to a rise 
in wholesale gasoline prices in the area. A new attempt to restart 
the FCC is expected today. UDS announced in November that it had 
shutdown the FCC at the 170,000 bpd refinery for scheduled 
maintenance work and that would be followed by maintenance work on 
the hydrocracker at the same refinery. Wholesale CARB gasoline prices 
in San Francisco rose by over $0.04 per gallon yesterday.

Taiwan Deregulates Oil Market

     Taiwan's economics ministry has announced the full opening of 
the oil market to foreign-refined products, heaping pressure on state-
run giant Chinese Petroleum Corp to speed up deregulation. The 
privatization of Taiwan's oil products came after passage of the oil 
management law in September, which would open the floodgates to 
imports of gasoline, diesel and kerosene, and expand the island 
nation's already crowded energy market. After the opening, any 
company, which has facilities to store 60 days of reserves or 50 
million liters of the oil products, is allowed to buy them from 
foreign refiners, said the Energy Commission. In 1999, the government 
cut restrictions on imports of jet fuel, fuel oil and LPG as part of 
its drive to meet requirements for entry into the WTO. The complete 
deregulation was set to further erode market share of dominant 
supplier CPC. CPC, faced with a saturated domestic market and 
increasing competition, will have to accelerate its privatization or 
see a further erosion of dominance in the local oil market. CPC says 
it plans to sell as much as a 50% stake overseas in the second half 
of 2002.

Paul,

We have the above Sep-01 production deal on WIC pipeline in the system under CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company.  However, the counterparty is billing us under CMS Field Services, Inc.  These two counterparties settle differently.  Please confirm the correct counterparty name if possible.

"FW: New Year's at Marlowe's!!","Didn't get anything for this Friday, but here is the flyer for New Years.



Organizers of the first"" National Orgasm Week"" held this year were very
disappointed with the results obtained.
It seems at least three quarters of the women polled just pretended to
celebrate it.


  Everyone loves champagne during the Holiday season! Do we have a present
for you !!!!!! Compliments of Korbel. When you come to Marlowe's New Year's
Eve after work between 4:00 and 6:00 and bring two friends, you will receive
a complimentary half bottle of the bubbly. If you bring in 4 friends you
will  recieve a full bottle .Be sure to invite everyone. The more the
merrier.

  For us fans of ""Sex In The City"", new episodes start January 5th. Yeah !!

 Please bring your e-mail in and present it to the server or bartender.
Looking forward to seeing you. Happy New Year!

Eric,

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a ""Discussion Document"" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell
(303) 575-6478

Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Peerless Price <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.

Eric Moulds <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.

Larry Centers <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league! =g! etbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1072&>, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE Jay Riemersma.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1041&>, QB NE - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
There's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this week . Bledsoe was upgraded from ""out"" to ""doubtful"" on the injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined. Bledsoe's progress has been slower than ! he! hoped and there's no timetable for his return. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of an injured right knee. ""Tyrone Wheatley has a second degree - I don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,""' coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday. Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progressed. He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks. ""I would not agree with that at this time,"" Gruden said. 

Chris Weinke <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain whether he will play in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke cannot play.

Brian Griese <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's confident he'll play Sunday against San Diego. Griese complained of shoulder soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks defensive end Lamar Kin! g.! Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his shoulder. 

Redskins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go. 

Rob Moore <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/17/01
Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/17/01
Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible. 

Chris Weinke <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=play! er! s&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=235174&> , QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. 

Terance Mathis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/17/01
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective. 

Shawn ! Je! fferson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise. 

Ryan Leaf <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time. 

Troy Hambrick <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=194768&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point. 

Michael Bennett <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.

Randy Moss <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/17/01
Moss is! l! isted as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start. 

Shane Matthews <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Terrell Davis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you! s! tart any Broncos running back.

Stacey Mack <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous. 

Keenan McCardell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes. 

Sean Dawkins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9! &r! andom=3411&key=1230&>, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone. 

Mark Brunell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1032&>, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/17/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score. 

Kyle Brady <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too produ! ct! ive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Herman Moore <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1222&>, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantas! y ! team. Larry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Charlie Garner <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/17/01
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Travis Henry <http://football215.f! an! tasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=235216&>, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.

Charlie Garner <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1149&>, Active RB Updated 10/17/01
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Rob Moore <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1183&>, Active WR Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet. 

Duce Staley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1757&>, Active RB Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie. 

Steve McNair <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1069&>, Active QB Updated 10/14/01
McNair finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, compiling 284 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against Tampa Bay. He's still not a reliable weekly option Fantasy-wise, so use him only if the matchup is right. 

Kurt Warner <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=12797&>, Active QB Updated 10/14/01
Warner left Sunday's game against the N.Y. Giants in the fourth quarter after having the wind knocked out of him. However, he returned to action after being sidelined for only one play. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1785&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01
Hilliard, who was dealing with a slight oblique strain, played on Sunday against St. Louis. He caught three passes for 49 yards and a score in New York's 15-14 loss. 

Nick Goings <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=237114&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/14/01
Goings was declared inactive for the game against New Orleans. Tim Biakabutuka and Richard Huntley are getting carries at halfback.

Mike Alstott <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1169&>, Active RB Updated 10/12/01
Alstott will once again be the Bucs' featured back in Warrick Dunn's absence. He may not post good yardage numbers against Tennessee, but Alstott does have a good shot at putting up a touchdown against the Titans. 

Cris Carter <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1248&>, Active WR Updated 10/12/01
Carter has struggled, but he's too good not to start on a weekly basis. Look for him to find the end zone against Detroit on Sunday. 

Marty Booker <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=133228&>, Active WR Updated 10/12/01
Booker has been one of the season's early sleepers Fantasy-wise. He'll have a great chance at posting bug numbers against a shaky Arizona secondary, so give him the starting nod this week. 

Desmond Clark <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=133250&>, Active TE Updated 10/12/01
Consider Clark as a starter this week. The Seahawks are soft over the middle and in the red zone, where Clark can be effective.

Ravens <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=3&>, Active DT Updated 10/07/01
Linebacker Ray Lewis (elbow) was in the starting lineup for Baltimore in Sunday's game against Tennessee. Baltimore's defense looks spectacular early on, and could put up some big Fantasy points against the Titans. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=12411&>, Active WR Updated 09/08/01
Hakim might see a few passes thrown his way during the Rams' season opener Sunday in Philadelphia. However, his offensive potential is limited as a No. 3 receiving threat, so his Fantasy ceiling isn't very high.

David Akers <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3411&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

"Re: Picture","Why in the world would I want a picture of you at one of your gay bars?????    So did you crop out your backdoor man?
Really quit trying to hit on me. I'm not bi.  

Or is that a picture of you at the new Vail condo? If it's at the Vail condo then it's ok that you're gay.  

So what's up with you? I see the ski trip is starting to take form. You know we have to go meet the All Girl Ski team.
So are you getting ready for them? Damn they about killed me last time. Those steep, tight tree trails. And then the last run of the day - the ski run from hell.    

I was just thinking. Have you ever been to my place? (reminder to Pual: Donnie is not gay) One of these days if you're in town maybe a group of us could go out to eat or something.  

Later  
Heavy D

always learning something new - right now it's the guitar. I'm also
really happy being alone with myself to read, write, or just putz

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Andy Neely, San Diego, CA 

I've got so much talent at RB I'm not sure who to start this weekend. Marshall Faulk is a no-brainer, but that leaves me to choose among Eddie George, Mike Anderson and Garrison Hearst. Eddie would be my first choice, but he is nursing an injury and going up against a good Tampa Bay defense. 

Answer - GG 

You're right to have doubts about George this week. Hearst has looked good in his last two games, but he's not finding the end zone and continues to split carries with Kevan Barlow. That leaves Anderson, who has the best chance at posting solid Fantasy numbers against a Seattle defense that has been very inconsistent through the first four weeks of the season. 


Question - Robert Smith, Philadelphia, PA 

I have Frank Wycheck. He has not produced the way I thought he would this year, and his health is uncertain. Should I pick up Erron Kinney or Dwayne Carswell and drop Wycheck? 

Answer - GG 

Wycheck is dealing with a strained neck, but he's expected to start this weekend against Tampa Bay. Erron Kinney is emerging as a solid pass-catching tight end, but Wycheck is still one of Tennessee's most reliable receiving threats and is far too valuable to simply drop. He's averaged nearly 70 receptions over the past three years and is still a top-tier Fantasy player. 


Question - Joe Serodio, Boston, MA 

I had Jamal Anderson as my No. 1 back, but ever since his injury I've had to use Jerome Bettis and Thomas Jones as my starters. I was offered Mike Alstott and Priest Holmes for Bill Schroeder. What should I do? 

Answer - GG 

Depending on the depth of your receivers, we'd suggest making this deal if it's the best trade you can negotiate. Alstott will be Tampa Bay's featured back for at least another week, and Holmes seems to have secured the No. 1 spot in Kansas City with Tony Richardson's recent injury. Schroeder has been a great Fantasy player thus far, but it'll be tough for him to keep up his current pace. While it may be tough to let him go, dealing Schroeder for Alstott and Holmes is the best move you can make to ease the loss of Anderson. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Dave Slater, Pittsburgh, PA: Hines Ward is one of the most underrated receivers in the league. He already has 24 receptions this season, and it's just a matter of time before those receptions turn into touchdowns. Pittsburgh's offense may not be the best, but Ward is the best receiving threat on their roster and will develop into a reliable Fantasy player.

"RE: Spark Spread Options","



Hi,

	 	The power options trading desk is beginning to structure deals and to make markets in spark spread options ( options on the spreads between power prices and natural gas prices).  Please refer to the attached file for further information.   
	

 	   	It would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals  on the Gas desk  who would be interested in spark spread options.

   	
	 	 Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk

"Northern Border/Ventura/Harper Gas","Gerry, I talked to both storey and Lucci late friday... here is the latest.  You had indicated your customer wanted a monthly related price... is that off of Ventura or Harper or both.   

Paul Lucci ( Denver office) will contact you today or Tues., to generate a bid for the Ventura and Harper gas. I talked to storey on Friday and he will work up a firm bid for your customers.   He thinks pricing will be near a Ventura Monthly Index + $ .04. ( that's with no orig to Canada).  That is also with no ancillary deals behind this structure and that is what Lucci is trying to pull together. Paul, can you please investigate nom procedures, potential dry run structure ( Oct. 01) and verify what the structure looks like as the upstream diversions take place.( incl. default positions ).    

At a minimum let's buy the gas and sell it base load to storey.... then ENA - Denver will try to back fill some gas into the deal on a Interruptible basis.

Call if you guys want to discuss. 

regard,  BT

Latest NFL Player News

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/24/01
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He
will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress
in his recovery and might play this week.

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to
the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's
absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a
chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer.
Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside
Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for
Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on
Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will
be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib
Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the
Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He
is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice
tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it
will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach
Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game
against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any
problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>Tacoma News Tribune</I>, Seahawks Head Coach Mike
Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as
he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I
didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he
got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would
suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster
room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure
you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost
the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy
rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game
against Miami, according to the <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</I>. He
replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with
a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a
Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at
Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the
concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss
Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point
in the season.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected
to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of
Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend
you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is
hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this
week.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a
sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken
ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback
game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided
whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the
Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't
recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain
he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring
strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the
week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish
it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled
late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11
carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to
post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster
allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this
week. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury.
However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's
game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in
this week's game. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's
game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
<i>The Tennessean</i> reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back.
The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment
options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to
play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder
showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status
for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to
week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom
Coughlin told <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. ""It remains to be seen when
Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well
this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return
date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his
groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to
play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told <i>The Baltimore
Sun</i> he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game.
Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained
ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at
running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against
Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm
feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be
something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown
a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will
replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York
Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game
against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</I>, Canidate is expected to
start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I
wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said.
""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to
let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved
himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be
starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close
to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was
a blessing for me because I was able to get treatment every day,"" Stokes
told the <I>Contra Costa Times</I>. ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say
I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre,
however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to
be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants'
starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on
Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his
surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a
sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game
against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week
ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this
game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to
let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is
he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling
in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so
starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable. 

Dez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>, White will start in place of the
injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching
abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper
leagues. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/23/01
Terrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus
Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. <I>The Chicago Sun-Times</I> is now
reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell
being used as the team's third receiver. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The
team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game
against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular
season game this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring
injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see
him by now, McGinnis told the <I>Arizona Republic</I>. ""That's why we both
handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning
to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he
can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still
on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday
night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron
Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge
of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week
Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the
standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden
opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks
to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.
The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep
him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress
during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seven.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice
this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye
on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,""
Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>. ""Warrick
pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who
it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured,
so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week
Seven.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at
Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he
should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK,"" Favre told the <I>Milwaukee
Journal-Sentinel</I>. ""Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that
will help.""

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a
sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren
finished the game in his absence.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Despite a great performance by Thomas Sunday against Cincinnati, the
<I>Chicago Tribune</I> reports that the Bears will continue to use an
alternating system with him and James Allen. ""We will continue to use them
both,"" said offensive coordinator John Shoop. ""Anthony did a great job
today, though."" As long as this duo continues to split carries, it's hard
to recommend either as a weekly starter in a Fantasy league. We believe
Thomas is the better long-term pick, though.

Brad Hoover, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Hoover left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury is not
believed to be serious. Monitor Hoover's situation. He might get some
carries now that starter Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the season. 

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Baxter returned from muscle spasms Sunday against Cincinnati, and had a
one-yard TD reception in the game. Despite the solid performance, he's
still not a reliable weekly starter in a Fantasy league.

Robert Wilson, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Wilson suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game and was held to a 24-yard
reception. He is also recovering from a broken thumb. Wilson will be
evaluated on a daily basis. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 10/22/01
Cleeland suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered
to be serious. He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception.
Cleeland will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/22/01
Terrell will start at wide receiver in place of injured Marcus Robinson in
Sunday's game against San Francisco. If you're a Robinson owner, consider
adding Terrell to your squad. The rookie had seven receptions for 91 yards
on Sunday.

Neil Rackers, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
According to published reports, the Bengals are becoming frustrated with
Rackers' erratic play. The team might look into signing another kicker.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Jones sprained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Scott suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss
next week's game against Detroit.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/22/01
Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry
for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Grbac is day to day with a rib contusion. His status for next week's game
is uncertain. Randall Cunningham would start if Grbac can't play.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/22/01
Allen is day to day with a sprained left ankle. According to the
<i>Baltimore Sun</i>, the Ravens have been shopping for RB help, indicating
Allen's status as a starter is anything but firm.

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Christian suffered a sprained neck in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated
on a daily basis. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Jefferson aggravated back, left ankle and big toe injuries Sunday and also
burst the bursa sac in his right elbow. He might not be at full strength,
but Jefferson is expected to play when the Falcons return from their bye on
November 4. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in the
Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again
until November 4. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/22/01
Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't
necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball
successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for
Bruce to do better next week against the Saints. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/22/01
Detroit Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg said Monday that Crowell tore the
patella tendon in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season.
Crowell suffered the injury while leaping for a pass in the end zone in the
second half of Sunday's game. The Lions will use a combination of Larry
Foster, Scotty Anderson and Desmond Howard in his absence.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Robinson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral
ligament in his left knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and
will miss the rest of the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field
with six minutes left in the first half after the injury. Marty Booker will
be the primary receiver in his absence.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in
goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards.
He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has
clearly emerged as a featured back.

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/22/01
Williams, who was averaging 4.5 yards a carry, gained just 51 yards on 21
carries Sunday, a 2.4-yard average. He had eight carries for 5 yards in the
second half. ""We couldn't do anything in the second half,"" Williams said.
""We didn't block right a few times, other times they filled holes and made
plays."" Look for Williams to rebound and have a solid game against the Rams
this Sunday. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Chandler had another solid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and
39 yards. He also completed 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to
be an adequate starter for the rest of the season. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/22/01
Biakabutuka broke his foot in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game after
rushing for 121 yards and a touchdown. He is to have surgery Monday and is
out for the season. 

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective
at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to
prove himself as a Fantasy player.

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was
good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games
this year and has become a major scoring threat even though he is not very
effective outside of the red zone.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a
touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however,
but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona.
Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a
starting nod every week. 

Doug Chapman, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers
were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so
far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot
stay healthy or continues to struggle.

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131
yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league
and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards
of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with
any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107
yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to
start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/21/01
Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on
Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's
still one of the top Fantasy players in the league. 

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a
score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a
Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Griese (shoulder) started Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was
ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions
in Denver's 27-10 loss. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the
potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not
find the end zone often. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran
runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus
Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the
Chicago passing game.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly
establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears'
featured back for the rest of the year.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/21/01
Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit. Despite some
quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE,
especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to
Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but
he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/21/01
McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He
completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate,
possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a
reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production
this year. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The
speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good
numbers from him every week.

Alge Crumpler, TE ATL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans.
Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the
year.

Albert Connell, WR NO - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is
definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the
Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate
Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/21/01
Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still
making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is
limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week,
but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh
defense.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards
and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his
potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position
lacking quality players. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed
a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout
should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He
also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile
good numbers against any defense.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of
total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be
short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.

"Breakthrough receiver puts Internet radio on home stereos","  <http://www.technoscout.com/images/scout/TechnoHeader_Small.gif>

Scouting Report Special Edition---Where technology hits home.

Every year, the worlds most innovative electronics companies meet in Las Vegas to unveil their newest creations. The Consumer Electronics Show features thousands of new products and is attended by every major retailer in the world. Unfortunately, most of these retailers are limited by a lack of shelf space and convoluted distribution systems. By the time the newest technology makes it to their stores, it is not so new. That is not the case at TechnoScout.com, where you can find the latest, greatest, neatest and coolest products, often before they are available in stores. Here is one of our favorite products from this years show. 
  _____  

Your radio just got 5,000 new stations 

The iRhythm Wireless Remote Tuner makes it easy to listen to the best programs in the world in high fidelity without hard-wired connections.

If you believe you have been missing something great from your PC and Internet connection, you may be right. It is radio from stations throughout North America and around the world in high fidelity. If you know about Net radio, you realize that hundreds of radio stations from everywhere in the world are broadcast over the Internet. The trouble is, you have to surf the Web to find them (that can take hours). Then you have to listen to them in front of your PC over small speakers. The iRhythm Wireless Internet Remote Tuner from Sonicbox solves both of these problems effortlessly. The system gives you the software and components to turn your stereo into a high fidelity receiver of Best of Planet TM Internet radio stations. Even more, you do not need a high-speed Internet connection, and there is no wiring necessary between your PC and stereo. Once you set up the iRhythm Remote Tuner you can dial up any station on the Internet without touching your computer as long as it is turn! ed on. A handheld RF remote control lets you switch stations from anywhere in your house up to 100 feet away from your computer (through walls and floors), using the same kind of 900 MHz frequency used on cordless telephones.

Update!  Jeff the DUI guy wants to party, so no go on the driving.  Like I guessed, Nat and Lorena are going to pass on the limo.  So, taxi is probably the best bet.  We're meeting at Nat's place in the early evening to ""get ready"" and then planning to hit the bars and maybe a couple of parties.  Are you going to join us?   Do you know of anything going on?

Latest NFL Player News

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Barber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a
touchdown in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run
this season, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their
offense in Week 11. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Toomer caught five balls for 60 yards against Minnesota on Monday night,
but he'll struggle to post similar numbers vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a
formidable secondary, so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a
wise move. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Collins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321
yards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into
the end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a
result, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Jackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does
have the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a
deeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Horn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing
through them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two
touchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against
New England based on his potential to post huge numbers. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Bennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the
NFL style of game. He's been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely
worth a roster spot at this point. He'll do nothing against Chicago's
aggressive run defense, so don't bother starting him. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Culpepper finally had a breakout game last week, connecting on four
touchdown passes against the N.Y. Giants. He should have success against
Chicago's secondary on Sunday, so be sure to include him when you choose
your Week 11 starting lineup. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
The Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament
in his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery
in the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him
awaiting his return.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Glenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the pre-practice
walkthrough on Wednesday, according to published reports. He is unlikely to
play Sunday against New Orleans and shouldn't be on anyone's Fantasy roster
at this point.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Chamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the N.Y.
Giants, but he's expected to play this weekend vs. Chicago. Chamberlain has
been unreliable of late, and getting open against Chicago's tough
linebacking group won't be an easy task. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157
yards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same
Lions, whose defense is questionable at best. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Favre had a somewhat rough outing last weekend, throwing three
interceptions against Atlanta. However, he's still one of the best Fantasy
quarterbacks in the league, and he should bounce back on Thanksgiving
against Detroit. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Freeman has been solid of late, catching four touchdown passes in his last
five games. He's a must start against Detroit's vulnerable pass defense in
Week 11. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Franks has cooled off considerably in recent weeks, but his potential to
find the end zone still makes him a good Fantasy player. Unless you have a
better option, starting Franks is advisable. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend
against Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in
the league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Batch had a huge game against Arizona last weekend, but he's been
inconsistent this season for the most part. He's better off used when the
matchup is right, so facing a tough Green Bay defense may not bode well for
his Fantasy numbers.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Morton had a big game against Arizona last weekend, and has been a
surprisingly reliable Fantasy player this season. He may struggle against
Green Bay's tough pass defense, but he's still worth taking a gamble on in
Week 11. 

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Howard is not expected to miss an extended period of time due to his
shoulder injury. He hasn't practitced this week, however, and is listed as
doubtful for Thursday's game against Green Bay. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Emanuel, who suffered a sprained left knee during last weekend's game
against Arizona, will miss at least four weeks of action. There was a
chance that he'd be out for the season, but now he's expected to return in
mid-to-late December. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Stewart (ankle) practiced on Tuesday and feels as though he's ready to
return to action. ""I feel pretty good,"" Stewart told the <I>Detroit Free
Press</I>. ""It felt better than I thought. I'm just going to see, let (the
medical staff and coach Marty Mornhinweg) decide whether I play or not.""
His carries may be down a bit in his first game back, but he's worth
starting in deeper leagues. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Hambrick will return to fullback/backup duties on Thursday against Denver.
With Emmitt Smith expected to play, Hambrick isn't worth starting on your
Fantasy team in Week 11. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Galloway is a shell of his former self, catching only 24 passes through his
first seven games this season. Dallas' pathetic quarterbacks have been the
real reason for Galloway's subpar numbers, making him a huge gamble from a
Fantasy perspective. Unless you're desperate, don't consider starting
Galloway in Week 11. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but starting him is still
a gamble from a Fantasy perspective. Dallas has the worst pass offense in
the league, so playing Ismail isn't advisable unless you're desperate. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Miller put up solid numbers last weekend against Tampa Bay, throwing for
228 yards and three touchdowns. Miller has been inconsistent this season,
but starting him in Week 11 against a shaky Minnesota secondary is
definitely worth considering.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Thomas' yardage numbers have slipped in the last two weeks, but he's still
worth starting in Week 11 vs. Minnesota. The Vikings are giving up 124.3
yards rushing per game, so look for the Bears to run Thomas early and
often. 

Dez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
White is dealing with a slight ankle injury, but he's expected to play
against Minnesota. The Vikings secondary has been vulnerable to the pass
this season, so starting White in a deeper league is worth considering. 

Isaac Byrd, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Byrd will likely start in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad in Week 11
against Atlanta. The Falcons pass defense is one of the worst units in the
league, so Byrd could actually put up some decent Fantasy numbers. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Walls put up only two catches for 30 yards last weekend, but he did find
the end zone for the fifth time this season. Unless you've got a better
option, starting Walls on a weekly basis is advisable. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Smith had a mediocre game last weekend vs. Green Bay, but he's likely to
bounce back against Carolina. The Panthers have the worst run defense in
the league, so Smith should have no problem putting up solid Fantasy
numbers in Week 11. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he
could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one
of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues
may be worth considering. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on
Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary hasn't been playing well
of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is
advisable. 

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy Football.
He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last two games,
and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11. 

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will
remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring
injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless
from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against
the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.

 Dolphins, DT MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the season due
to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to rest
and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's absence
hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more by
opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's game against Seattle due to
the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 11 game against the Jets. He
will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at split end, and you should
keep him reserved for this week.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against
Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he
couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps.
Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right
now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe
groin injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the
remainder of the season, according to the <I>Florida Times-Union</I>. The
diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time
to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain in his
hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor
will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold
onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough
bench.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on
Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against
Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's
game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for
this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well
- the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the
season.

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/20/01
With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander
will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their
charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the
Chiefs this week.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 11/20/01
The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain
the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill
Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe
to your roster as an insurance policy if you can.

Jonathan Quinn, QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this
week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/20/01
Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice,
says the <i>Seattle Times</i>. He is not expected to return for another two
to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer
for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 11/20/01
Mike Riley told the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i> there is no QB
controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be
our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want,
but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will
start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not
playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.

Mark Bruener, TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury.
His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is
widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/20/01
Wheatley told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> he is no longer being bothered
by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected
to return to practice early this week.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/20/01
Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky
start in Week 11.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/20/01
The <i>Tennessean</i> says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the
team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect
him to miss any practice time this week. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/20/01
Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against
Seattle.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may
have to start in his place,

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game
against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/20/01
Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve.
Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to
be moved back into the starting lineup. 

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/20/01
Dave Wannstedt told the <i>Miami Herald</i> there is no QB controversy
surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of
hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're
going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/20/01
Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently
healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance
to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the <i>Denver
Post</i>. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a
situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our
team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."" 

Benjamin Gay, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The <i>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i> says Butch Davis won't indicate how much
Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of
the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see."" 

Kevin Lockett, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to
play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real
value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia.
Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been
feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the
'Skins. 

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/20/01
Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full
strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the
matchup is favorable. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 11/20/01
Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session
of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered
serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on
Sunday Indianapolis. 

Cecil Martin, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas.
He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this
weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy
player, but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley. 

 Giants, DT NYG - Team Dick Updated 11/20/01
According to the <I>New York Post</I>, cornerback Jason Sehorn's
surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past
weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either
Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he
continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any
receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/20/01
The <i>Baltimore Sun</i> says there is no indication that Grbac will be
replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough
to start for most Fantasy teams.

Donald Driver, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss
Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a
Fantasy player at this point. 

 Ravens, DT BAL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after
undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of
the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage
than usual. 

 Cowboys, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a
sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for
just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't
expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/20/01
Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. ""I'm not 100
percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job,"" Smith told the <I>Dallas
Morning Star</I>. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to
Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 11/20/01
Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He
may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this
weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the
league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11. 

Terry Hardy, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after missing three games
due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday
against San Diego. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury.
Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster
spot in deeper leagues. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/20/01
Stewart (ankle) is hopeful that he can play returned to practice and may
start Thursday's game against Green Bay. He will work his ankle extensively
in practice prior to Thursday, and is optimistic that he'll be ready to
play. If Stewart is able to go, he's worth starting in if you need a
running back for Week 11. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 11/20/01
Taylor has been told by a medical specialist that he should not return to
action this weekend against Pittsburgh. In fact, Taylor could be out for an
even longer period of time than what was originally diagnosed. Taylor tore
the groin muscle completely off the bone back in Week Two, which is an
injury that normally takes about three months to heal. ""It's going to be
very unfair for anyone to assume he will play any time in the immediate
future,"" said Taylor's agent, Drew Rosenhaus. ""He's just not healthy yet.
He can't run full speed without tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a
very good job in working him but he's still in pain."" Expect Stacey Mack
and Elvis Joseph to continue splitting carries in Taylor's absence. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/20/01
Emanuel is out for Thursday's game against Green Bay due to a sprained
ankle. In fact, the injury is so bad that Emanuel may miss the remiander of
the season, but no definitive word on his condition has been made by the
team.

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/20/01
According to published reports, Muhammad's shoulder injury will likely keep
him out of Sunday's game against Atlanta. That could mean big things for
Donald Hayes and Issac Bryd, who'll start against a questionable Falcons
secondary. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 11/20/01
Cleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'll likely
be replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last week
against Indianapolis. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
According to the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>, Carter expects to start on
Dec. 2 against Washington. Carter, who has been out since October with a
hamstring injury, will serve as the No. 3 quarterback on Thursday vs.
Denver. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/19/01
Hilliard continues to feel some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe,
and it is causing him to limp around a bit. He is still expected to start
in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf
can't be good for his injury. 

Reggie Kelly, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return
to action this weekend against Carolina. He won't make much of a Fantasy
impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01
Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas.
The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to
start this weekend's game against Washington. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the
<i>Tennessean</i> says he will probably miss some practice time this week.
He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

 Packers, DT GB - Uran Man Updated 11/19/01
Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during
Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the
remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting
duties in Butler's absence. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the
<i>Tennessean</i> says he will probably miss some practice time this week.
He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/19/01
Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays
were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day. 

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01
Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's
game against Dallas is unclear.

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/19/01
Mathis had by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70
yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but
he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. If you
play in a deeper league, you may want to consider starting Mathis against
the Panthers' weak pass defense. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against
Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to
day. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/19/01
Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes
for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game,
however, and is listed as day to day. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to
return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more
weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate
Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value
in the offseason. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/19/01
Jackson told the <i>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i> it was a coach's decision
not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle
injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able
to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantasy value
might drop greatly.

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the <I>Dallas Morning
News</I> is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for
the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy
Football. 

Kevin Lockett, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib
injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain
at this time. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told
the <I>Washington Post</I> that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would
be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham
would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive
Fantasy option against the Eagles. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/19/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee.
However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas faces
Denver on Thanksgiving Day. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against
Arizona. He is listed as day to day.

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did
not return to the game, and is listed as day to day. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01
Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is
listed as day to day. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His
status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Paul,
Have you heard anything from Gerald about the contracts?  The deal is almost
over and we still do not have any contracts executed.  Hope you can get this
thing unstruck and moving forward again.


Robert

Latest NFL Player News

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His
status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins.
Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent
Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary
will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing
defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open
often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit.
Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better
game this season.

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23
carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very
thin at RB..

David Sloan, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you
are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks
from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64
yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs
and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for
the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for
only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good
Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is
also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to
get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless
your team is very thin at wideout.

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is
not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his
third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player
you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year
receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards
and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks,
however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for
the entire preseason. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While
he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for
Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98
yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is
becoming somewhat of a gamble. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has
not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and
four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the
league and is a must-start every week. 

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and
three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every-week starter
in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers
when the matchup is right. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at
Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was
intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play
in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-start
every week.

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay
wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs and two
interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green
Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes a good
backup RB right now.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/18/01
Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the
Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should
not start for most Fantasy teams.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie
is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some
occasional TDs down the stretch. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at
Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup
right now.

Benjamin Gay, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 times
for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and lateral
quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White
shared carries in his place. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith
appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless
you lack depth at RB.

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
The rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets.
Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/18/01
Moss made his pro debut on Sunday, but did not catch a pass and was stopped
for a six-yard loss on his one carry. The rookie has missed too much time
to make a Fantasy impact this season. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Huntley actually had a good outing against San Francisco, posting 94
scrimmage yards and a touchdown. However, he's far too inconsistent to
start on a weekly basis. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
Weinke started Sunday's game against San Francisco after missing last
week's game due to a shoulder injury. He put up decent numbers, throwing
for 177 yards and two touchdowns in Carolina's 25-22 OT loss. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Chrebet did not catch a pass at Miami. The Jets' wideout is no longer
worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Hearst had another strong game, posting 113 scrimmage yards against
Carolina. His comeback from a serious ankle condition is nothing short of
miraculous, and he's actually been a reliable Fantasy player over the last
two weeks. 

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Van Pelt threw for 316 yards, two TDs and no interceptions against the
Seahawks. He did lose a fumble, but Van Pelt got solid protection for most
of the game and will be a respectable Fantasy backup while he fills in for
the injured Rob Johnson.

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/18/01
Garcia had another huge game, posting 305 yards and three touchdowns
against Carolina. He's been one of the top three Fantasy quarterbacks this
season, and may even be more valuable than Peyton Manning at this point. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Price caught 10 passes for 138 yards and a TD against Seattle. He has
clearly become Buffalo's best Fantasy player this season.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Hasselbeck threw for 134 yards, one TD and no interceptions at Buffalo. The
Seattle QB is making less mistakes, yet he doesn't help Fantasy teams much,
either.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/18/01
Kitna put up 234 yards passing and a touchdown against Tennessee, but two
interceptions made his performance mediocre. He's no better than a reserve
Fantasy player at this point, best used when the matchup is right in a
deeper league. 

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Robinson caught two passes for 15 yards at Buffalo, including his first
career TD, a seven-yarder. Robinson is slowly improving, but still does not
produce enough to be a reliable Fantasy player.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Dillon was held in check by Tennessee, rushing for only 38 yards on Sunday.
However, with all the injured running backs around the league this season,
Dillon is still a must-start on a weekly basis. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
McNair played despite a sore thumb, throwing for 172 yards and a touchdown
against Cincinnati. He's been an unreliable Fantasy player this season, and
is worth starting only when the matchup is right. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 11/18/01
George was unimpressive once again, posting only 65 scrimmage yards on
Sunday against Cincinnati. He just doesn't seem to be at full speed this
season, and has been a huge Fantasy disappointment. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Williams had a big game on Sunday, rushing for 120 yards and a touchdown
against Indianapolis. He continues to prove his value as a Fantasy player,
and is a must-start ever week. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/18/01
Brooks had an outstanding game against Indianapolis, throwing for 249 yards
and two touchdowns. He's put together two straight solid games, and may
finally be reaching the potential the coaching staff knew he was capable
of. 

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Manning put up a decent performance against New Orleans, posting 262 yards
and a touchdown. He may not be putting up Manning-like numbers this season,
but he's still far too valuable to ever consider benching. 

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Pollard had a huge game on Sunday, catching three passes for 126 yards and
a touchdown against New Orleans. He may not be the most consistent Fantasy
player, but the lack of tight end depth around the league makes him a
valuable commodity. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 11/18/01
McNabb was unimpressive on Sunday, compiling only 153 scrimmage yards and a
touchdown against Dallas. Despite the mediocre performance, McNabb is still
one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Leaf was horrible for the second straight week, throwing for only 102 yards
with two interceptions. Incidently, both picks were returned for touchdowns
as Dallas fell to Philadelphia, 36-3. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/18/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia in the second half with an
apparent knee injury. He did not return to the game, and finished the day
with 90 scrimmage yards and a fumble. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) did not start in Sunday's game. Jamel White started against
the Ravens. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
McNair will start Sunday's game against Cincinnati as long after taking
pre-game snaps without any problems. McNair, who is dealing with a thumb
injury, isn't worth starting on your Fantasy team outside of deeper
leagues. 

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Green (abdominal strain) is out for Sunday's game. Reidel Anthony will
start in his absence.

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Stewart (ankle) is out for Sunday's game against Arizona. However, coach
Marty Mornhinweg stated that Stewart is making progress, and is getting
closer to returning to action. 

Marco Battaglia, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Battaglia (appendectomy) is out at least a month, and may miss the rest of
the season. The big tight end has no real value as a Fantasy player. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Brunell (quadriceps) will start on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He'll be
facing a tough Steelers' secondary at less than 100 percent, however, so
Fantasy owners may want to consider benching him in Week 10. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Taylor (groin) practiced without incident on Friday, but he still needs
medical clearance before he can play in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.
Even is he is able to play, however, he'd only be used on a limited basis.
Stacey Mack will get the start in any event, so playing Taylor on your
Fantasy team is not a wise move. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/18/01
Pathon (foot) is out for Sunday's game against New Orleans, according to
the <I>Indianapolis Star</I>. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon's place
once again. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) will likely be a gametime decison on Sunday against
Baltimore. If the rookie tailback is unable to play, Jamel White will be
Cleveland's featured back with Benjamin Gay getting some looks in the
backfield as well. 

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/17/01
Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is
one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will
likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.

Jamal Lewis, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01
According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games.
Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be
allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until
Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in
Tennessee. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner
will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in
goal-line situations.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of
Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a
Fantasy perspective.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati
due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills
Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not
being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing
two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said
after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of
the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't
recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now
listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit. However, if
you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week,
Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth
considering as long as he's able to play. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for
Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on
your Fantasy team. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of
consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better
quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in
your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good
to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end
zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the
Giants' secondary on Monday night. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to
an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost
impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy
numbers. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good
player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that
has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347
yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his
potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially
against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11
catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis
squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this
week is a solid option. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's
averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again
emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10
against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three
games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can
be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep
Fantasy leagues. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three
touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this
weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is
worth considering. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three
passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against
Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your
Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a
tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of
deeper leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/16/01
Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored
only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary
this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on
his potential to put up solid numbers. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one
of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the
formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on
his potential for big numbers. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/16/01
Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best
Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post
solid numbers in Week 10 against New England. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is
somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the
league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will
have no choice but to do. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/16/01
Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but
don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting
either back in Week 10 if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis.
He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a
real gamble. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one
of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San
Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/16/01
Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75
yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this
week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this
season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable
secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/16/01
Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in
eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better
option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on
a weekly basis. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected
to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against
Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green
Bay. 

Reuben Droughns, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield
this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy
value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble. 

Lamont Warren, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday
against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth
starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Batch will again lose playing time to Mike McMahon this week. McMahon will
be the No. 2 QB again, but will see playing time as the Lions continue to
use two quarterbacks. As a result, you may want to look for another
signal-caller to start on your Fantasy team. 

David Sloan, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Sloan is an unreliable tight end, which was proven in his one-catch for
minus-2 yard performance in Week Nine. Unless you play in a deeper league,
starting Sloan isn't advisable. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Collins has been inconsistent this season, but the matchup this week
against Minnesota is very favorable. He lit up the Vikings for 381 yards
passing and five touchdowns in last year's NFC Championship game, and is
worth taking a chance on in Week 10. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Jurevicius has put up some solid Fantasy numbers in certain games this
season, but he's been inconsistent overall. However, facing a porous
Minnesota secondary on Monday makes him worth considering in larger Fantasy
leagues. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
Wycheck sat out practice Thursday to rest his injured ankle. He is listed
as questionable for Sunday's game. Don't expect him to be too reliable if
he plays. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hilliard has caught three touchdowns in his last three games, so starting
him against Minnesota is advisable. The Vikings' secondary is questionable
at best, so look for Hilliard to be productive. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Toomer could find some real success on Monday night against Minnesota. The
Vikings sport one of the worst secondaries in the league, so starting
Toomer based on the matchup is a wise move.

Latest NFL Player News

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Hasselbeck is scheduled to start the Seahawks' next game October 28 against
Miami due to a groin injury suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. ""Matt has
had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever
he has to prove,"" Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the <I>Seattle
Post-Intelligencer</I>. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter
right now, especially against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he
is not expected to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to
the <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</I>. ""There's more to it than just a
normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that,"" Seahawks Head Coach Mike
Holmgren said Monday. ""He's injured, and he won't practice this week.""
Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect
him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson
could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the <I>Kansas City Star</I>.
Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/16/01
Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he
sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were
expected back Tuesday.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during
Sunday's game against the Jets, according to the <I>Miami Herald</I>. He
should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/16/01
The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in
San Diego, according to the <I>Denver Post</I>. However, An MRI Monday
morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to
his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's
practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to
get the start.

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville
despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all
year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't
use Johnson.

Jamal Anderson, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left
knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured reserve and is
out for the remainder of the 2001 season. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/16/01
Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets
despite a bruised right knee. ""He really could possibly play this week,""
coach Mike Martz said. ""We're not going to rule the possibility of him
playing completely out."" If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate
will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a
decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the
situation throughout the week. 

Justin McCareins, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle
Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle
Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the
rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards. 

Eddie Berlin, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams, will be sidelined
three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a
kickoff return Sunday.

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Browns' head coach Butch Davis told <i>The Akron Plain-Dealer</i> that
Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens.
Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if
you need an extra wideout this week. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is
recovering from a bruised left shoulder.

Marco Battaglia, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is
suffering from a strained left shoulder. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the
most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will
play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson
in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay
Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw
interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the
fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared himself fit enough to play. ""I'm
still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see
if I was alive,"" he said, ""but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready."" 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during
Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the
injury and is currently listed as day-to-day. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to
Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as
day-to-day. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback
on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to
split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him
Fantasy-wsie. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/16/01
Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis.
The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be
in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be
available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a
decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we
expect him to go. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over
Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble
time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday
night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as
day-to-day. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He
didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy
player at this point. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his
hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday. He is expected to miss six weeks
of action due to the procedure. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He
finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact
Fantasy-wise. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring
any setbacks, Barber will be available for Sunday's game against
Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a
drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was
dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo
tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be
determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would
step into the No. 1 RB role once again. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from
playing at full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever
bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad
idea if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Doug Chapman, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/16/01
Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay
due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for
the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good
numbers against a solid Packers' defense. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
According to the <I>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</I>, Bennett (ankle) is
expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a
protective boot on Monday and was walking with a noticeable limp. Doug
Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's absence. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/16/01
Muhammad suffered a hip injury during Sunday's loss to the New Orleans
Saints. However, the injury won't keep him from playing in this weekend's
game against Washington. Considering the Redskins' woes, it's a good idea
to start Muhammad Fantasy-wise. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Weinke is dealing with a slight thigh injury, but he is expected to play on
Sunday against Washington. With the state of the Redskins team, Weinke may
be worth starting Fantasy-wise. 

Herman Moore, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/15/01
Moore suffered a hip pointed during the second quarter of Sunday's game. It
was his only play of the game, which demonstrates how little his Fantasy
value is these days. He is listed as day-to-day. 

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
The Bears plan to re-sign Matthews possibly on Monday, according to the
<I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>. He would return to his backup QB job, and isn't
worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/15/01
Mike Holmgren has confirmed Trent Dilfer will return to the bench when
Seattle plays its next game. Hasselbeck is expected to start against Miami
on Oct. 28. ""The plan is still to prepare for Miami with Matt as the guy,""
Holmgren said. Neither player has been a very useful Fantasy starter so
far, but Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment, while Dilfer has played
mistake-free football.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/15/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches. He is expected to play in
Week Six.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/15/01
Smith sprained his right ankle on Sunday against the Jets. The injury is
not considered to be serious, and Smith was able to finish the game.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/15/01
Griese re-aggravated a shoulder injury on Sunday at Seattle. The <i>Denver
Post</i> says Griese's shoulder will be re-examined on Monday or Tuesday.
""I was able to come back and play this week, and I'm hoping to do the same
next week,"" Griese said.

Chad Johnson, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Johnson is expected to miss six weeks with a fractured collarbone. He
injured the shoulder in the third quarter of Sunday's game.Ron Dugans might
now become Cincinanti's third receiver. 

Terry Jackson, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Jackson suffered a calf injury Sunday. He is listed as probable for next
week's game at Chicago. 

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says Johnson (neck) looked good in practice on
Sunday. He is expected to play in Week Six. """"He threw the ball extremely
well, especially in the wind today,"" said coach Gregg Williams. ""He had a
fresh arm. It seems like there is no residual effect from it right now."" 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/15/01
A hip injury prevented Muhammad from finishing Sunday's game. He is
expected to play in next week's game against the Redskins. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/15/01
Mathis shook off a hip injury and played in Sunday's game. However, a
sprained hand limited him to four catches for 50 yards. The hand injury
isn't considered to be serious. Mathis will be evaluated on a day-to-day
basis. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Christian suffered bruised ribs in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a
day to day basis. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Jefferson missed a lot of playing time Sunday because of a sprained left
big toe. He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/15/01
The St. Louis Rams will be without Faulk for at least one week. The Rams
originally diagnosed the injury as a sprained right medial collateral
ligament, but an MRI revealed no severe ligament or cartilage damage. Rams
coach Mike Martz fears that Faulk may be sidelined for at least three
weeks. ""They (the doctors) think he will be out somewhere between three to
four weeks,"" Martz said. Faulk will be re-evaluated next week and believes
it is possible he could return for a key NFC West game against the New
Orleans Saints on October 28. ""We'll see,"" Faulk said. ""It's kind of early
to say, but you never know."" 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/15/01
Weinke continued to struggle Sunday, fumbling away the center exchange on
Carolina's second possession, losing another fumble when his arm was hit as
he attempted to pass and also throwing an interception. All three turnovers
led to Saints scores, putting Carolina down 17-0. He finished 21-of-39 for
196 yards and two second-half touchdowns. Use him as a reserve for now. 

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was
replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.

Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect
Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid
outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical
silence,

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33
carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a
Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues
to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even
when Ricky Watters returns.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was
also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and
is no better than a reserve at this point. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and
a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but
he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches
for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting
every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a
roster spot. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two
touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very
useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right. 

Glyn Milburn, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will
be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against
Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider
dropping Bennett altogether. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125
yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at
this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Batch had a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three
scores. He's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the
performance, but he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Franks caught only two passes for four yards against the Ravens, but both
catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as a primary goal-line
threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Patten had a good game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73
yards. He'll likely be pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry
Glenn is back, so don't be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine
numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is
still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this
week.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. The
second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltimore
passing game.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Glenn had a huge game in his return from a suspension, catching seven
passes for 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a
weekly basis, but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with
your receivers. 

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Brookins rushed for 33 yards and a TD against Green Bay. The young, strong
back might continue to emerge in Baltimore's offense as the season wears
on.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Brown had a great outing against San Diego, posting 11 catches for 117
yards against San Diego. With Terry Glenn returning, Brown could become a
pretty relaible Fantasy player facing No. 2 cornerbacks on a weekly basis. 

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the Browns, but he scored
on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scott in the passing game,
even though the final numbers haven't always reflected it.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Conway had a solid game, posting four catches for 117 yards against New
England. He is slowly becoming Doug Flutie's favorite target, and is
becoming a much more reliable Fantasy player than in years past. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win over San Diego, but he did
score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantasy player, however, and
is no better than a reserve used only when the matchup is right. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Johnson caught eight passes for 153 yards and a TD against the Bengals. It
appears the Cleveland wideout is starting to re-emerge as a quality Fantasy
player.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Brady had his first impressive outing on Sunday, throwing for 364 yards and
two touchdowns in the Patriots' 29-26 overtime win over San Diego. Despite
the great performace, Brady is still not worth anything more than a reserve
spot Fantasy-wise. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Jackson played against Cincinnati, but was limited to only 22 rushing yards
on 14 carries. The rookie running back, who played despite some rib
problems, has been inconsistent and unreliable so far.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Tomlinson's yardage numbers (87 total) were subpar by his standards, but he
did score another touchdown for San Diego. He's one of the top tailbacks in
the league and should be a weekly starter Fantasy-wise. 

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Flutie had a solid game on Sunday, posting 270 yards passing and a
touchdown against New England. He's still not worth starting every week,
but is better of used when the matchup is right. 

Justin McCareins, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
McCareins started in place of the injured Derrick Mason on Sunday against
Tampa Bay. He did have two catches for 70 yards in the game, but still
warrants very little Fantasy consideration. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Hayes caught seven passes for 44 yards against the Saints. If opponents
continue to pay extra attention to Muhsin Muhammad, Hayes might continue to
post some respectable numbers.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
George had his best Fantasy game of the season, posting 132 yards of total
offense and a score against Tampa Bay. The performance brings a sigh of
relief from Fantasy owners worried that George had lost a step after
offseason toe surgery. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Huntley rushed for only two yards on four carries against New Orleans. The
Panthers are still searching for a quality runner, but Huntley doesn't
appear capable of filling their void at RB.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
McNair finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, compiling 284 yards of
total offense and two touchdowns against Tampa Bay. He's still not a
reliable weekly option Fantasy-wise, so use him only if the matchup is
right. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Muhammad caught only two passes for eight yards against he Saints. Don't
expect such poor numbers from Muhammad very often. He remains a quality
Fantasy wideout.

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Green was solid on Sunday, catching six passes for 72 yards and a score
against Tennessee. Despite his good performance, Green is still not a
reliable player from a Fantasy perspective. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Cleeland overcame a hamstring problem to play against Carolina, and he
caught two TD passes. The injury-prone tight end finished with three
catches for 38 yards, but he remains a Fantasy risk because he simply can't
seem to stay healthy for very long.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Johnson had his best game of the season, posting eight catches for 140
yards against Tennessee. He's a top-notch wideout Fantasy-wise, and
deserves a weekly spot in your starting lineup. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Smith rushed for 50 yards and a TD against the 49ers. Smith's yardage
numbers won't be overwhelming the rest of the year, but he should continue
to be a consistent TD threat.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Dunn (foot) was used as the Bucs' featured back on Sunday against
Tennessee. He posted 81 yards of total offense and two scores in Tampa
Bay's 31-28 overtime win. 

Tai Streets, WR SF - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Streets caught four passes for 51 yards against Atlanta. With J.J. Stokes
continuing to wallow in mediocrity, Streets has a chance to step up and
take a more prominent role in the San Francisco offense.

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Johnson finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, throwing for 287 yards
and three scores against Tennessee. He is still not worth starting on a
regular basis, however, and is better off used when the matchup is good. 

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Robinson struggled on Sunday, catching only two passes for six yards. He
had been dealing with a sore lower back, which may have had something to do
with his performance in the game. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Thomas had 11 carries for 58 yards in Sunday's game against Arizona. Thomas
is inching closer to taking James Allen's starting job, and is worth
stashing away on your roster if available. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183
yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime.
Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best
receivers.

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Allen had a solid game on Sunday, rushing for 75 yards and a touchdown.
However, the performance is a bit tainted Fantasy-wise since it was against
a weak Arizona defensive front. Don't expect thos type of numbers from the
Bears' tailback on a weekly basis. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Surprisingly, Miller had a tough day against a shaky Arizona defense on
Sunday. The Bears' QB threw for only 116 yards and was picked off twice in
Chicago's 21-13 victory. Miller is still worth a roster spot, but he's no
better than a backup Fantasy-wise.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Canidate replaced the injured Marshall Faulk late in Sunday's game against
the N.Y. Giants. If Faulk's knee injury is serious, be sure to put in a
waivers request for Canidate as soon as possible. 

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Minnis caught one pass for only 14 yards against the Steelers. The rookie
has been inconsistent so far, and is a risky start unless he faces a
below-average defense.

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Hilliard, who was dealing with a slight oblique strain, played on Sunday
against St. Louis. He caught three passes for 49 yards and a score in New
York's 15-14 loss. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Alexander overcame back problems to play against the Steelers, but was held
to just one catch for 10 yards. Injuries and lack of effective complements
have rendered Alexander a disappointment so far this season.

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Jurevicius posted a solid game against St. Louis, catching six passes for
101 yards. If he continues to put up good numbers, Jurevicius could keep
Ike Hilliard from getting back his starting role. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Holmes rushed for 150 yards and two TDs against Pittsburgh. Such good
numbers against the Steelers prove Holmes has arrived as a quality Fantasy
player.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Dayne started on Sunday against St. Louis despite a neck injury. He rushed
for 88 yards and a score in New York's 15-14 loss, and may be solidifying
his grasp on the featured back role for the G-Men. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Collins completed 18-of-32 passes for 250 yards and a touchdown on Sunday
against St. Louis. However, he's still not a reliable starter Fantasy-wise
despite his decent numbers against the Rams. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Ward had another solid outing. While he caught four passes for only 38
yards, he did catch a five-yard TD pass, once again proving he is the only
reliable wideout on the Pittsburgh roster,

Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson!  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=12342&>, WR TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football215.fan! ta! sy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=12753&>, RB! J! AC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football215! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1035&>, QB BAL - H! ou! ston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=12411&>, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&! ke! y=187503&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1292&>, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was! a! ble to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and could be back in the Giants' starting lineup within the next few weeks. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10! /! 23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free ! Ag! ent Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable. 

Dez White <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in place of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper leagues. 

David Terrell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/23/01
Terrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's third receiver. 

Tony Martin <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then. 

Rob Moore <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular se! as! on game this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. 

Tiki Barber <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Richard Huntley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&leagu! e=! getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.

Jacquez Green <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=12405&>, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in! W! eek Seven.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1265&>, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Warrick Dunn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bucs Head Coac! h ! Tony Dungy told the St. Petersburg Times . ""Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.

Brett Favre <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=1958&key=1028&>, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK,"" Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that will help.""

Latest NFL Player News

Justin McCareins, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle
Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle
Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the
rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards. 

Eddie Berlin, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams, will be sidelined
three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a
kickoff return Sunday.

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Browns' head coach Butch Davis told <i>The Akron Plain-Dealer</i> that
Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens.
Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if
you need an extra wideout this week. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is
recovering from a bruised left shoulder.

Marco Battaglia, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is
suffering from a strained left shoulder. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the
most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will
play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson
in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay
Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw
interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the
fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared himself fit enough to play. ""I'm
still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see
if I was alive,"" he said, ""but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready."" 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during
Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the
injury and is currently listed as day-to-day. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to
Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as
day-to-day. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback
on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to
split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him
Fantasy-wsie. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/16/01
Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis.
The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be
in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be
available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a
decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we
expect him to go. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over
Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble
time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday
night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as
day-to-day. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He
didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy
player at this point. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his
hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday. He is expected to miss six weeks
of action due to the procedure. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He
finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact
Fantasy-wise. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring
any setbacks, Barber will be available for Sunday's game against
Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a
drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was
dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo
tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be
determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would
step into the No. 1 RB role once again. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from
playing at full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever
bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad
idea if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Doug Chapman, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/16/01
Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay
due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for
the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good
numbers against a solid Packers' defense. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
According to the <I>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</I>, Bennett (ankle) is
expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a
protective boot on Monday and was walking with a noticeable limp. Doug
Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's absence. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/16/01
Muhammad suffered a hip injury during Sunday's loss to the New Orleans
Saints. However, the injury won't keep him from playing in this weekend's
game against Washington. Considering the Redskins' woes, it's a good idea
to start Muhammad Fantasy-wise. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Weinke is dealing with a slight thigh injury, but he is expected to play on
Sunday against Washington. With the state of the Redskins team, Weinke may
be worth starting Fantasy-wise. 

Herman Moore, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/15/01
Moore suffered a hip pointed during the second quarter of Sunday's game. It
was his only play of the game, which demonstrates how little his Fantasy
value is these days. He is listed as day-to-day. 

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
The Bears plan to re-sign Matthews possibly on Monday, according to the
<I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>. He would return to his backup QB job, and isn't
worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/15/01
Mike Holmgren has confirmed Trent Dilfer will return to the bench when
Seattle plays its next game. Hasselbeck is expected to start against Miami
on Oct. 28. ""The plan is still to prepare for Miami with Matt as the guy,""
Holmgren said. Neither player has been a very useful Fantasy starter so
far, but Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment, while Dilfer has played
mistake-free football.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/15/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches. He is expected to play in
Week Six.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/15/01
Smith sprained his right ankle on Sunday against the Jets. The injury is
not considered to be serious, and Smith was able to finish the game.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/15/01
Griese re-aggravated a shoulder injury on Sunday at Seattle. The <i>Denver
Post</i> says Griese's shoulder will be re-examined on Monday or Tuesday.
""I was able to come back and play this week, and I'm hoping to do the same
next week,"" Griese said.

Chad Johnson, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Johnson is expected to miss six weeks with a fractured collarbone. He
injured the shoulder in the third quarter of Sunday's game.Ron Dugans might
now become Cincinanti's third receiver. 

Terry Jackson, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Jackson suffered a calf injury Sunday. He is listed as probable for next
week's game at Chicago. 

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says Johnson (neck) looked good in practice on
Sunday. He is expected to play in Week Six. """"He threw the ball extremely
well, especially in the wind today,"" said coach Gregg Williams. ""He had a
fresh arm. It seems like there is no residual effect from it right now."" 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/15/01
A hip injury prevented Muhammad from finishing Sunday's game. He is
expected to play in next week's game against the Redskins. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/15/01
Mathis shook off a hip injury and played in Sunday's game. However, a
sprained hand limited him to four catches for 50 yards. The hand injury
isn't considered to be serious. Mathis will be evaluated on a day-to-day
basis. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Christian suffered bruised ribs in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a
day to day basis. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Jefferson missed a lot of playing time Sunday because of a sprained left
big toe. He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/15/01
The St. Louis Rams will be without Faulk for at least one week. The Rams
originally diagnosed the injury as a sprained right medial collateral
ligament, but an MRI revealed no severe ligament or cartilage damage. Rams
coach Mike Martz fears that Faulk may be sidelined for at least three
weeks. ""They (the doctors) think he will be out somewhere between three to
four weeks,"" Martz said. Faulk will be re-evaluated next week and believes
it is possible he could return for a key NFC West game against the New
Orleans Saints on October 28. ""We'll see,"" Faulk said. ""It's kind of early
to say, but you never know."" 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/15/01
Weinke continued to struggle Sunday, fumbling away the center exchange on
Carolina's second possession, losing another fumble when his arm was hit as
he attempted to pass and also throwing an interception. All three turnovers
led to Saints scores, putting Carolina down 17-0. He finished 21-of-39 for
196 yards and two second-half touchdowns. Use him as a reserve for now. 

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was
replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.

Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect
Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid
outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical
silence,

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33
carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a
Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues
to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even
when Ricky Watters returns.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was
also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and
is no better than a reserve at this point. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and
a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but
he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches
for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting
every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a
roster spot. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two
touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very
useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right. 

Glyn Milburn, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will
be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against
Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider
dropping Bennett altogether. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125
yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at
this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Batch had a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three
scores. He's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the
performance, but he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Franks caught only two passes for four yards against the Ravens, but both
catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as a primary goal-line
threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Patten had a good game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73
yards. He'll likely be pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry
Glenn is back, so don't be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine
numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is
still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this
week.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. The
second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltimore
passing game.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Glenn had a huge game in his return from a suspension, catching seven
passes for 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a
weekly basis, but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with
your receivers. 

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Brookins rushed for 33 yards and a TD against Green Bay. The young, strong
back might continue to emerge in Baltimore's offense as the season wears
on.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Brown had a great outing against San Diego, posting 11 catches for 117
yards against San Diego. With Terry Glenn returning, Brown could become a
pretty relaible Fantasy player facing No. 2 cornerbacks on a weekly basis. 

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the Browns, but he scored
on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scott in the passing game,
even though the final numbers haven't always reflected it.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Conway had a solid game, posting four catches for 117 yards against New
England. He is slowly becoming Doug Flutie's favorite target, and is
becoming a much more reliable Fantasy player than in years past. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win over San Diego, but he did
score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantasy player, however, and
is no better than a reserve used only when the matchup is right. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Johnson caught eight passes for 153 yards and a TD against the Bengals. It
appears the Cleveland wideout is starting to re-emerge as a quality Fantasy
player.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Brady had his first impressive outing on Sunday, throwing for 364 yards and
two touchdowns in the Patriots' 29-26 overtime win over San Diego. Despite
the great performace, Brady is still not worth anything more than a reserve
spot Fantasy-wise. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Jackson played against Cincinnati, but was limited to only 22 rushing yards
on 14 carries. The rookie running back, who played despite some rib
problems, has been inconsistent and unreliable so far.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Tomlinson's yardage numbers (87 total) were subpar by his standards, but he
did score another touchdown for San Diego. He's one of the top tailbacks in
the league and should be a weekly starter Fantasy-wise. 

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Flutie had a solid game on Sunday, posting 270 yards passing and a
touchdown against New England. He's still not worth starting every week,
but is better of used when the matchup is right. 

Justin McCareins, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
McCareins started in place of the injured Derrick Mason on Sunday against
Tampa Bay. He did have two catches for 70 yards in the game, but still
warrants very little Fantasy consideration. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Hayes caught seven passes for 44 yards against the Saints. If opponents
continue to pay extra attention to Muhsin Muhammad, Hayes might continue to
post some respectable numbers.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
George had his best Fantasy game of the season, posting 132 yards of total
offense and a score against Tampa Bay. The performance brings a sigh of
relief from Fantasy owners worried that George had lost a step after
offseason toe surgery. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Huntley rushed for only two yards on four carries against New Orleans. The
Panthers are still searching for a quality runner, but Huntley doesn't
appear capable of filling their void at RB.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
McNair finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, compiling 284 yards of
total offense and two touchdowns against Tampa Bay. He's still not a
reliable weekly option Fantasy-wise, so use him only if the matchup is
right. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Muhammad caught only two passes for eight yards against he Saints. Don't
expect such poor numbers from Muhammad very often. He remains a quality
Fantasy wideout.

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Green was solid on Sunday, catching six passes for 72 yards and a score
against Tennessee. Despite his good performance, Green is still not a
reliable player from a Fantasy perspective. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Cleeland overcame a hamstring problem to play against Carolina, and he
caught two TD passes. The injury-prone tight end finished with three
catches for 38 yards, but he remains a Fantasy risk because he simply can't
seem to stay healthy for very long.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Johnson had his best game of the season, posting eight catches for 140
yards against Tennessee. He's a top-notch wideout Fantasy-wise, and
deserves a weekly spot in your starting lineup. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Smith rushed for 50 yards and a TD against the 49ers. Smith's yardage
numbers won't be overwhelming the rest of the year, but he should continue
to be a consistent TD threat.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Dunn (foot) was used as the Bucs' featured back on Sunday against
Tennessee. He posted 81 yards of total offense and two scores in Tampa
Bay's 31-28 overtime win. 

Tai Streets, WR SF - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Streets caught four passes for 51 yards against Atlanta. With J.J. Stokes
continuing to wallow in mediocrity, Streets has a chance to step up and
take a more prominent role in the San Francisco offense.

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Johnson finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, throwing for 287 yards
and three scores against Tennessee. He is still not worth starting on a
regular basis, however, and is better off used when the matchup is good. 

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Robinson struggled on Sunday, catching only two passes for six yards. He
had been dealing with a sore lower back, which may have had something to do
with his performance in the game. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Thomas had 11 carries for 58 yards in Sunday's game against Arizona. Thomas
is inching closer to taking James Allen's starting job, and is worth
stashing away on your roster if available. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183
yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime.
Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best
receivers.

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Allen had a solid game on Sunday, rushing for 75 yards and a touchdown.
However, the performance is a bit tainted Fantasy-wise since it was against
a weak Arizona defensive front. Don't expect thos type of numbers from the
Bears' tailback on a weekly basis. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Surprisingly, Miller had a tough day against a shaky Arizona defense on
Sunday. The Bears' QB threw for only 116 yards and was picked off twice in
Chicago's 21-13 victory. Miller is still worth a roster spot, but he's no
better than a backup Fantasy-wise.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Canidate replaced the injured Marshall Faulk late in Sunday's game against
the N.Y. Giants. If Faulk's knee injury is serious, be sure to put in a
waivers request for Canidate as soon as possible. 

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Minnis caught one pass for only 14 yards against the Steelers. The rookie
has been inconsistent so far, and is a risky start unless he faces a
below-average defense.

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Hilliard, who was dealing with a slight oblique strain, played on Sunday
against St. Louis. He caught three passes for 49 yards and a score in New
York's 15-14 loss. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Alexander overcame back problems to play against the Steelers, but was held
to just one catch for 10 yards. Injuries and lack of effective complements
have rendered Alexander a disappointment so far this season.

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Jurevicius posted a solid game against St. Louis, catching six passes for
101 yards. If he continues to put up good numbers, Jurevicius could keep
Ike Hilliard from getting back his starting role. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Holmes rushed for 150 yards and two TDs against Pittsburgh. Such good
numbers against the Steelers prove Holmes has arrived as a quality Fantasy
player.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Dayne started on Sunday against St. Louis despite a neck injury. He rushed
for 88 yards and a score in New York's 15-14 loss, and may be solidifying
his grasp on the featured back role for the G-Men. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Collins completed 18-of-32 passes for 250 yards and a touchdown on Sunday
against St. Louis. However, he's still not a reliable starter Fantasy-wise
despite his decent numbers against the Rams. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Ward had another solid outing. While he caught four passes for only 38
yards, he did catch a five-yard TD pass, once again proving he is the only
reliable wideout on the Pittsburgh roster,

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Warner left Sunday's game against the N.Y. Giants in the fourth quarter
after having the wind knocked out of him. However, he returned to action
after being sidelined for only one play. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Grbac suffered a sprained neck in the first half of Sunday's game at Green
Bay, but stayed in the game until the fourth quarter. He was finally
replaced by Randall Cunningham when Green Bay took a 31-10 lead.

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Faulk left Sunday's game against the N.Y. Giants in the second half with a
sprained MCL in his right knee. Trung Canidate replaced Faulk, who did not
return to the game. Faulk is expected to miss up to four weeks due to the
injury, so it might be a good idea for Fantasy owners to pick up Trung
Canidate immediately. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Schroeder suffered an ankle injury just before halftime of Sunday's game.
He did not return for the second half, although he was available and ready
to play if needed.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
McNair left Sunday's game against Tampa Bay in the second quarter due to a
twisted ankle. However, he did return to the game at the start of the
second half. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Jeffers was declared inactive for the game against New Orleans. He is
getting close to playing form, though, and might return to action in the
near future.

Nick Goings, RB CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Goings was declared inactive for the game against New Orleans. Tim
Biakabutuka and Richard Huntley are getting carries at halfback.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Dunn is getting the majority of the work in Tampa Bay's backfield against
Tennessee. He had been nursing a foot injury, but seems to be close to 100
percent. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Pittman left Sunday's game against Chicago in the first quarter due to an
undisclosed leg injury. However, Pittman did return to the game in the
second quarter.

The jury is still out!  LoreLei Reid's pick isn't on the spreadsheet that
Bob sent to me.  Everyone else is out.  LoreLei may have left a voice
message with Bob, or sent him an e-mail on Friday? I haven't spoken to Bob
yet today.  If she's not out.....she wins $740.    If she didn't
survive.....a decision needs to be made on what to do about the pool.

Options:
1.  Divide $740 among 13 people. ($56.92).  Game over!
2.  Let anyone who wants to collect their $57 do so.....then continue on
with the game with the ones who want to stay!   
 
Do you have LoreLei's phone number?

Thanks.  That Kennedy Oil deal still needs to be in Sitara b/c it is causing an imbalance in my positions.  If the deal is in Tagg, it needs to be in Sitara. Does that make sense?  Let me know.

Crude Oil Futures Rise Ahead of Extended Holiday Weekend

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.34 
to $19.62 per barrel on Friday as the market traded on short-term 
technicals. Traders were squaring their books before the long 
Christmas hokiday. Expectations that OPEC would finally move ahead 
with a plan to remove 2 million bpd from the world market likely gave 
the pre-holiday market a boost. The cartel has agreed to chop 1.5 
million bpd from production if non-OPEC producers remove an 
additional 500,000 bpd between them. Last week, Omans raised its 
pledge to trim output from 25,000 to 40,000 bpd, which leaves the 
cartel only 37,500 bpd short of its goal. OPEC ministers plan to meet 
in Cairo on December 28th to weigh their options, but insiders say 
the cartel will move ahead with their plans, despite the relatively 
small shortfall. Petroleum inventories are 50 million barrels higher 
than a year ago, after a slumping economy whittled away at demand. 
But gasoline and heating oil stockpiles unexpectedly fell for the 
week ended December 14th and crude inventories rose less than 
predicted. The EIA said that the national average retail price for 
gasoline has fallen $0.036 to $1.06 per gallon, down $0.36 from a 
year ago. Gasoline futures for January delivery on the NYMEX climbed 
$0.0083 to $0.5586 per gallon. January heating oil futures on the 
NYMEX rose $0.0035 to $0.5484 per gallon after forecasts that 
temperatures in the Northeast would be near or below normal over the 
Christmas season. In London, Brent crude oil futures for February 
delivery on the IPE were up $0.23 to $19.36 per barrel.

Bad Weather in Russia Lowers Oil Exports

 
    Russia is set to announce crude exports in the 4th quarter were 
almost 150,000 bpd below what was planned due to bad weather. The 
fall, equal to what OPEC asked Russia to cut in exports in the 1st 
quarter of 2002, would be down from an initial 4th quarter schedule 
of 2.88 million bpd for Russian and transit oil. The 4th quarter 
figures will be released in early January. Predictions are that 
Russia will be short by 145,000  160,000 bpd if the weather does not 
take a turn for the worse. Third quarter exports came in around 3 
million bpd. Russia committed to trim exports by 150,000 bpd as part 
of OPEC's plan to have non-members contribute 500,000 bpd in export 
reductions before the cartel would lower its production by 1.5 
million bpd. Removal of the oil from the global market is aimed at 
lifting prices which have tumbled as an economic downturn has eaten 
away at demand. But, Russian oil exports were already hard hit by 
inclement weather in November when the key ports of Novorossiisk and 
Tuapse in Russia, Odessa in Ukraine and Ventspils in Latvia were 
closed for a total of 25 days. In December, Novorossiisk was shut-
down for over 10 days, while Lithuanian terminal Butinge was closed 
the entire month because of an oil leak. Russian crude output and 
export schedules are established every quarter and spread among the 
country's oil firms. OPEC has asked Russia to explain the statistics 
of its promised 1st quarter cut before the cartel meets on December 
28 in Cairo to set its own final reduction. Those close to the 
situation have reported that Russia will set exports at 2.6 million 
bpd, or about 144,000 bpd lower than the 4th quarter. Lukoil said 
that Russia needed to reduce output to prevent an already overloaded 
pipeline system from breaking down.

Saudi Arabia and Oil Majors Negotiating Natural Gas Agreements

    Saudi Arabia and 8 international oil companies, which are 
negotiating large natural gas investments in the country, have said 
that they expect to sign executive agreements by next March. The 
agreements center around 3 multi-billion dollar projects in the Saudi 
natural gas sector. ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell will take the 
lead in the kingdom's natural gas initiative. ExxonMobil has the lead 
role in the $15 billion South Ghawar development, core venture one, 
which includes Royal Dutch/Shell, BP and Phillips. ExxonMovil will 
also lead the $5 billion Red Sea development, core venture 2, which 
includes Occidental and Marathon. Royal Dutch/Shell has the leading 
role in the $5 billion Shaybah development, core venture three, with 
Conoco and TotalFinaElf. The natural gas initiative is expected to 
boost the Saudi economy and create jobs. The kingdom's natural gas 
upstream has been off-limits to foreign companies for the past 25 
years.

EIA 2002 Energy Outlook 

    Average world oil prices will gradually move higher from 2002 
through the year 2020 as demand rises by 56%, according to the EIA in 
its Annual Energy Outlook 2002 report, but natural gas and 
electricity prices will likely fall. The EIA expects world oil demand 
to rise to 118.9 million bpd in 2020. World demand stood at 76 
million bpd seen in 2000. World oil prices will also average $22.48 a 
barrel in 2001, down from $27.72 in 2000, before starting a gradual 
increase after 2002, the report predicted. The price in 2020 will 
reach $24.68 per barrel, largely due to higher projected world 
demand. The EIA also forecasted that OPEC oil production will reach 
57.5 million bpd in 2020, almost twice the 30.9 million bpd produced 
last year. Average wellhead prices for natural gas will likely be at 
$4 per Mcf in 2001, up from $3.60 in 2000, but then decline sharply 
by 2020, the EIA report said. It predicted a price of $3.26 per Mcf 
for 2020, even though demand that year will likely be 1 Tcf lower 
than was projected in 2001, because of a less optimistic assessment 
of natural gas reserves discovered by exploratory drilling. 
Electricity prices are also predicted to decline to $0.065 per kWh in 
2020, down from $0.069 in 2000. But the new 2020 price level is 
higher than the $0.061 projected last year because of higher than 
previously expected electricity demand. The accuracy of 20-year 
forecast is not only severely limited but also does not account for 
the volatility during the period. To see the full report, please go

Shell and Gazprom in Russian Arctic Natural Gas Deal 

    Russia's Gazprom is set to conclude a joint venture agreement 
with Shell that will allow Shell to invest in a huge Arctic natural 
gas field operated by Gazprom. The deal is supported by both Vladimir 
Putin and Tony Blair. Gazprom brought the field onstream last October 
in the polar region of Yamal-Nenets. The field, Zapolyarnoye, is the 
world's 5th largest natural gas field. It holds 3 trillion cubic 
meters and a life of at least 42 years.

Antitrust Lawsuit Reinstated Against Major Oil Companies
  
    An appeals court has strengthened the claims of a 1997 lawsuit 
that alleges oil and petrochemical companies used shared salary 
information to unlawfully keep workers' pay at artificially low 
levels. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals tossed out a lower court 
ruling dismissing the lawsuit, brought against 14 major companies 
that employ about 80% - 90% percent of the industry's work force. The 
defendants previously denied the allegations. The case was sent back 
to the lower court for further proceedings. The lawsuit was brought 
by a former Exxon worker on behalf of herself and other Exxon 
employees alleging the companies violated federal antitrust law by 
regularly sharing detailed information about compensation paid to 
nonunion managerial, professional and technical employees agreeing 
that they would use the data to set salaries. In addition to Exxon, 
the other defendants include: Mobil, Texaco and Chevron.

Latest NFL Player News

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/17/01
Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is
one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will
likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.

Jamal Lewis, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01
According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games.
Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be
allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until
Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in
Tennessee. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner
will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in
goal-line situations.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of
Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a
Fantasy perspective.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati
due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills
Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not
being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing
two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said
after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of
the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't
recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now
listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit. However, if
you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week,
Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth
considering as long as he's able to play. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for
Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on
your Fantasy team. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of
consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better
quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in
your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good
to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end
zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the
Giants' secondary on Monday night. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to
an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost
impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy
numbers. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good
player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that
has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347
yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his
potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially
against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11
catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis
squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this
week is a solid option. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's
averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again
emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10
against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three
games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can
be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep
Fantasy leagues. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three
touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this
weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is
worth considering. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three
passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against
Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your
Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a
tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of
deeper leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/16/01
Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored
only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary
this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on
his potential to put up solid numbers. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one
of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the
formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on
his potential for big numbers. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/16/01
Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best
Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post
solid numbers in Week 10 against New England. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is
somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the
league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will
have no choice but to do. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/16/01
Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but
don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting
either back in Week 10 if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis.
He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a
real gamble. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one
of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San
Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/16/01
Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75
yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this
week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this
season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable
secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/16/01
Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in
eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better
option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on
a weekly basis. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected
to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against
Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green
Bay. 

Reuben Droughns, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield
this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy
value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble. 

Lamont Warren, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday
against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth
starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Batch will again lose playing time to Mike McMahon this week. McMahon will
be the No. 2 QB again, but will see playing time as the Lions continue to
use two quarterbacks. As a result, you may want to look for another
signal-caller to start on your Fantasy team. 

David Sloan, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Sloan is an unreliable tight end, which was proven in his one-catch for
minus-2 yard performance in Week Nine. Unless you play in a deeper league,
starting Sloan isn't advisable. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Collins has been inconsistent this season, but the matchup this week
against Minnesota is very favorable. He lit up the Vikings for 381 yards
passing and five touchdowns in last year's NFC Championship game, and is
worth taking a chance on in Week 10. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Jurevicius has put up some solid Fantasy numbers in certain games this
season, but he's been inconsistent overall. However, facing a porous
Minnesota secondary on Monday makes him worth considering in larger Fantasy
leagues. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
Wycheck sat out practice Thursday to rest his injured ankle. He is listed
as questionable for Sunday's game. Don't expect him to be too reliable if
he plays. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hilliard has caught three touchdowns in his last three games, so starting
him against Minnesota is advisable. The Vikings' secondary is questionable
at best, so look for Hilliard to be productive. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Toomer could find some real success on Monday night against Minnesota. The
Vikings sport one of the worst secondaries in the league, so starting
Toomer based on the matchup is a wise move. 

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/16/01
Contrary to some earlier reports, Anderson will remain the starter in
Denver's backfield for now. Some reports had indicated that Olandis Gary
would start in his place.

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Bennett is expected to return to action after missing three game with a
high ankle sprain. He'll likely split carries with Doug Chapman on Monday
night against the Giants, making him a risky start on your Fantasy team. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Pathon (foot) is now listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Rookie Reggie
Wayne should start in his place.

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Alexander (ankle) did not practice on Friday, and is out for Sunday's game
against Denver. William Rasby and Zeron Flemister will likely split time at
tight end in Alexander's absence, but neither player has any real Fantasy
value.

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Linebacker Lavar Arrington (ankle) is expected to play on Sunday against
Denver. ""We wouldn't play him if we thought he wouldn't be effective,""
Redskins Coach Marty Schottenheimer told the <I>Washington Post</I>. ""I
think he'll be effective."" He suffered the injury in a game against Seattle
a few weeks ago. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Wheatley has strep throat, and missed practice on Thursday. He is now
questionable for Sunday's game as he also makes his way back from a knee
injury.

 Eagles, DT PHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Cornerback Bobby Taylor missed practice on Wednesday with a quadriceps
injury. He is expected to return to practice, however, and should be ready
in time for Sunday's game against Dallas. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Kinney missed practice Thursday and is not expected to play. He has been
hindered by a calf injury for over a month.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/16/01
Smith (ankle) has missed two consecutive days of practice. He is still
expected to play against the Chargers.

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Ward has clearly become a fine receiver, however, he doesn't catch TD
passes very often. He is nothing more than a Fantasy reserve right now. 

Tyrone Davis, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
According to the <I>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</I>, Davis' hamstring has
healed to the point where he is almost ready to return to action. ""This
week I really let it go,"" Davis said. ""I opened it up. I think I'm ready
right now. It's not easy to get back into football shape, but it's coming.
If called upon, I could play."" Davis could return as early as Thanksgiving,
when Green Bay faces the Detroit Lions at the Silverdome. With Bubba Franks
playing well, however, Davis likely won't make a huge Fantasy impact. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 11/16/01
Bettis has overcome a wrist injury in recent weeks and remains a top-notch
Fantasy RB. Look for him to play well against Jacksonville this week. 

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Zereoue practiced Thursday and is expected to play Thursday. He has been
sidelined for over a month because of a shoulder injury. Zereoue should get
some carries this week and will be used periodically to spell Jerome
Bettis. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Brady has been ineffective all season. Don't expect him to be too
productive against Pittsburgh. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Smith has been consistent all season. He is one of the top receivers in
Fantasy Football and worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
According to <I>footballinjuries.com</I>, Weinke practiced on Thursday
without incident, but he's still hasn't been named the starter for Sunday's
game against San Francisco. ""To be quite frank with you, I don't know if
Chris will start,"" said coach George Seifert. ""I would not stand here right
now and say that is what is going to happen. Quite seriously, I am not
playing any coaching games. I just don't know if it's the best thing right
now or if he's totally ready. I haven't come to a conclusion yet watching
practice."" Matt Lytle will likely start his second straight game if Weinke
is unable to play. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Taylor remains questionable for Sunday's game. He will likely be used on a
limited basis if he does play. Taylor has been sidelined for over a month
with a groin injury. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Hambrick practiced on Thursday, but his shoulder is still a bit sore. He'll
start at tailback if Emmitt Smith is unable to play Sunday, but he would
not play fullback if Smith starts. Hambrick's shoulder is too sore to block
effectively, so unless he is Dallas' featured back, he's not worth starting
on your Fantasy team this week. 

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Joseph will get some carries this week in the absence of Fred Taylor, but
will be used primarily on third-down situations. Don't expect him to be
productive. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Smith (knee) returned to practice on Thursday, and felt pretty good after
the workout. According to <I>footballinjuries.com</I>, if Smith practices
without incident on Friday, he'll have an excellent chance at starting in
Sunday's game against Philadelphia. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Couch has been consistent all season despite a lack of overall talent at
wideout. Look for him to be a productive starter once again this week. 

Mike McMahon, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, the Lions will continue to give McMahon
some snaps during upcoming games. He is not expected to play full-time, but
this development means that Charlie Batch will lose some playing time, and
could be an endorsement for McMahon in the future. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Jackson is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Baltimore
because of a sore ankle. Don't expect him to be too productive if he does
play. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Dillon has been a consistent runner all season and remains worthy of No. 1
RB status on many Fantasy teams. Even if opponents limit his yardage
numbers at times, it is difficult to stifle him completely. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/16/01
Kitna should be a solid Fantasy QB. Expect him to throw for at least 200
yards and a touchdown.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Warrick will catch some passes but don't expect him to score. He has one TD
reception this season. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/16/01
Look for Sharpe to catch a few passes this week and accumulate an adequate
amount of receiving yards. He has been one of best tight ends this season. 

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
Taylor has been a disappointment this season catching just two TD passes.
Don't expect him to be productive this week. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/16/01
Ismail had 85 receiving yards and a TD reception in the first game against
Cleveland this year. Expect him to play well once again this week. Ismail
has been productive all season. 

Obafemi Ayanbadejo, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Ayanbadejo will get carries in short yardage and goal-line situations.
However, he won't gain enough yards to be a productive Fantasy starter. 

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Brookins will get a lot of carries this week in the absence of Terry Allen.
However, FB Obafemi Ayanbadejo will probably be used more in goal-line
situations. Nevertheless, Brookins should be an adequate No. 2 back. 

Moe Williams, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Williams will get some playing time Sunday in the absence of Terry allen,
but will likely be used on third down situations. ""Femi [Obafemi
Ayanbadejo] and Brook [Jason Brookins] are going to carry most of it,""
Williams told <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>. ""I'll just try and get in when I
can."" 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
McNair watched practice Thursday with ice wrapped around his sore and
swollen thumb. McNair injured the thumb on his throwing hand during the
first half of Monday night's 16-10 loss to Baltimore. He couldn't grip a
ball Wednesday and didn't throw one Thursday. The Titans play at Cincinnati
on Sunday. ""There's a chance he may throw the ball a little bit tomorrow
[Friday],"" coach Jeff Fisher said. A splint that had been on his hand
Wednesday was gone, replaced by tape on the thumb and index finger.
Swelling around the base of the thumb is the biggest problem. McNair is
still listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He probably won't be able
to throw the ball too well if he does play. Consider starting another QB. 

Michael Vick, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Vick will return to his backup role this weekend against Green Bay. He may
see some playing time in certain situations, but he's not worth starting on
your Fantasy team. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Mathis has done nothing this season in Atlanta, making him virtaully
worthless to Fantasy owners. If you've still got him in a deeper league,
continue to sit Mathis until he shows he's worth a starting nod. 

Reggie Kelly, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Kelly is doubtful for Sunday'a game against Green Bay due to a knee injury.
He'll be replaced by Alge Crumpler, who may take over the starting job from
Kelly from this point on. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player this season, and things won't
change this weekend against Green Bay. The Packers sport a very tough pass
defense, so starting Martin isn't advisable. 

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/15/01
According to published reports, Gary may get consideration for a starting
spot this week. The Broncos have apparently lost some faith in Mike
Anderson. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/15/01
According to published reports, Smith returned to practice on Thursday.
There is still no offical word on hsi status for Sunday's game.

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/15/01
Stewart (ankle) did not practice again on Thursday. He is expected to miss
Sunday's game against the Cardinals, so be sure to reserve him again this
week. 

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/15/01
According to published reports, it has been confirmed that James will miss
the rest of the season with a knee injury. He will need surgery to repair a
torn ACL. Dominic Rhodes will start at RB for the rest of the year, and
Kevin McDougal should be his backup. Shyrone Stith may also see some work
if needed. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 11/15/01
Graham may post good numbers at Oakland. San Diego will look to the air
often if the Raiders concentrate on stopping the run.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/15/01
Tomlinson may have a disappointing outing this week. Oakland's defense will
be fired up to stuff the run after a very poor performance at Seattle.

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/15/01
Rice has not helped his Fantasy owners much in recent weeks. But he is
still worth a start against the inconsistent San Diego secondary.

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/15/01
Brown should have another good game this week. He always seems to play his
best in intradivisional matchups.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 11/15/01
Don't expect good numbers from Garner this week. He might not do much
against a tough San Diego run defense.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/15/01
Wheatley is now listed as probable for Sunday's game against San Diego. He
is a risky start because of his recent inactivity and the strength of the
San Diego defense.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/15/01
Gannon should rebound from a quiet week. Expect good numbers in an
important home game with San Diego.

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/15/01
Gary was inactive for the last two games, but he will now see carries again
because Terrell Davis is injured. He still may not play enough to help most
Fantasy teams.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/15/01
Clark will continue to get regular looks from Brian Griese. The Denver QB
will now lean heavily on his TEs, because injuries and other factors have
crippled the Broncos at wideout.

Dwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Team Chick Updated 11/15/01
Expect Carswell to be a regular target for Brian Griese this week. Injuries
at WR will make the Denver TEs more important in the passing game.

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 11/15/01
McNabb had a huge game against Minnesota last weekend, and should have more
success on Sunday at Dallas. He's a top-notch Fantasy quarterback worthy of
a weekly spot in your starting lineup. 

Freddie Mitchell, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Mitchell sprained his ankle last Sunday, but is expected to play this
weekend against Dallas. He may emerge as Philadelphia's No. 2 receiver with
a few more good outings, and is worth stashing away on your roster. 

Keith Poole, WR DEN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/15/01
Poole may see a lot of action at wideout for the Broncos this week.
Injuries have hit Denver hard, possibly pressing Poole into extra playing
time. He has never been a reliable Fantasy wideout in the past, so don't
use Poole until he proves he can be a factor in Denver's passing game.

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/15/01
Pinkston has fallen out of favor with Fantasy owners after a strong start
to the season. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Pinkston isn't
even worth a roster spot at this point. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 11/15/01
Lewis had a subpar game against Minnesota last week, but he's still one of
the better tight ends in the league. He had two touchdowns against Dallas
earlier in the year, and is worth starting in Week 10. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/15/01
Thrash has caught four touchdown passes in his last two games, and is worth
starting this week against Dallas. He may be inconsistent at times, but
when Thrash is good, he is capable of putting up solid Fantasy numbers. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/15/01
Griese's stats may be mediocre this week. The Broncos have been hurt by
injuries at wideout, and Griese may have trouble finding open receivers
downfield.

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 11/15/01
Galloway was terrible last week against Atlanta, mostly because of Ryan
Leaf's inability to get the ball downfield effectively. Unless you play in
a deeper league, Galloway isn't worth starting in Week 10. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Harris had two catches for eight yards and a touchdown last weekend, but
he's been unreliable overall. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league,
Harris isn't worth a roster spot.

"Denver Deals","Paul,

Could you set aside some time today to talk to me about the recent Kennedy Oil deal in addition to 2 other deals.  These other deals were discovered in our bid week preparations, and are causing our desk some pretty big negative Prior Month Adjustments.  So, we need to get these resolved.  The first one is the Williams / wic deal. The deal #'s for that are 121890,854562, & 1068893.  The reason for the split of this deal is b/c our books changed names.  The second deal in question which needs to be resolved a.s.a.p. is a Red Rock Energy LLC deal #133661.  This deal is being booked to Denver in Sitara, but in Tagg the risk is going to Keith Holst and Mike Grigsby.  

Please look over these deals and let me know when a good time to talk will be.  Thank you!

 Pilot Humor...
 During taxi, the crew of a US Air departure flight to Ft.Lauderdale made a
wrong turn and came nose to nose with a United 727. The irate ground
controller (a female) lashed out at the US Air crew screaming ""US Air 2771,
where are you going? I told you to turn right on Charlie taxi way; you
turned right on Delta. Stop right there. I know it's difficult to tell the
difference between C's and D's but get it right"". Continuing her lashing to
the embarrassed crew, she was now shouting hysterically, ""God, you've
screwed everything up; it'll take forever to sort this out. You stay right
there and don't move until I tell you to. You can expect progressive taxi
instructions in about a half hour and I want you to go exactly where tell
you, when I tell you, and how I tell you. You got that, USAir 2771??""

 The humbled crew responded: ""Yes Ma'am"". Naturally, the ground control
frequency went terribly silent after the verbal bashing of US Air Flight
2771. No one wanted to engage the irate ground controller in her current
state. Tension in every cockpit at LGA was running high.

 Shortly after the controller finished her admonishment of the U.S. Air
crew, an unknown male pilot broke the silence and asked: ""Wasn't I married
to you once?""

4:30 came early this morning.  It always does.  Of course I didn't make it
to bed until 10:30 again so I only got 6 hours of sleep.  Makes for a ""many
coca cola afternoon"".

Will call you tomorrow to let you know when/where we'll be.

"Support the Bronco's and the WTC Victims","This really only takes 30 seconds.  See below.

I just did it!  It's fast and easy.  So no excuses for not getting soup
donated.  All of you have 1 minute to spare! People in New York and DC are
going to be having to hit foodbanks hard. There will be a need in NY for
the soup.  Below is an easy way to help....

Campbell's is donating a can of soup to area foodbanks just by clicking on
a football helmet at their website. Now, I know there are some pretty
diehard football fans out there.

Let's see which team gets the most support and help some hungry people,
too! It's quick, easy, and can be done once a day.  To date Steelers have
about 240,000 cans donated - Green Bay has over 254,000.

The Broncos only have 61,000.  Come of Fans, kick in your support.

Here is a hyper link to directly connect you to their website. Just click
on this web address:  http://www.chunky.com/click_for_cans.asp
then click on your favorite team's helmet and Campbell will donated a can
of soup.  That is it!  Please pass this to a friend or 2,3,4...

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

<<  Subject: What is 100%?



We have all been to those meetings where someone wants over 100  percent.
How about achieving 103 percent?  Here's a little math that might prove
helpful in the future. What makes life 100 percent?

If   A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z can be represented
as:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26

Then,

It stands to reason that hardwork and knowledge will get you close, but
attitude and bullshit will put you over the top.

hi. I saw your profile and you seem like an interesting person. Take a
look at mine and email back if you want to talk more.

Click the following link to view the sender's profile:
http://www.match.com/doubleblind/showprofile.asp?UserID=48464C4D494D47&t
rackingid=0

The following is my profile text:

Some people would describe me as ""having a lot of energy,"" friendly,
outgoing, intuitive and kind. I am physically fit, but not perfect. I
enjoy working out by going to the gym, hiking, mountain biking and
snowshoeing. I am in the Consulting sales and management area. For fun I
love to hang out with my friends and family, go on spontaneous
adventurous trips, go to parties, read, hike and attend sporting events.
The types of music that move me are songs that actually have something
to say about life and romantic, classical music. I am the happiest when
I'm healthy and everything is going great. I am happy when I'm with my
family and friends and the person that I am with. I am the most at peace
when I am away from noise and surrounded by beauty. What I have done
that makes me the proudest of myself is achieving things that I thought
I never could. If I could invite any 5 people to dinner it would be my
parents, my best friend, the person that I'm in love with and my
favorite cousin. My idea of a perfect date is having a nice dinner and
staying up all night talking. I am looking for someone who is easy to
talk to, non-judgemental, and who enjoys life to the fullest. I am not
the type of person who likes to meet people in a bar setting. I am
looking for someone who makes me laugh and appreciates who I am.

	I'm putting one up - I just sent it in to be
	scanned/approved, whatever they do, I just didn't at
	first because I wasn't really gung ho about doing this
	- I sort of just filled out the profile and sat back.
	But I think it's actually pretty cool.  I'm surprised
	there are so many normal people doing this, aren't
	you?  So, what made you decide to do this?  And will
	you ever tell anyone that you did/are???

Latest NFL Player News

Rickey Dudley, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/09/01
The Browns have placed Dudley on injured reserve with a foot injury,
officially ending his season. Drop him if he was on your Fantasy roster.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/09/01
Pathon is expected to miss Sunday's game because of a sprained foot. He
suffered the injury in Indianapolis' previous game against the Patriots.
Terrence Wilkins or Reggie Wayne will start in his place. Consider
reserving Pathon this week. 

Ty Detmer, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Detmer was benched on Monday night after another poor outing. He was
replaced by Charlie Batch and may have lost his starting QB spot. In any
event, neither signal-caller has much Fantasy value.

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/09/01
Barlow is still being hampered by a quadriceps injury, but will continue to
play despite the ailment. ""It happened, what, two months ago? And it
probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to work through it,""
Barlow told the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I>. ""People don't know how bad
this is hurting."" The injury could hamper Barlow's playing time in the
future, so be cautious when starting him Fantasy-wise. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/09/01
Stokes, who injured his knee during Sunday's win over Carolina, is listed
as probable for this weekend's contest at Atlanta. He's been inconsistent
thus far, and shouldn't be depended on to produce Fantasy-wise. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/09/01
According to Head Coach Andy Reid, Staley's shoulder injury will not cost
him the starting RB spot. However, he did say that Staley will be eased
back into the role after the team's bye week, so expect Correll Buckhalter
to see the majority of the carries when Philly plays the N.Y. Giants on
October 22. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/09/01
Franks suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's loss to Tampa Bay. The
injury isn't considered serious, however, and Franks is expected to start
this weekend against Baltimore. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Ismail (knee) will work into drills this week, which means that there is a
possibility that he will return for Monday's game against Washington. Even
if he does return, he's not worth starting for a Fantasy perspective. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Harris, who has been struggling with a groin injury, is expected to
participate in drills this week. He'll likely be available for Monday's
game against Washington, barring any setbacks. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/09/01
With Quincy Carter out for two weeks, Wright will be Dallas' starting QB
for at least next week's game. You may actually want to consider starting
Wright this week against Washington, but you'd have to be pretty desperate. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Carter is now expected to miss four-to-six weeks due to a hamstring injury.
Anthony Wright will start in Carter's place, but neither QB has much
Fantasy value at this point. 

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Baxter (hip), who was inactive for Sunday's game against Atlanta, could be
out for this weekend's game as well. The veteran tight end has very little
value as a Fantasy player at this point, so the injury won't make a huge
impact. 

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 10/09/01
Allen will remain the Bears' No. 1 tailback, at least for the moment.
Rookie Anthony Thomas will see an increase in playing time, however, so
Allen's Fantasy value will likely take a hit. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/09/01
According to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>, Thomas will not take over the
starting RB spot in Chicago, at least not yet. Head Coach Dick Jaroun will
stick with current No. 1 tailback James Allen for the time being, but
Thomas will see an increase in playing time and is worth picking up
Fantasy-wise. 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Defensive end Bruce Smith, who was knocked out of Sunday's game against the
Giants with a dislocated right shoulder, will miss two to three weeks while
the tissue in his right shoulder heals and he regains his strength and
range of motion. You shouldn't be using the Redskins' defense on a weekly
basis in a Fantasy league to begin with.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01
Johnson suffered a shoulder contusion when it was driven into the ground
during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay. He should be
fine for Week Five, but see how he fares in practice before making a
decision on starting him next week.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
The Giants said that Barber should be able to return from a hamstring
injury next Sunday in St. Louis. However, it is unclear whether he will get
the majority of the carries over Ron Dayne, so be careful starting either
unless the Giants' RB picture clears up by then.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Dayne left Sunday's game against Washington with a neck stinger, an injury
which the Giants said was not serious. He should be able to play next
Sunday in St. Louis.

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/08/01
Bradford left Sunday's game in Tampa Bay with cramps after returning a
kickoff. He will be re-evaluated on Monday.

Ryan Leaf, QB TB - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
The Cowboys remain interest in Leaf despite ligament damage in his wrist,
according to the <I>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</I>. They may sign him to the
roster and place him on injured reserve. Leaf offers no Fantasy value at
this stage of his career.

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Carter said the next 48 hours would determine whether he will be able to
play a week from Monday against Washington, according to <I>The Dallas
Morning News</I>. He has a strained left hamstring that he said he felt pop
during the first quarter of Sunday's game. Carter isn't a recommended
Fantasy starter even when healthy.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Hasselbeck (groin) missed Seattle's win over Jacksonville and watched Trent
Dilfer lead the team to 24 points. Still, Mike Holmgren claimed the injured
Hasselbeck will remain Seattle's starter. ""I said it before and I'll say it
again,"" Holmgren told the <i>Seattle Times</i>. ""Matt Hasselbeck is our
quarterback."" Hasselbeck's status for Seattle's next game is unclear.

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/08/01
Coles sprained his ankle at Buffalo. The injury is not considered to be
serious.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Luccis Losers Updated 10/08/01
Glenn is eligible to start practicing, but the Patriots have applied for a
roster exemption so he can get into playing shape. Don't expect him to be a
solid contributor to the New England passing game in the near future. When
he will make his return to the lineup is still unclear.

Ray Lucas, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Lucas appeared in short-yardage sets on Sunday. He still won't play often
enough to affect Jay Fiedler's numbers.

Kevin Kasper, WR DEN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Kasper suffered a severely sprained right ankle on Sunday and will miss
three to six weeks. Travis McGriff or Chris Cole might see more time in the
passing game while Kasper is out.

Rickey Dudley, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Dudley played with a sprained foot on Sunday. He is not expected to miss
any playing time.

Patrick Johnson, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Johnson is expected to miss eight weeks with a clavicle injury. He had
already started to fall behind the emerging Travis Taylor as a preferred
target in the passing game.

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/08/01
Weinke was extremely ineffective against the Niners Sunday. He completed
only 29 of 47 passes for 275 yards. Three of his incompletions resulted in
interceptions while he threw only one touchdown pass. Weinke was effective
in the season opener but has proven to be a Fantasy reserve at best. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Walls proved to be quarterback Chris Weinke's best target Sunday against
the 49ers catching 10 passes for 91 yards and a score. Walls won't do this
every week but he will get a lot of looks from Weinke when he can't find
his receivers. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Owens was productive once again on Sunday, catching eight passes for 118
yards and two scores. Look for him to do well next week against Atlanta. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01
Hearst did not score but provided decent production Sunday against the
Panthers gaining 74 yards on 18 carries. He is not starter material at this
point but will be a good backup in most Fantasy leagues. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Garcia was solid once again in Sunday's game against the Panthers. He threw
for 212 yards and two touchdown passes against only one interception. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01
Brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance Sunday. He
only threw for 210 yards with an interception and no touchdown passes.
Brooks has struggled in the last two games but the Saints will stick with
him as the starter since they are winning games. 

Michael Vick, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01
Vick was an adequate replacement for the injured Chris Chandler but he
failed to lead the Falcons to the end zone. He completed 12 of 18 passes
for 186 yards and also gained 23 yards on four carries. Look for Vick to
return to the bench next week. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Jeffers (knees) missed Sunday's game against San Francisco. He continues to
make progress in his recovery from multiple knee surgeries, but isn't ready
to return to action just yet. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01
Barlow recently revealed that he is playing with a quadriceps injury that
has hampered his ability since training camp. ""It happened, what, two
months ago? And it probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to
work through it,"" Barlow told <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>. ""People
don't know how bad this is hurting."" Barlow will continue to play but the
injury might prevent him from taking over as the full-time running back.
Keep him on your bench for now. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Jefferson missed most of the second half of Sunday's game due to neck and
back injuries. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Receivers Terance
Mathis, Brian Finneran and Quentin McCord will be the wideouts next week if
he is inactive. 

Nick Goings, RB CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Goings was inactive for Sunday's game as Tim Biakabutuka resumed his job as
the starting running back. Keep Goings on your bench for now. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Biakabutuka started Sunday's game after being benched a week earlier. He
wasn't too effective gaining 45 yards on 10 rushes. Biakabutuka also caught
two passes for 22 yards. Keep Biakabutuka on your bench if you have depth
at running back. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01
Chandler left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury was
diagnosed as a Grade 1 concussion, the least severe on the scale. He is
listed as day to day. Michael Vick will start next Sunday if he is unable
to play. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/08/01
Stokes sprained his knee in Sunday's game, but stayed in the contest. He
will be evaluated on a daily basis. Stokes had just one catch in the game
for six yards. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Coles caught five passes for 77 yards and carried the ball two times for 15
yards at Buffalo. Coles has apparently become an important part of the New
York offense in his second pro season.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Becht caught three passes for 21 yards and a TD at Buffalo. Despite some
early struggles, Becht still appears to be an key member of the New York
passing game on third downs and near the goal line.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Price caught four passes for 103 yards and a TD against the Jets. Don't
expect big numbers from Price again in the near future. He very rarely
breaks loose for a big play. The 70-yard TD pass he caught in Week Four is
not one of his usual feats.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/07/01
Henry rushed for 113 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Against
low-quality defenses that appear on the schedule, Henry should continue to
be a good Fantasy option. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
McCardell caught seven passes for 97 yards at Seattle. The veteran wideout
looks to be in good health again, and should be a solid Fantasy starter for
the rest of the year.

Itula Mili, TE SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Mili caught two passes for 42 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. Mili is
quick, and has good hands. He is worth a look if you need help at the tight
end position.

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Alexander rushed for 176 yards on 31 carries and scored two TDs against
Jacksonville. He will continue to be a good Fantasy starter while Ricky
Watters is out, and Alexander seems to be more of a TD threat than Watters
can be right now.

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Mack was benched at Seattle on Sunday in the second quarter after rushing
for only 17 yards on eight carries. On his final attempt of the day, he
lost a fumble, and was replaced by rookie Elvis Joseph. The first-year back
rushed for only 39 yards and fumbled as well, but he caught an 18-yard TD
pass. Now there will be major questions as to who will start the next game
at RB for the Jaguars if Fred Taylor is not ready to return from a groin
injury after the bye week.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Wheatley scored two TDs against Dallas on Sunday. His rushing totals (33
yards) were modest, however, and it's still tough to start him on a weekly
basis due to the presence of Charlie Garner. 

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Brown caught seven passes for 114 yards in Oakland's win over Dallas. He
continues to be one of the more consistent receivers in the league from a
Fantasy perspective. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/07/01
Dallas tried to open up their offense against Oakland, and Galloway's
numbers improved slightly as a result. He had his best game of the season,
posting 59 yards receiving and a TD. Those are modest numbers, however, so
don't think of starting him on a weekly basis. 

Aaron Stecker, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/07/01
Stecker rushed for only six yards on two carries against Green Bay. He does
not appear to be a viable option for the Buccaneers while Warrick Dunn is
out. Tampa Bay apparently still has faith in Mike Alstott.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Smith was held in check once again, posting only 46 yards of total offense
against Oakland. Without an effective passing game, Smith is going to have
a long season. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Wright took over at QB for Dallas after Quincy Carter left in the first
quarter with a strained hamstring. He completed 14-of-22 for 126 yards and
two TDs against Oakland, but still has very little value as a Fantasy
player. 

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/07/01
Alstott rushed for 77 yards on 15 carries and a TD against the Packers. The
big fullback proved he can still be a dependable Fantasy RB.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Wycheck left Sunday's game against Baltimore with a neck strain. He did not
return to the game, and will be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Freeman caught only one pass for six yards at Tampa Bay. With the emergence
of Bill Schroeder, Freeman has become the less desirable option of Green
Bay's starting wideouts.

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Gary carried the ball only nine times for 28 yards in Denver's 20-6 win
over Kansas City. He may have slipped to No. 2 on the depth chart behind
Mike Anderson. 

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Anderson posted 155 yards rushing and a score against Kansas City on
Sunday. He received much more of the workload in the Denver backfield than
Olandis Gary, and may be emerging as the team's No. 1 back. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/07/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 119 yards and a TD at Tampa Bay. The Green
Bay wideout performed well against a very tough defense, proving he has
indeed become a quality Fantasy player.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Smith had another huge outing, posting eight receptions for 110 yards and a
score against Kansas City. Smith is establishing himself as one of the best
wideouts in the league this season, and should be in your starting lineup
on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Griese struggled for the second consecutive week, posting only 121 yards
passing and a TD against Kansas City. Griese's numbers are being hurt
somewhat by the loss of Ed McCaffrey, but he still warrants a weekly
starting spot in most leagues Fantasy-wise.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Holmes put up decent numbers against Denver, posting seven receptions and
100 yards of total offense. He's not worthy of a starting spot every week,
but he could be useful when the matchup is right. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Green came back to earth after a solid performance last weekend against
Washington. Green was picked off four times by the Denver defense and was
held without a TD pass in the Chiefs' 20-6 loss. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/07/01
Johnson left Sunday's game vs. Green Bay for a brief period in the third
quarter with an apparent shoulder injury. He returned to the game after an
examination on the sidelines.

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/07/01
Smith rushed for 71 yards on 17 carries against the Bears. Smith lacks the
speed and burst to be a solid Fantasy RB for the rest of the year. Don't
count on him as anything more than a reserve, despite the respectable look
of his final Week Four numbers.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/07/01
Robinson caught nine passes for 114 yards and a TD against the Falcons.
Robinson has reclaimed his spot among Fantasy Football's top wideouts now
that he is healthy again.

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Jenkins caught six passes for 119 yards and a TD against the Eagles. Don't
expect such totals from Jenkins on a regular basis. He might draw more
defensive attention in the coming weeks, and has never proved he can put up
good numbers in the past.

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Pinkston caught four passes for 90 yards and two TDs against the Cardinals.
The young wideout has quickly emerged as a quality Fantasy player because
of his good hands, concentration and leaping ability.

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Buckhalter rushed for 134 yards on 21 carries against Arizona. The rookie
has put up fine yardage numbers in his pair of starts in place of the
injured Duce Staley.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Plummer threw for 238 yards, two TDs and an interception in a win over
Philadelphia. His respectable performance against the Eagles' strong
defense should convince many Fantasy owners to take a chance on him as a
backup.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/07/01
Fiedler threw for only 87 yards and a TD and was intercepted once by the
Patriots. Don't depend on Fiedler for quality Fantasy numbers on a weekly
basis.

James McKnight, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
McKnight caught two passes for just 17 yards against the Patriots. The
veteran wideout cannot be counted on for reliable Fantasy production.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Brown caught five passes for 47 yards at Miami. His numbers may suffer
until Drew Bledsoe is healthy again. Tom Brady does not have the arm
strength to take advantage of Brown's deep gears on a regular basis.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Minnis (concussion) was in the starting lineup for Kansas City on Sunday.
He was originally listed as questionable for the game, but was able to go.
The rookie posted five receptions for 56 yards in the game. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Smith rushed for 47 yards and a TD at Miami. While he may not post
consistently good yardage numbers the rest of the year, Smith will continue
to be a TD threat.

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/07/01
Johnson was taken to the locker room in the first half of Sunday's game
with a pinched nerve in his neck. He was replaced by Alex Van Pelt and did
not return.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Anderson has received most of the carries in the first half of Sunday's
game against Kansas City. In fact, he has already rushed for 106 yards and
a score midway through the first half. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Carter left Sunday's game against Oakland in the first quarter due to a
strained left hamstring. He did not return to the game, and will be
re-evaluared on Monday. Anthony Wright replaced the rookie QB in the lineup
for Dallas. 

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Taylor had his second consecutive good outing on Sunday, posting five
receptions and a touchdown in Baltimore's 26-7 victory over Tennessee. If
he continues to produce, Taylor may warrant a starting role from a Fantasy
perspective on a more regular basis. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/07/01
Warrick caught four passes for just 39 yards against the Steelers. Jon
Kitna has been working more exclusively with Darnay Scott, and Warrick
hasn't put up good Fantasy numbers yet this season.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Brookins saw an increase in his carries on Sunday against Tennessee, and
his numbers really reflected it. He posted 68 yards and a touchdown in
Baltimore's 26-7 victory, and could see more playing time in the Ravens'
offense from now on. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/07/01
Ward caught eight passes 68 yards against the Bengals. He continues to be
Pittsburgh's only reliable wide receiver, and now qualifies as a solid
Fantasy reserve.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/07/01
Allen finally had a productive game, posting 108 yards rushing and a
touchdown against Tennessee. However, he still isn't a player that Fantasy
owners should depend on for consistent production. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Kinney had a solid game against Baltimore, posting seven catches for 75
yards. He is putting a dent into Frank Wycheck's numbers early in the year,
and will likely play a more prominent role in the Titans' offense this
season. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Bettis rushed for 153 yards on 24 carries against Cincinnati. He will
continue to stack up good numbers from a yardage perspective, but the
Pittsburgh offense is not giving him enough scoring opportunities.

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Despite a slight shoulder injury, Williams was impressive on Sunday against
Minnesota. He posted 178 yards of total offense and a touchdown in the
Saints' 28-15 win. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/07/01
Jackson led New Orleans with six catches for 95 yards against Minnesota on
Sunday. He has become QB Aaron Brooks' favorite target and is slowly
becoming a more consistent Fantasy player. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Bennett was held in check once again, posting only 36 yards of total
offense against New Orleans. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may
want to consider dropping Bennett altogether. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/07/01
Brunell started Sunday's game at Seattle. He had been listed as
questionable with recurring headaches.

Damon Washington, RB NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Washington was impressive after replacing the injured Ron Dayne on Sunday,
posting 106 scrimmage yards against the Redskins. He did fumbled twice,
however, and probably won't get the opportunity to see extensive playing
time again unless both Dayne and Tiki Barber are unable to go next week. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/07/01
Chandler sustained a mild concussion in the second quarter of Sunday's game
against the Chicago Bears. Michael Vick played the entire second half at QB
for Atlanta.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Davis had another rough outing, posting just 39 yards rushing on Sunday
against the N.Y. Giants. With Washington's offense struggling, Fantasy
owners may want to consider dealing Davis within the next few weeks. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Banks was horrible against the N.Y. Giants, completing 13-of-31 for only
151 yards and two interceptions. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a
roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Patrick Johnson, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Johnson fractured his clavicle during Sunday's game against Tennessee. He
will likely miss a few weeks of action due to the injury. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Jackson (ribs) was in the starting lineup for Cleveland on Sunday. He
rushed for 68 yards and a touchdown in the Browns' 20-16 victory over San
Diego. 

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Tomlinson had another huge game, rushing for 102 yards and a touchdown
against Cleveland. The rookie from TCU is quickly becoming one of the best
RBs in the entire league, and is worthy of a starting spot on your Fantasy
team on weekly basis. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
George left Sunday's game against Baltimore in the second half due an ankle
injury. He was replaced in the backfield by Mike Green. George did not
return to the game, but he was seen testing the ankle on the sidelines and
will likely be available for next week's game against Tampa Bay.

"RE:","Thanks.  That Kennedy Oil deal still needs to be in Sitara b/c it is causing an imbalance in my positions.  If the deal is in Tagg, it needs to be in Sitara. Does that make sense?  Let me know.

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

ADDITIONAL TIPS from Match.com:

Our anonymous re-mailer will strip away your real email address, so 
that it will NOT appear in the 'From:' line.

You may also contact this person from their Match.com profile by 
clicking 'Contact this person' and composing your message directly from the

However:

* Check to ensure that your email address is not in the BODY of your

* Check to ensure that you REMOVE ANY AUTOMATIC SIGNATURE at the end of 

your email. And note that you cannot use 'Cc:' or 'Bcc:' if you want 
your email to remain anonymous.

"FW: Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Wright, Lee  
Sent:	Thursday, October 18, 2001 4:37 PM
To:	Bodyshop
Subject:	Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage


To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

I talked to my boss this morning about moving our group to another company.  It seems one of the larger natural gas producers wants to start a group like ours.  We interview soon!  I'll keep you posted.  Let's talk soon.

"RE:","
Paul,

The A&M game was tragic.  My friend Tim and I went to watch it at a sports
bar and, needless to say, I was the only Aggie fan in the crowd.  We had a
chance to tie it or win it in the last two minutes.  We had driven the ball
from our own 9 yard line to about the CU 30 yard line.  We had a first down
and were going for it when we fumbled ($%&*!!) and they took it back for a
touchdown.  The waitress felt sorry for me and bought us a shot of I don't
even know what.  I'm headed to Texas in a couple of weeks to see the Aggies
Beat the Hell Outta Iowa State at Kyle Field.  I haven't been to Kyle Field
in ages so I'm really looking forward to it.

Petrogulf's agreement indicates they have access to all major delivery
points except Opal until the expansion is in place.  These other points
would include QGM, MGR, OTTCO and QPL.  It's a bit curious to me that they
would have QPL and OTTCO now since they have to go down the 20"" to get
there.  Seems like these would be in the same boat with the Opal option, so
maybe this is not a true, current option.  Can't Petrogulf tell you this
stuff?  It's not my place to do it, and the only reason I am is because
you're going to drop a large sum of money taking me out to dinner
(kidding!!).

As for dinner, yes I'm still available.  As for the place, don't feel like
you need to drop a bunch of cash (although cash is thrilling, isn't it??).
I'm happy eating just about anything.  I'm trying to be on a new health
kick, so healthy fare sounds appealing.  My only condition is that I can't
stay out late because I have a 5:30am appointment at the gym with my
trainer Thurs. am.  It's brutal.  I leave the house at 5am.  Want to stay
downtown or venture out?

Hello,

I'm back in the office today.  Well I see you have to eat crow!  I
didn't get a chance to watch the game but I saw CU play Kansas St. and
CU looked good. I even think CU has a good chance of beating UT in
Austin this weekend.

As far as Petrogulf goes, in the mean time before the great expansion,
do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline
delivery points.  I think they can take their gas in kind at
Questar/Bird Canyon, but I'm not sure.

And finally, are you still available for dinner Wednesday night.  I just
got paid so I'm looking to take you some place nice.  Yes, I am bribing
you!

Paul

Paul,

Once the expansion is completed (in the next couple of months),
Petrogulf
will have access to all delivery points off Jonah.  They currently don't
have access to Opal.  I think that's all the super secret information I
can
divulge.

Hope you have a great weekend.  I have a small wager with Shari Wojta
that
the Fightin' Texas Aggies will Beat the Hell Outta CU tomorrow.  Hope I
don't have to eat crow.

See you next week.

I am hoping you can make a similar change to the included deal number.  I have yet to hear from Paul on this deal.  Can you confirm the correct counterparty as CMS Field Services?

Paul,

We have the above Sep-01 production deal on WIC pipeline in the system under CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company.  However, the counterparty is billing us under CMS Field Services, Inc.  These two counterparties settle differently.  Please confirm the correct counterparty name if possible.

 I think we should all meet somewhere for drinks and go from there. Please e-mail Tim, and also give me his address for Carolyn.
Let me know what you think so I can at least alert Carolyn as well.

Hi Paul,
 
Ran into ""Tim"" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our ""get together"" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
 
Take care,
Debbe.

Paul,

Hi.  On the Petrogulf deal, are you proposing Enron or Petrogulf gets the
tport contract on OTTCO?  I'm assuming right now the tport will be with
Enron.  I also assume you are purchasing Petrogulf's gas at the Jonah
delivery point into OTTCO since Petrogulf will have to use their Jonah
contract to get it through that system.  I think you said you wanted WIC
space for November and December.  How much are you talking about?  If it's
only Petrogulf you're purchasing, we're probably talking no more than
3mmcf/d.  Please confirm Monday a.m.  We'll be meeting sometime Monday
morning to go over the allocation at the Jonah JT skid (the point of
constraint on getting into OTTCO since it's beyond full) and our system
supply situation for OTTCO for November.  Remember Petrogulf will have to
sign a processing contract with Jonah for the JT skid.  If they plan to
process at Opal after the expansion is complete, they will have to put
together a deal with Williams or use yours, if you have one.

How special do you feel that I'm working on your deal on a Sunday
afternoon??

Subject: Dear Abby.......


Dear  Abby , 
I met Laurie at a singles dance.  I knew as soon as I looked at her that she 
was too young for me. I'm 49 and she was 32 , 17 years my junior. I really 
regretted it because we got along so well that evening. She made me feel so 
comfortable in her presence.  Our age difference didn't seem to matter to 
her as much as it did to me. 
Abby, I told her I felt people were staring at us.  I said they are probably 
wondering if I am your father.  She thought I was being silly and said if I 
wanted to see her again she would be honored to go out with me. 
Laurie and I have been dating now for three months.  I really like her and I 
think she likes me.  Still, everywhere we go, I feel people watching us. 
Sometimes they just outright stare.  It is very annoying and I know it is 
because of our age difference that draws these prolonged looks from everyone 
we meet.  I just feel so uncomfortable about this whole thing and wonder if 
I should continue with the relationship. Why do people have to be so 
rude....? 
Sincerely, 
John 
PS: I have attached a picture of Laurie.

Hi Paul,
 
Ran into ""Tim"" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our ""get together"" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
 
Take care,
Debbe.

Subject:	Denver Deals

Paul,

Could you set aside some time today to talk to me about the recent Kennedy Oil deal in addition to 2 other deals.  These other deals were discovered in our bid week preparations, and are causing our desk some pretty big negative Prior Month Adjustments.  So, we need to get these resolved.  The first one is the Williams / wic deal. The deal #'s for that are 121890,854562, & 1068893.  The reason for the split of this deal is b/c our books changed names.  The second deal in question which needs to be resolved a.s.a.p. is a Red Rock Energy LLC deal #133661.  This deal is being booked to Denver in Sitara, but in Tagg the risk is going to Keith Holst and Mike Grigsby.  

Please look over these deals and let me know when a good time to talk will be.  Thank you!

Latest NFL Player News

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Hasselbeck is scheduled to start the Seahawks' next game October 28 against Miami due to a groin injury suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. ""Matt has had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever he has to prove,"" Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter right now, especially against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.

Trent Dilfer <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Up! da! ted 10/16/01
Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he is not expected to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ""There's more to it than just a normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that,"" Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. ""He's injured, and he won't practice this week."" Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.

Tony Richardson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1471&>, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/! ht! tp://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/16/01
Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were expected back Tuesday.

Lamar Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against the Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.

Brian Griese <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Really Rottens! Updated 10/16/01
The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego, according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.

Rob Johnson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.

Jamal Anderson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&lea! gu! e=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1076&>, RB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/16/01
Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/16/01
Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. ""He really could possibly play this week,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""We're not going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out."" If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation throug! ho! ut the week. 

Justin McCareins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=235117&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards. 

Eddie Berlin <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=235023&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams, will be sidelined three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a kickoff return Sun! da! y.

Dennis Northcutt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Browns' head coach Butch Davis told The Akron Plain-Dealer that Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout this week. 

Peter Warrick <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.

Marco Battaglia <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scr! ip! t=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1324&> , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is suffering from a strained left shoulder. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared hims! el! f fit enough to play. ""I'm still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see if I was alive,"" he said, ""but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready."" 

Redskins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the injury and is currently listed as day-to-day. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as day-to-day. 

Duce Staley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&lea! gu! e=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12484&>, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/16/01
Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1593&>, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons! Updated 10/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we expect him to go. 

Joey Galloway <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game. 

Reggie Swinton <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as day-to-day. 

Jackie Harris <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Quincy Carter <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday.! H! e is expected to miss six weeks of action due to the procedure. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact Fantasy-wise. 

Tiki Barber <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Michael Pittman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/http! :/! /football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would step into the No. 1 RB role once again. 

Randy Moss <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from playing at full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad idea if your roster allows for a solid repl! ac! ement. 

Doug Chapman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=187510&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good numbers against a solid Packers' defense. 

Michael Bennett <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3300&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
According to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Bennett (ankle) is expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a protective boot on Monday and was walkin! g ! with a noticeable limp. Doug Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's absence.

Would you call Adele and see if and/or how much our Medicine Bow capacity will be affected for the 30th?
We will have to make sure and sell the difference at Glenrock into KN.

One unit at the Douglas Station on WIC will be out of service October 30, 2001 for approximately 8 hours.  Throughput for this period will be reduced to a rate of about 360 MMcf/d with a total daily throughput estimated at 450 MMCf/d.  

As this will directly effect all gas coming out of the Powder River, please contact your marketer directly as to how much gas they will be able to deliver into WIC on that day.  Allocations will be based on WIC allocation methods.

Latest NFL Player News

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect much from Alstott this week. Warrick Dunn is healthy enough to
start again, and will be the featured back against Pittsburgh.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect huge numbers from Morton in Sunday's game against Tennessee.
He'll give your Fantasy team a slight boost if the Lions are forced to pass
if they fall behind early, but we recommend you only use Morton if you're
thin at wide receiver.

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Stewart will have a hard time racking up good Fantasy stats Sunday against
a Tennessee linebacking corps that can cover a lot of ground. Start him
only if you don't have two other backs on your team with better matchups.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Chamberlain is definitely a good start this week. He will become a major
factor if the Packers focus too much on Minnesota's wide receivers.

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Booker would make an excellent Fantasy starter in his game Sunday against
the Bengals. Cincinnati is without cornerback Rodney Heath, which will make
it difficult to defend Booker this week.

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Expect good numbers from Carter this week. He is a big-game player who will
not be flustered by the improved Green Bay defense.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/19/01
Robinson battled a back injury in Week Five, but he should rebound on
Sunday against Cincinnati. The Bears will need to make some deep passes and
we think Robinson would make a solid Fantasy starter this week.

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Green Bay's defense has played well so far, but Culpepper won't be
intimidated by the Packers. He has faced them many times before, and should
fare well in an important divisional game in front of the home crowd.

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Miller will need to throw the deep ball often Sunday against the
overaggressive Bengals. He should post adequate Fantasy numbers, making him
a solid starter if you don't have any other superstar QBs to choose from.

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Green will get the bulk of his numbers in the second half if Green Bay can
get ahead of Minnesota early. He will definitely be good for at least one
TD.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Favre should have another excellent game this week. Minnesota's secondary
will not be able to handle him, especially with CB Robert Tate ailing.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/19/01
Dunn sat out practice Thursday with a sprained right big toe, but is
expected to play Sunday against Pittsburgh. He faces a tough challenge in
the Steelers' stingy rush defense, so consider reserving him if you have a
more established back on your roster.

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Schroeder missed practice for a second straight day Thursday due to an
ankle injury. However, he is listed as probable on the injury report, and
you should probably start him this week unless he takes a turn for the
worse before gametime.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/19/01
Moss practiced Thursday for the first time since aggravating an ankle
injury on Sunday, and has been upgraded from questionable to probable on
the injury report for Sunday's game against Green Bay. You should
definitely get him into your active Fantasy lineup as a result.

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Matthews could serve as the backup quarterback for the Bears Sunday in
Cincinnati after throwing in drills Thursday. Don't bother with him, as
he's not going to get much playing time the rest of the season behind Jim
Miller on the depth chart.

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Baxter practiced Thursday and hopes to be able to play Sunday in
Cincinnati, according to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>. He has been
recovering from a neck injury, but isn't worth your Fantasy attention.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Griese (shoulder) practiced with the first-team offense, and looked good,
Mike Shanahan told the <I>Denver Post</i>. He is expected to start against
San Diego. ""I think he did pretty good,"" coach Mike Shanahan said. ""He
practiced the whole practice. It didn't look like there was anything wrong.
I'm not sure how painful it is because I haven't talked to him, but so far,
so good."" 

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Wilkins (ribs) is not expected to play against the Patriots. He is listed
as doubtful.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
The effects of a concussion suffered against Miami has kept Chrebet out of
practices this week. He is expected to play against St. Louis.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/19/01
Redmond (ankle) is expected to be in uniform for Sunday's game. But it
appears he will not be used much, because New England has found Antowain
Smith to be a dependable back.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Clark should get open often against San Diego. The Chargers' pass defense
can definitely be exploited over the middle.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Smith should have another fine game this week. He will be the focal point
of the Denver passing game in a contest that will feature a lot of offense.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Anderson may find it difficult to reach 100 yards against the Chargers. San
Diego has a strong front seven, and the Broncos are having trouble with
blocking on end runs.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Jones has been a disappointment so far, but he could be a factor this week,
as the Chargers trade blows with the Broncos in a high-scoring game.

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Graham should produce good numbers this week. The Chargers will probably
engage in a high-scoring game with the Broncos.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Gonzalez will be a prime target against the Cardinals. Kansas City will
certainly see many passing openings over the middle. 

Chris Thomas, WR KC - Uran Man Updated 10/19/01
Thomas has moved into Kansas City's starting lineup. Don't use him unless
you are desperate for help at receiver.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/19/01
The matchup suggests Alexander will do well this week, but the Chiefs will
probably look to keep the ball on the ground, limiting Kansas City's
passing numbers.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect Wycheck to catch a lot of passes this weekend. He hasn't been
featured too heavily in the Titans' passing game and has been used more to
block for running back Eddie George. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/19/01
Mason is suffering from an ankle injury and is listed as questionable for
this week's game against the Lions. Tennessee expects him to play but don't
rely on him being too productive. The injury caused him to miss last week's
game. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Look for Bettis to gain some yards this week, despite the presence of an
imposing Buccaneers defense. He should even reach the end zone. Bettis is
overdue for a touchdown. He had eight rushing TDs last year but has none
this season. 

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 10/19/01
Stewart will have limited success trying to advance the ball this week.
Don't expect him to throw any TD passes. He has just one so far this
season. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/19/01
Ward will struggle to catch passes against a formidable Buccaneers defense
this week. Tampa has one of the best pass defenses in the NFL. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Look for Burress to catch a few passes this week but don't expect him to
score. Burress has not caught a TD pass in four games. He is a third
receiver at best. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/19/01
Holmes should have another big game this week. Arizona's run defense is one
of the worst in football, and Holmes will take complete advantage of the
matchup.

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect Jackson to gain a lot of yards this week against a tough
Baltimore defense. The Ravens have not allowed a running back to run for
over 100 yards against them in over a year. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
According to published reports, Faulk will now definitely miss Sunday's
game against the New York Jets. Faulk missed his third straight practice on
Friday, so the team will go with Trung Canidate as the featured back. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/19/01
Couch probably won't complete a high percentage of his passes but should
throw at least one TD pass. Consider benching him this week if you have a
QB on your roster that has a more favorable matchup. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Johnson played well against the Bengals last week. Look for him to continue
to produce against the Ravens this Sunday. Baltimore looked vulnerable
against the pass last week. Johnson probably won't be as successful as he
was against the Bengals but will be an adequate No. 2 receiver. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/19/01
Dillon will struggle to gain yards against the Bears, who have one of the
top run defenses in the NFL. Don't expect him to get a rushing TD. The
Bears have only allowed one TD run this season. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Kitna will have problems accumulating passing yards against the Bears but
should throw at least one TD pass. He has thrown at least one TD pass in
every game this season. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Warrick is recovering from a bruised shoulder but is expected to play in
Sunday's game against the Bears. Look for Warrick to catch a few passes,
but it will be hard for him to get into the end zone. Warrick has struggled
scoring points and has just one TD reception. 

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Scott will have problems producing against a stout Bears defense. He only
has seven receptions in his past three games. Scott is a No. 3 receiver at
best. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Expect Sharpe to have another solid week, as far as tight ends are
concerned. He is the team's leader in receptions and should get a
reasonable amount of balls thrown his way. Don't be surprised if he scores
a touchdown as well. Sharpe is overdue for a score. He had five TD catches
in 2000 but hasn't scored one this season. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/19/01
Allen should gain some yards this week against a stout Browns defense, but
don't expect him to get any rushing TDs. He only has two rushing TDs this
season. Nevertheless, Allen will be a solid No. 2 back this week. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/19/01
Grbac has been mediocre this season, throwing six TD passes in five games.
Now he will face Cleveland this week and the Browns have one of the best
past defenses. Don't be surprised if Grbac struggles. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Glenn injured his hamstring in practice on Thursday. He may miss Sunday's
game, forcing David Patten back into New England's starting lineup and
making Troy Brown the No. 1 wideout again.

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Muhammad (ribs) returned to practice on Thursday and is expected to start
on Sunday against Washington. Considering the state of the Redskins'
defense, we'd suggest starting Muhammad despite his injury. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/19/01
Weinke missed a portion of practice on Thursday due to a thigh bruise.
However, Head Coach Geroge Seifert expects his rookie quarterback to start
on Sunday against Washington. The matchup against the 'Skins is a good one
for Weinke, who should receive starting consideration from Fantasy owners. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Moore (hamstring) missed practice on Thursday and has been downgraded for
Sunday's game against New Orleans. He'll likely miss yet another week of
action, so keep him on reserve if he's currently on your roster. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
McNair is listed as questionable (shoulder) for Sunday's game against the
Lions but is expected to play. Look for him to score a touchdown by either
running the ball in or throwing. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/19/01
George is listed as questionable on the injury report with an ankle injury
but is expected to play Sunday against Detroit. Look for George to have a
big game against the struggling Lions. 

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Look for Taylor to catch several passes this week and snag at least one
touchdown pass. He has become one of Elvis Grbac's favorite targets inside
the red zone. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Ismail will catch a few passes this week but don't expect him to score any
touchdowns. He has just two TD receptions in five games. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Northcutt has been getting a lot of practice in the No. 2 receiver slot and
might fill-in for the injured Quincy Morgan as a starter. Don't expect
Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an
extra wideout. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
The Chiefs might depend on the run, so Green's numbers may be limited.
Expect one TD pass, but his yardage numbers will be modest.

Ken Dilger, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore.
Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this
week.

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once
again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New
England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this
week.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Wayne is expected to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the
second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in
your Fantasy lineup.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned
Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against
New England.

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was
intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against
them at home this week.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle.
He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green
Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether
he will be able to play.

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving
treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding
whether to use him this week.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might
have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff
didn't hurt him last week.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts
this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in
his second meeting with Indianapolis.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good
week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky
start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down
by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his
downfield speed.

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets
will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but
he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible
offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting
Davis this week warrants consideration. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18
passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't
even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a
decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers
in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can
be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first
interception of the year.

Walter Rasby, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen
Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at
this point. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary
on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in
larger leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets
secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your
starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to
ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the
questionable N.Y. Jets secondary. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this
season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more
reliable tight end on your roster. 

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Canidate will replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this
weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense
and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a
a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York
Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the
majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid
will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the
more productive of the two backs. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth
starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and
around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/18/01
Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this
season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit
suspect at this point. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial
collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley
will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for
Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on
Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and
should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Thrash has been somewhat of a bust thus far, and isn't worth starting on a
consistent basis Fantasy-wise. As a result, don't play the Eagles' wideout
unless he proves that he can be more reliable. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Dayne has emerged as New York's main threat in the backfield, and has been
relatively productive in the role. Even with Tiki Barber back in the mix,
we expect Dayne to get the majority of the carries in the game. He'll have
a tough time running on the Eagles' defense, however, be he's still worth
starting in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Barber (hamstring) is listed as probable for Monday's game against
Philadelphia. He'll be used in the same capacity he was prior to the
injury, splitting time with Ron Dayne. We'd avoid using Barber if possible
as a result, especially in smaller leagues. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Richardson (shoulder) has returned to practice, and is expected to play
against Arizona. He might take away some carries from Priest Holmes, but
Holmes has clearly become Kansas City's top ground option.

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Collins has been mediocre at best this season, but his numbers against
Philadelphia were respectable in 2000. He's not the best option
Fantasy-wise, but you could do worse if you're desperate for a quarterback. 

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Minnis has been replaced in Kansas City's starting lineup by Chris Thomas.
The rookie wideout has been having trouble with his route running and
communication with QB Trent Green.

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
Hilliard will continue his role as the Giants' third receiver on Monday
against Philadelphia. His decreased playing time makes it tough to
recommend starting him, but don't be surprised if Hilliard finds the end
zone against the Eagles. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Toomer will face a tough matchup on Monday night, facing CB Bobby Taylor
and the aggressive Philadelphia secondary. He's worth starting in deeper
leagues, however, but you may want to sit him should you have the advantage
of a deep group of wideouts. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Williams is silencing his critics this season and has established himself
as a top Fantasy back. He's a must-start every week Fantasy-wise,
especially against lesser defenses like Atlanta. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
This could be the week that Brooks breaks out of his semi-slump. Brooks
will be facing an Atlanta defense that is dead last in the league against
the pass, so the matchup is certainly in his favor. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Pathon (foot) did not practice on Wednesday. He is not expected to play
against New England, and Reggie Wayne will probably start in his place for
the second consecutive week. He may not return until Nov. 4.

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Horn is a must-start this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons' secondary
is very vulnerable, so Horn should have no trouble putting up solid Fantasy
numbers. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Jackson had a down week against Carolina, but don't be surprised to see him
bounce back against Atlanta. The Falcons' secondary is one of the league's
worst, and is easily vulnerable to a big game. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Biakabutuka will be Carolina's starting tailback this weekend against
Washington. Based on the matchup, Biakabutuka is well worth starting
Fantasy-wise against a horrible Redskins' run defense. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
If Muhsin Muhammad is still being hindered by his rib injury, Hayes could
be in line for a big game against Washington. In any event, Hayes is worth
starting in deeper leagues based on the matchup.

Latest NFL Player News

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/27/01
McNair missed practice Wednesday because of back pain. ""I'm going to try to
do some things tomorrow and hope it loosens up and not have as much pain as
I had today,"" McNair said. ""I'm not going to go out and try to force the
issue. If it's still sore and still tight where I can't have all my
mechanics right, I'm not going to force the issue."" The Titans listed him
as questionable yet again Wednesday, but McNair likely will play 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 12/27/01
Bettis is still listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the
Cincinnati Bengals after missing Pittsburgh's last three games with a groin
injury. He skipped Wednesday's practice, as he has done most of the season,
even when healthy. ""I can't really predict the future, so I take it day by
day,"" Bettis said. ""I'm not 100 percent yet. I just want to keep improving
and take it day by day."" 

Martin Gramatica, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Gramatica sat out practice Wednesday, but is expected to test his injured
leg on Thursday. Doug Brien and Brad Daluiso worked out Wednesday for the
Buccaneers, who might sign one if Martin Gramatica can't kick against the
Baltimore Ravens this week. 

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/26/01
Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose separated
left shoulder is too sore for him to play. Coach Mike Holmgren said
Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the
third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday. ""There's
a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation,
but he's pretty sore,"" Holmgren said. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/26/01
Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His status for this week's
game is unclear. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 12/26/01
Graham may miss his second consecutive game this week because of the death
of his father. With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have
to start again. 

Skip Hicks, RB TEN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/26/01
Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may
miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular workload
once again. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 12/26/01
Smith is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 12/26/01
Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He
has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him
at this point of the postseason. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/26/01
Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains
unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if
needed. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/26/01
Walls is day to day with a knee injury. He should be able to play this
week. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Muhammad is still battling a turf toe injury. His status for Week 16 is
still unclear. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 12/26/01
Parker's season is over. He will undergo surgery on his shoulder and the
Chiefs are expected to place him on injured reserve. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/26/01
Gadsden (hamstring) might miss his second consecutive game this week. Chris
Chambers may start in his place again. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 12/26/01
Taylor (groin) has returned to practices and is working with the scout
team. He might appear in the team's final game, and is a longshot to play
this week. He has missed too much playing time to warrant serious Fantasy
consideration at this point of the playoffs. 

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 12/26/01
Smith (ankles) has returned to practice. He is expected to play this week. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/26/01
Ismail is recovering from a mild concussion. He is expected to play this
week. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 12/26/01
Galloway is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/26/01
Emanuel is day to day with an ankle injury. His status for the upcoming
week is unclear right now. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 12/26/01
McKnight is day to day with an ankle injury. He is expected to play this
week. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 12/26/01
Brunell is day to day with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to play this
week. 

Mike McMahon, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
McMahon may miss some practice time this week with a foot injury. His
status for this week's game is unclear right now, and Ty Detmer will start
in his place if he can't play. 

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Brookins may be able to return for Baltimore's final game. For now, Terry
Allen and Moe Williams will continue to split carries. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 12/25/01
Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may be able to
return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Bettis is
progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/23/01
Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He
was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not
return. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 12/23/01
Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play
again this season. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He
was replaced by Dorsey Levens. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/23/01
Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the
first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/23/01
Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he
left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. 

Martin Gramatica, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. The
Buccaneers may sign a free agent kicker to replace him in Week 16.

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/23/01
Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to
start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of
his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham
doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be
signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3
receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has
been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to
Fantasy glory. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/23/01
McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He
played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be
a solid No. 1 QB.

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/23/01
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's
game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with
extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not
be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No.
1 Fantasy QB. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He
left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the
game.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a
hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.

Fred Beasley, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of
the regular season. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a
must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't
depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in
place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help
Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the
weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you
need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.
Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player
on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best
wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him
during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be
a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper
league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too
talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead
your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start
during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2
wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during
the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2
during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not
accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid
Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2
wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the
NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not
in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into
your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider
him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch
a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be
a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless
your team is very thin at wide receiver. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless
you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't
recommended. 

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a
reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best
during your playoffs. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his
yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD
reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your
playoffs.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be
very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Coles has been New York's best receiver this year. He will continue to be a
consistent TD threat during the Fantasy postseason. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Miller has been inconsistent this season. Starting Miller is too huge a
gamble in the Fantasy playoffs. 

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Martin will be a key player in many Fantasy championship drives. Keep him
in your lineup throughout the rest of the season. 

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Booker has been one of the better receivers in the NFC. Look for him to
produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. 

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Chambers may start this week because Oronde Gadsden will be less than 100
percent healthy with a hamstring injury. He will continue to be a regular
TD threat during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Pittman has been inconsistent as a Fantasy player. Don't rely on him too
much during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 12/21/01
Plummer has played well this season. He should be an adequate QB during the
Fantasy playoffs. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Williams (ribs) is now listed as probable. He has been practicing with no
apparent problems. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
According to the <i>Pro Football News and Injury Report</i>, Davis' status
for Sunday's game is questionable right now. He has told reporters he will
play, but Ki-Jana Carter will start in his place if Davis can't play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hakim has a sore back. He is expected to play against Carolina. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Faulk has a minor knee problem. He is listed as probable for this week's
game. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Bruce (foot) missed Thursday's practice. He is listed as probable for this
week. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Owens (hip) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Garcia (ribs) returned to practice on Thursday. ""We didn't do too much with
him but just enough to make him feel somewhat confident about making
progress this week. The important thing will be how he feels tomorrow, does
he become real sore,"" Steve Mariucci told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""I
didn't notice any wincing. I didn't see any grimacing. I saw him throw a
couple of frozen ropes."" Garcia is expected to play this week. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Bouman worked on a limited basis in practice on Thursday. There is a chance
Spergon Wynn may start in his place this week, and that decision may be
made on Friday. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Parker may miss this week's game with a shoulder injury. He has not been a
reliable Fantasy player this year when healthy. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Holmes returned to practice on Thursday. He should assume his regular
workload this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Franks (ankle) has returned to practice. He is expected to play on Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Gadsden (hamstring) has returned to practice, but Chris Chambers may start
over him this week. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Muhammad (toe) did not practice on Thursday. He might miss the game against
Buffalo, and Isaac Byrd will start in his place if Muhammad can't play. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Walls (ankle) practiced on Thursday. He might be able to play against
Buffalo. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Price (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Wycheck started off slow this season but has been productive in recent
weeks. Expect him to contribute a fair amount of points during the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Christian missed practice with tightness in his calf on Thursday. His
current status is day to day. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
George is listed as questionable for Saturday's game because of an ankle
injury, but is expected to play. Look for him to be productive this week
against a weak Raider run defense. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Look for Dyson to be a decent No. 2 receiver during the Fantasy postseason.
He might not score, but he should catch a few passes. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Mason is expected to play Saturday, despite suffering from a hip injury.
Look for him to be an adequate No. 2 wideout. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Ward hasn't scored a lot of touchdowns this season but is among the league
leaders in receptions. He should be an asset to your team for the rest of
the season as a No. 2 wideout. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Burress has been more reliable in recent weeks but still remains a risky
pick for the Fantasy playoffs. He will only be a good No. 2 wideout at
best. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect
him to be too productive during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Mack has produced an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't
scored a lot. He should be used in larger leagues only for the remaining
weeks. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
McCardell has caught a lot of passes this season but he doesn't score too
many touchdowns. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 receiver in the Fantasy
playoffs.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Luccis Losers Player News

James McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 12/26/01
McKnight is day to day with an ankle injury. He is expected to play this
week. 

Larry Parker, Reserve WR Updated 12/26/01
Parker's season is over. He will undergo surgery on his shoulder and the
Chiefs are expected to place him on injured reserve. 

Cameron Cleeland, Reserve TE Updated 12/23/01
Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play
again this season. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, Reserve WR Updated 12/21/01
Hakim has a sore back. He is expected to play against Carolina. 

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in
place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help
Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Kurt Warner, Active QB Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.
Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 12/21/01
Booker has been one of the better receivers in the NFC. Look for him to
produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. 

Duce Staley, Active RB Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into
your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Ike Hilliard, Reserve WR Updated 12/20/01
The <I>New York Daily News</i> says the pain in Hilliard's toe has
worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play
against Seattle. 

Alex Van Pelt, Reserve QB Updated 12/16/01
The Patriots limited Van Pelt to 219 passing yards, no TDs and one
interception. Right now, the Buffalo QB is not playing well enough to start
for any Fantasy team. 

Charlie Garner, Active RB Updated 12/16/01
Garner had 113 scrimmage yards against San Diego on Saturday. He was held
out of the end zone for the third straight week, however, and has only
scored two touchdowns the entire season. 

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 12/16/01
The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the veteran
receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during any
week of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Mike Alstott, Active RB Updated 12/09/01
Alstott rushed for 66 yards and a TD and caught four passes for 34 yards
against Detroit. The Tampa Bay fullback will be a regular scoring threat
during the Fantasy postseason.

Ravens, Active DT Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after
undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of
the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage
than usual. 

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee.

about anyone. It is all completely legal, and you can use it in the privacy
of your own home without anyone ever knowing. It's cheaper and faster than
hiring a private investigator.

What does the T stand for?  PT...reminds me of the circus, are you really 
that much fun?  My ""boy toy"" is standing me up tonight, can you believe it?  
Oh...the agony!  Besides the afro, what else have you picked up for your 
costume?  You need to rent some white tuxedo shoes and a white belt to go 
with your orange or light blue, polyester bell bottoms.  (these MUST fit 
quite snug)  Not to mention a very hip large collar disco shirt.  The girls 
will be squealing with delight.

I'm very happy that we will continue to become better friends and I can't 
wait to spend some time with you again.  So incredibley cool that we agree 
on the same ground rules.  I'm sending big wet kisses your way...LOOK OUT! -

We received notification that the 5th segment to gate valve 6 providing a
total firm capacity of 495 Mdth/day was approved by FERC today.  Based on

on a Friday afternoon, the contracts will be effective on Monday, October
29, but the capacity will be available tomorrow and Sunday.  We filed the
6th segment to gate valve 5 this past Tuesday (October 23) and are prepared
to file the final segment as soon as one currently being reviewed is
approved.

Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/09/01
Pathon is expected to miss Sunday's game because of a sprained foot. He
suffered the injury in Indianapolis' previous game against the Patriots.
Terrence Wilkins or Reggie Wayne will start in his place. Consider
reserving Pathon this week. 

Ty Detmer, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Detmer was benched on Monday night after another poor outing. He was
replaced by Charlie Batch and may have lost his starting QB spot. In any
event, neither signal-caller has much Fantasy value.

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/09/01
Barlow is still being hampered by a quadriceps injury, but will continue to
play despite the ailment. ""It happened, what, two months ago? And it
probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to work through it,""
Barlow told the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I>. ""People don't know how bad
this is hurting."" The injury could hamper Barlow's playing time in the
future, so be cautious when starting him Fantasy-wise. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/09/01
Stokes, who injured his knee during Sunday's win over Carolina, is listed
as probable for this weekend's contest at Atlanta. He's been inconsistent
thus far, and shouldn't be depended on to produce Fantasy-wise. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/09/01
According to Head Coach Andy Reid, Staley's shoulder injury will not cost
him the starting RB spot. However, he did say that Staley will be eased
back into the role after the team's bye week, so expect Correll Buckhalter
to see the majority of the carries when Philly plays the N.Y. Giants on
October 22. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/09/01
Franks suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's loss to Tampa Bay. The
injury isn't considered serious, however, and Franks is expected to start
this weekend against Baltimore. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Ismail (knee) will work into drills this week, which means that there is a
possibility that he will return for Monday's game against Washington. Even
if he does return, he's not worth starting for a Fantasy perspective. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Harris, who has been struggling with a groin injury, is expected to
participate in drills this week. He'll likely be available for Monday's
game against Washington, barring any setbacks. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/09/01
With Quincy Carter out for two weeks, Wright will be Dallas' starting QB
for at least next week's game. You may actually want to consider starting
Wright this week against Washington, but you'd have to be pretty desperate. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Carter is expected to miss two weeks due to a hamstring injury. Anthony
Wright will start in Carter's place, but neither QB has much Fantasy value
at this point. 

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Baxter (hip), who was inactive for Sunday's game against Atlanta, could be
out for this weekend's game as well. The veteran tight end has very little
value as a Fantasy player at this point, so the injury won't make a huge
impact. 

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 10/09/01
Allen will remain the Bears' No. 1 tailback, at least for the moment.
Rookie Anthony Thomas will see an increase in playing time, however, so
Allen's Fantasy value will likely take a hit. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/09/01
According to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>, Thomas will not take over the
starting RB spot in Chicago, at least not yet. Head Coach Dick Jaroun will
stick with current No. 1 tailback James Allen for the time being, but
Thomas will see an increase in playing time and is worth picking up
Fantasy-wise. 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Defensive end Bruce Smith, who was knocked out of Sunday's game against the
Giants with a dislocated right shoulder, will miss two to three weeks while
the tissue in his right shoulder heals and he regains his strength and
range of motion. You shouldn't be using the Redskins' defense on a weekly
basis in a Fantasy league to begin with.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01
Johnson suffered a shoulder contusion when it was driven into the ground
during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay. He should be
fine for Week Five, but see how he fares in practice before making a
decision on starting him next week.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
The Giants said that Barber should be able to return from a hamstring
injury next Sunday in St. Louis. However, it is unclear whether he will get
the majority of the carries over Ron Dayne, so be careful starting either
unless the Giants' RB picture clears up by then.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Dayne left Sunday's game against Washington with a neck stinger, an injury
which the Giants said was not serious. He should be able to play next
Sunday in St. Louis.

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/08/01
Bradford left Sunday's game in Tampa Bay with cramps after returning a
kickoff. He will be re-evaluated on Monday.

Ryan Leaf, QB TB - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
The Cowboys remain interest in Leaf despite ligament damage in his wrist,
according to the <I>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</I>. They may sign him to the
roster and place him on injured reserve. Leaf offers no Fantasy value at
this stage of his career.

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Carter said the next 48 hours would determine whether he will be able to
play a week from Monday against Washington, according to <I>The Dallas
Morning News</I>. He has a strained left hamstring that he said he felt pop
during the first quarter of Sunday's game. Carter isn't a recommended
Fantasy starter even when healthy.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Hasselbeck (groin) missed Seattle's win over Jacksonville and watched Trent
Dilfer lead the team to 24 points. Still, Mike Holmgren claimed the injured
Hasselbeck will remain Seattle's starter. ""I said it before and I'll say it
again,"" Holmgren told the <i>Seattle Times</i>. ""Matt Hasselbeck is our
quarterback."" Hasselbeck's status for Seattle's next game is unclear.

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/08/01
Coles sprained his ankle at Buffalo. The injury is not considered to be
serious.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Luccis Losers Updated 10/08/01
Glenn is eligible to start practicing, but the Patriots have applied for a
roster exemption so he can get into playing shape. Don't expect him to be a
solid contributor to the New England passing game in the near future. When
he will make his return to the lineup is still unclear.

Ray Lucas, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Lucas appeared in short-yardage sets on Sunday. He still won't play often
enough to affect Jay Fiedler's numbers.

Kevin Kasper, WR DEN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Kasper suffered a severely sprained right ankle on Sunday and will miss
three to six weeks. Travis McGriff or Chris Cole might see more time in the
passing game while Kasper is out.

Rickey Dudley, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Dudley played with a sprained foot on Sunday. He is not expected to miss
any playing time.

Patrick Johnson, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Johnson is expected to miss eight weeks with a clavicle injury. He had
already started to fall behind the emerging Travis Taylor as a preferred
target in the passing game.

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/08/01
Weinke was extremely ineffective against the Niners Sunday. He completed
only 29 of 47 passes for 275 yards. Three of his incompletions resulted in
interceptions while he threw only one touchdown pass. Weinke was effective
in the season opener but has proven to be a Fantasy reserve at best. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Walls proved to be quarterback Chris Weinke's best target Sunday against
the 49ers catching 10 passes for 91 yards and a score. Walls won't do this
every week but he will get a lot of looks from Weinke when he can't find
his receivers. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Owens was productive once again on Sunday, catching eight passes for 118
yards and two scores. Look for him to do well next week against Atlanta. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01
Hearst did not score but provided decent production Sunday against the
Panthers gaining 74 yards on 18 carries. He is not starter material at this
point but will be a good backup in most Fantasy leagues. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Garcia was solid once again in Sunday's game against the Panthers. He threw
for 212 yards and two touchdown passes against only one interception. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01
Brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance Sunday. He
only threw for 210 yards with an interception and no touchdown passes.
Brooks has struggled in the last two games but the Saints will stick with
him as the starter since they are winning games. 

Michael Vick, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01
Vick was an adequate replacement for the injured Chris Chandler but he
failed to lead the Falcons to the end zone. He completed 12 of 18 passes
for 186 yards and also gained 23 yards on four carries. Look for Vick to
return to the bench next week. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Jeffers (knees) missed Sunday's game against San Francisco. He continues to
make progress in his recovery from multiple knee surgeries, but isn't ready
to return to action just yet. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01
Barlow recently revealed that he is playing with a quadriceps injury that
has hampered his ability since training camp. ""It happened, what, two
months ago? And it probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to
work through it,"" Barlow told <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>. ""People
don't know how bad this is hurting."" Barlow will continue to play but the
injury might prevent him from taking over as the full-time running back.
Keep him on your bench for now. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Jefferson missed most of the second half of Sunday's game due to neck and
back injuries. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Receivers Terance
Mathis, Brian Finneran and Quentin McCord will be the wideouts next week if
he is inactive. 

Nick Goings, RB CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Goings was inactive for Sunday's game as Tim Biakabutuka resumed his job as
the starting running back. Keep Goings on your bench for now. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Biakabutuka started Sunday's game after being benched a week earlier. He
wasn't too effective gaining 45 yards on 10 rushes. Biakabutuka also caught
two passes for 22 yards. Keep Biakabutuka on your bench if you have depth
at running back. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01
Chandler left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury was
diagnosed as a Grade 1 concussion, the least severe on the scale. He is
listed as day to day. Michael Vick will start next Sunday if he is unable
to play. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/08/01
Stokes sprained his knee in Sunday's game, but stayed in the contest. He
will be evaluated on a daily basis. Stokes had just one catch in the game
for six yards. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Coles caught five passes for 77 yards and carried the ball two times for 15
yards at Buffalo. Coles has apparently become an important part of the New
York offense in his second pro season.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Becht caught three passes for 21 yards and a TD at Buffalo. Despite some
early struggles, Becht still appears to be an key member of the New York
passing game on third downs and near the goal line.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Price caught four passes for 103 yards and a TD against the Jets. Don't
expect big numbers from Price again in the near future. He very rarely
breaks loose for a big play. The 70-yard TD pass he caught in Week Four is
not one of his usual feats.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/07/01
Henry rushed for 113 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Against
low-quality defenses that appear on the schedule, Henry should continue to
be a good Fantasy option. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
McCardell caught seven passes for 97 yards at Seattle. The veteran wideout
looks to be in good health again, and should be a solid Fantasy starter for
the rest of the year.

Itula Mili, TE SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Mili caught two passes for 42 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. Mili is
quick, and has good hands. He is worth a look if you need help at the tight
end position.

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Alexander rushed for 176 yards on 31 carries and scored two TDs against
Jacksonville. He will continue to be a good Fantasy starter while Ricky
Watters is out, and Alexander seems to be more of a TD threat than Watters
can be right now.

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Mack was benched at Seattle on Sunday in the second quarter after rushing
for only 17 yards on eight carries. On his final attempt of the day, he
lost a fumble, and was replaced by rookie Elvis Joseph. The first-year back
rushed for only 39 yards and fumbled as well, but he caught an 18-yard TD
pass. Now there will be major questions as to who will start the next game
at RB for the Jaguars if Fred Taylor is not ready to return from a groin
injury after the bye week.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Wheatley scored two TDs against Dallas on Sunday. His rushing totals (33
yards) were modest, however, and it's still tough to start him on a weekly
basis due to the presence of Charlie Garner. 

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Brown caught seven passes for 114 yards in Oakland's win over Dallas. He
continues to be one of the more consistent receivers in the league from a
Fantasy perspective. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/07/01
Dallas tried to open up their offense against Oakland, and Galloway's
numbers improved slightly as a result. He had his best game of the season,
posting 59 yards receiving and a TD. Those are modest numbers, however, so
don't think of starting him on a weekly basis. 

Aaron Stecker, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/07/01
Stecker rushed for only six yards on two carries against Green Bay. He does
not appear to be a viable option for the Buccaneers while Warrick Dunn is
out. Tampa Bay apparently still has faith in Mike Alstott.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Smith was held in check once again, posting only 46 yards of total offense
against Oakland. Without an effective passing game, Smith is going to have
a long season. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Wright took over at QB for Dallas after Quincy Carter left in the first
quarter with a strained hamstring. He completed 14-of-22 for 126 yards and
two TDs against Oakland, but still has very little value as a Fantasy
player. 

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/07/01
Alstott rushed for 77 yards on 15 carries and a TD against the Packers. The
big fullback proved he can still be a dependable Fantasy RB.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Wycheck left Sunday's game against Baltimore with a neck strain. He did not
return to the game, and will be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Freeman caught only one pass for six yards at Tampa Bay. With the emergence
of Bill Schroeder, Freeman has become the less desirable option of Green
Bay's starting wideouts.

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Gary carried the ball only nine times for 28 yards in Denver's 20-6 win
over Kansas City. He may have slipped to No. 2 on the depth chart behind
Mike Anderson. 

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Anderson posted 155 yards rushing and a score against Kansas City on
Sunday. He received much more of the workload in the Denver backfield than
Olandis Gary, and may be emerging as the team's No. 1 back. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/07/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 119 yards and a TD at Tampa Bay. The Green
Bay wideout performed well against a very tough defense, proving he has
indeed become a quality Fantasy player.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Smith had another huge outing, posting eight receptions for 110 yards and a
score against Kansas City. Smith is establishing himself as one of the best
wideouts in the league this season, and should be in your starting lineup
on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Griese struggled for the second consecutive week, posting only 121 yards
passing and a TD against Kansas City. Griese's numbers are being hurt
somewhat by the loss of Ed McCaffrey, but he still warrants a weekly
starting spot in most leagues Fantasy-wise.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Holmes put up decent numbers against Denver, posting seven receptions and
100 yards of total offense. He's not worthy of a starting spot every week,
but he could be useful when the matchup is right. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Green came back to earth after a solid performance last weekend against
Washington. Green was picked off four times by the Denver defense and was
held without a TD pass in the Chiefs' 20-6 loss. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/07/01
Johnson left Sunday's game vs. Green Bay for a brief period in the third
quarter with an apparent shoulder injury. He returned to the game after an
examination on the sidelines.

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/07/01
Smith rushed for 71 yards on 17 carries against the Bears. Smith lacks the
speed and burst to be a solid Fantasy RB for the rest of the year. Don't
count on him as anything more than a reserve, despite the respectable look
of his final Week Four numbers.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/07/01
Robinson caught nine passes for 114 yards and a TD against the Falcons.
Robinson has reclaimed his spot among Fantasy Football's top wideouts now
that he is healthy again.

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Jenkins caught six passes for 119 yards and a TD against the Eagles. Don't
expect such totals from Jenkins on a regular basis. He might draw more
defensive attention in the coming weeks, and has never proved he can put up
good numbers in the past.

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Pinkston caught four passes for 90 yards and two TDs against the Cardinals.
The young wideout has quickly emerged as a quality Fantasy player because
of his good hands, concentration and leaping ability.

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Buckhalter rushed for 134 yards on 21 carries against Arizona. The rookie
has put up fine yardage numbers in his pair of starts in place of the
injured Duce Staley.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Plummer threw for 238 yards, two TDs and an interception in a win over
Philadelphia. His respectable performance against the Eagles' strong
defense should convince many Fantasy owners to take a chance on him as a
backup.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/07/01
Fiedler threw for only 87 yards and a TD and was intercepted once by the
Patriots. Don't depend on Fiedler for quality Fantasy numbers on a weekly
basis.

James McKnight, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
McKnight caught two passes for just 17 yards against the Patriots. The
veteran wideout cannot be counted on for reliable Fantasy production.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Brown caught five passes for 47 yards at Miami. His numbers may suffer
until Drew Bledsoe is healthy again. Tom Brady does not have the arm
strength to take advantage of Brown's deep gears on a regular basis.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Minnis (concussion) was in the starting lineup for Kansas City on Sunday.
He was originally listed as questionable for the game, but was able to go.
The rookie posted five receptions for 56 yards in the game. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Smith rushed for 47 yards and a TD at Miami. While he may not post
consistently good yardage numbers the rest of the year, Smith will continue
to be a TD threat.

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/07/01
Johnson was taken to the locker room in the first half of Sunday's game
with a pinched nerve in his neck. He was replaced by Alex Van Pelt and did
not return.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Anderson has received most of the carries in the first half of Sunday's
game against Kansas City. In fact, he has already rushed for 106 yards and
a score midway through the first half. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Carter left Sunday's game against Oakland in the first quarter due to a
strained left hamstring. He did not return to the game, and will be
re-evaluared on Monday. Anthony Wright replaced the rookie QB in the lineup
for Dallas. 

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Taylor had his second consecutive good outing on Sunday, posting five
receptions and a touchdown in Baltimore's 26-7 victory over Tennessee. If
he continues to produce, Taylor may warrant a starting role from a Fantasy
perspective on a more regular basis. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/07/01
Warrick caught four passes for just 39 yards against the Steelers. Jon
Kitna has been working more exclusively with Darnay Scott, and Warrick
hasn't put up good Fantasy numbers yet this season.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Brookins saw an increase in his carries on Sunday against Tennessee, and
his numbers really reflected it. He posted 68 yards and a touchdown in
Baltimore's 26-7 victory, and could see more playing time in the Ravens'
offense from now on. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/07/01
Ward caught eight passes 68 yards against the Bengals. He continues to be
Pittsburgh's only reliable wide receiver, and now qualifies as a solid
Fantasy reserve.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/07/01
Allen finally had a productive game, posting 108 yards rushing and a
touchdown against Tennessee. However, he still isn't a player that Fantasy
owners should depend on for consistent production. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Kinney had a solid game against Baltimore, posting seven catches for 75
yards. He is putting a dent into Frank Wycheck's numbers early in the year,
and will likely play a more prominent role in the Titans' offense this
season. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Bettis rushed for 153 yards on 24 carries against Cincinnati. He will
continue to stack up good numbers from a yardage perspective, but the
Pittsburgh offense is not giving him enough scoring opportunities.

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Despite a slight shoulder injury, Williams was impressive on Sunday against
Minnesota. He posted 178 yards of total offense and a touchdown in the
Saints' 28-15 win. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/07/01
Jackson led New Orleans with six catches for 95 yards against Minnesota on
Sunday. He has become QB Aaron Brooks' favorite target and is slowly
becoming a more consistent Fantasy player. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Bennett was held in check once again, posting only 36 yards of total
offense against New Orleans. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may
want to consider dropping Bennett altogether. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/07/01
Brunell started Sunday's game at Seattle. He had been listed as
questionable with recurring headaches.

Damon Washington, RB NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Washington was impressive after replacing the injured Ron Dayne on Sunday,
posting 106 scrimmage yards against the Redskins. He did fumbled twice,
however, and probably won't get the opportunity to see extensive playing
time again unless both Dayne and Tiki Barber are unable to go next week. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/07/01
Chandler sustained a mild concussion in the second quarter of Sunday's game
against the Chicago Bears. Michael Vick played the entire second half at QB
for Atlanta.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Davis had another rough outing, posting just 39 yards rushing on Sunday
against the N.Y. Giants. With Washington's offense struggling, Fantasy
owners may want to consider dealing Davis within the next few weeks. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Banks was horrible against the N.Y. Giants, completing 13-of-31 for only
151 yards and two interceptions. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a
roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Patrick Johnson, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Johnson fractured his clavicle during Sunday's game against Tennessee. He
will likely miss a few weeks of action due to the injury. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Jackson (ribs) was in the starting lineup for Cleveland on Sunday. He
rushed for 68 yards and a touchdown in the Browns' 20-16 victory over San
Diego. 

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Tomlinson had another huge game, rushing for 102 yards and a touchdown
against Cleveland. The rookie from TCU is quickly becoming one of the best
RBs in the entire league, and is worthy of a starting spot on your Fantasy
team on weekly basis. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
George left Sunday's game against Baltimore in the second half due an ankle
injury. He was replaced in the backfield by Mike Green. George did not
return to the game, but he was seen testing the ankle on the sidelines and
will likely be available for next week's game against Tampa Bay. 

Michael Vick, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Vick opened the second half at QB for Atlanta. Chris Chandler left the game
against Chicago with a concussion.

"CBS SPORTSLINE.COM FANTASY FOOTBALL NEWSLETTER","<!--
Please use the web site's ""Contact Us"" link, located at the
bottom of every page, for any inquiries.


Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football 
Newsletter! The newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox 
at the end of every week, and will include news about the 
web site; tips on using all the features available; and 
answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron 
Guru."" 


PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS

The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are
on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin
with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, 
with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)

If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, 
Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds 
they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not 
determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. 
The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding 
the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your 
regular season. 

If your team is still in contention, go to 
NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes 
during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be 
available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff 
matchup.


GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS

Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did
in each game this season. The player's statistics in the 
common categories will be displayed for each game. If you

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Mike Blake: I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. 
Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin 
Muhammad in week ten? 

G.G. - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston 
has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing 
playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from 
a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last 
weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success 
against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with 
Muhammad. 

Russell Brown: My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one 
of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, 
Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.   

G.G. - Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this 
season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie 
struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and 
won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest 
playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the 
return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in 
his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. 

Chris Gilcrest: Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich 
Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would 
you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, 
Curtis Martin?  

G.G. - Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but 
he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like 
Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar 
performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a 
solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike 
Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the 
matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three 
games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his 
struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit 
is too good to ignore.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay 
healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his 
solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to 
another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best 
Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an 
unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

Plan for the Playoffs
</font></b><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2""> 
<!-- First tip text goes here -->
The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are
on the horizon. For <b>Fantasy 2001</b> players, the playoffs begin
with NFL week 15 (games of <b>Dec. 22-23</b>) and last two weeks,
with the championship game in week 16 (games of <b>Dec. 29-30</b>.)<p>

If you're in a <b>Football Commissioner</b> league, go to <b><i>Schedule,
Playoffs</i></b> to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds
they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not
determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets.
The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding
the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your
regular season.<p>

If your team is still in contention, go to
<b><i>NFL Teams, Schedule</i></b> and take note of the NFL teams with byes
during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be
available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff
matchup.

"Medicine Bow Tie-In Capacity","Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

Based on your concerns and requests for additional notice prior to
commissioning each additional segment, we are adopting the following
procedure for placing segments in service:

We will notify you when we have filed each segment with FERC for approval.
Based on our experience with the tie-ins to date, we are now anticipating 4
days for approval.  Upon receiving FERC approval, we will notify you of the
contract in service date for that segment of capacity. The contract will
start at the later of the following dates:  1) two days following the date
of FERC approval; 2) 4 days following filing with FERC; or 3) at least one
week following the last in service date.

For example, we officially filed for the second segment approval (61
Mdth/day) September 25 (today) and anticipate filing the next segment (79
Mdth/day) on October 1.  If we receive FERC approval tomorrow, we will
notify you, but the contract will not become effective until Sept 29.
However, you would have additional capacity available a couple days early at
$.1434.

Hopefully, the above procedure will help you to plan for your nominations by
providing more flexability and notice for each additional commissioning.
Please call me to discuss or with any questions.

Crude Oil Futures Continue to Rally

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX rose $0.20 
to $19.80 per barrel yesterday, rallying almost $2.00 over the past 3 
sessions. Colder weather in the Northeast and an expected production 
cut by the worlds largest oil producers combined to lift crude oil 
prices. The EIA and API both reported a decrease in inventories last 
week. However stockpiles of oil and products are still near 2-year 
highs after the September 11th tragedy plunged the US into a 
recession that sharply lowered petroleum demand. EIA data shows that 
distillate demand is 6.5% lower than a year ago. Meanwhile, the API 
says that total US oil demand in November dipped to the lowest level 
for the month in 3 years. The onset of winter weather in the 
Northeast helped to lower distillate stocks by 1.6 million barrels 
last week, for only the 2nd time since late September. US refiners 
have been shipping excess heating oil to Europe and cutting back 
refinery operations, which lowered surplus of refined products. The 
prospect that OPEC and non-cartel members would trim about 2 million 
bpd in exports also provided support for the market. Although a final 
decision on the amount of the production cut will not be made until 
the ministers meet on December 28th in Cairo. Heating oil futures for 
January delivery on the NYMEX climbed $0.0144 to $0.5613 per gallon. 
January gasoline futures on the NYMEX gained $0.0077 to $0.5581 per 
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for February delivery on 
the IPE were up $0.29 to $19.47 per barrel.

Venezuela Seeks LNG Deal

    Venezuela hopes to sign a 4 million tonne per year LNG deal with 
a joint venture by Exxon Mobil, Shell, Mitsubishi and state-owned 
Petroleos de Venezuela, which was formed to capitalize on growing 
demand from the Atlantic Basin. The countrys 1st LNG exports could 
occur within the next 6 years if the project moves forward quickly 
enough. Venezuela has tried for over a decade to make a deal to 
export natural gas from its offshore Paria region near Trinidad. The 
Venezuelan project has languished because of rapidly growing LNG 
exports from countries such as Trinidad and Nigeria. Some say 
predictions of rising demand in Europe and US has given Venezuelan 
LNG exports a small window of opportunity. However, if Venezuela 
latches on to a partner with power generation capabilities, it would 
create an integrated project with a guaranteed market. The South 
American nation is also considering building a large industrial hub 
near Guiria to  link natural gas from the offshore Paria and nearby 
Deltana areas to a LNG plant, from which it could travel west for 
domestic use and fuel proposed petrochemical and chemical plants.

Husky's White Rose Oil Project Gains Governmental Approval
  
    Husky Energy has gained governmental approval for the $1.5 
billion White Rose oil field off Newfoundland, making it the 
province's 3rd major offshore project. Husky said it would review 38 
conditions attached to the approval before making its own decision to 
proceed, probably within 3 months. The company is the operator and 
owns 72.5% of the 230 million barrel project, which is about 220 
miles east of  St. John's. Petro-Canada owns the remaining share of 
White Rose. If the companies decide to proceed, production would 
begin in late 2004. Output is expected to climb to 100,000 bpd. 
Current plans call for the field to be developed using a floating 
production, storage and offloading vessel. The project would follow 
the nearby Hibernia project, which began operation in 1997, and Terra 
Nova, scheduled to start soon following delays and cost overruns. As 
part of the 38 conditions, Husky must provide a more complete 
analysis of oil and natural gas reserves in sections of White Rose by 
2007. The floating production, storage and offloading vessel must 
also allow room for a possible natural gas processing plant, because 
the field contains major reserves of natural gas which are not part 
of the current development plan, regulators said. Husky estimates the 
natural gas reserves at 2 Tcf, while the Canada-Newfoundland Offshore 
Petroleum Board puts the number at 3.1 Tcf.

JP Morgan Acknowledges Greater Secured Enron Exposure

    JP Morgan Chase says its stake in Enron that is secured by assets 
is $965 million, or more than twice the amount it previously 
disclosed. JP Morgan has filed lawsuits against several top insurance 
companies that issued contracts, or surety bonds, guaranteeing Enron 
assets. It has sued insurers including: Chubb Corp, CNA Financial and 
Citigroups Travelers Property Casualty unit. JP Morgan has also 
acknowledged about $600 million in unsecured exposure to Enron. The 
surety bonds at the heart of JP Morgan Chase's lawsuits against its 
insurers were issued to guarantee obligations of Enron North America 
and Enron Natural Gas Marketing under prepaid forward natural gas and 
crude oil contracts. In addition, JP Morgan says a European financial 
institution has failed to pay it on a $165 million letter of credit 
backing an Enron-related swap contract.

Canadian Natural Delays Heavy Oil Production

    Canadian Natural Resources has said that low oil prices for heavy 
crude have led it to cut production and delay drilling. The company, 
which has operations in Canada, the North Sea and west Africa, said 
it had cut Alberta heavy oil production this month by 15,000 bpd, and 
that the cut would remain in place until prices improve. The company 
said that the reduction of the high cost heavy crude represents about 
4% of its current overall oil and natural gas production of 365,000 
bpd of oil equivalent. Canadian Natural will fund drilling in only 20 
heavy oil wells next year, compared with 91 this year. The slumping 
petroleum market has also led to the postponement of its Primrose, 
Alberta SAGD project until next spring. SAGD is a process which pumps 
steam into the earth to heat up the crude, allowing it to flow to the 
surface. Canadian heavy crude carries a big discount because it 
requires an extensive refining process to turn it into gasoline and 
other petroleum products. The company said if prices improve by the 
end of the first quarter, it will bring much of the idle production 
back on-line quickly. In the meantime, Canadian Natural has completed 
a 35 mile extension to its 95 mile ECHO heavy oil pipeline in 
Alberta, providing access to transportation for some of its 
production properties. The line, which transports heated heavy oil, 
allows the company to ship 57,000 bpd to an interconnection with an 
Enbridge pipeline to the Midwest and an Alberta Energy Express line 
to the Rocky Mountain region.

Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Reidel Anthony <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1860&> , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Anthony practiced Wednesday despite a left shoulder contusion, and he is expected to play Sunday at Tennessee. However, he hasn't been a main receiving threat for the Bucs this season, so don't use him in a Fantasy league. 

Dave Moore <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Moore missed Wednesday's practice with a right ankle sprain, but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Tennessee. He hasn't proven a reliable Fantasy tight end thus far, so don't use him this week. 

Jacquez Green <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=12405&>, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/11/01
Green did not practice Wednesday due to an injured left groin, but he is expected to play Sunday in Tennessee. We don't recommend you use him against the tough Titans secondary this week.

Warrick Dunn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/11/01
Dunn participated in light running drills Wednesday and could practice Thursday or Friday, according to the St. Petersburg Times. Provided he has no problems with his sprained right foot, Dunn could play Sunday in Tennessee. We don't recommend you take your chances, and instead only use Dunn this week if he is clearly going to get the majority of the carries at running back. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1226&>, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/11/01
According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, talk out of Packers practice is that Freeman will get more passes thrown his way in the next few games. We're not convinced Brett Favre will stop throwing the majority of his passes to Bill Schroeder as long as Schroeder remains productive, but there's a good chance Freeman might yet be able to help Fantasy teams this season. Just don't start him against the stifling Ravens defense this week. 

Shawn Jefferson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Uran Man Updated 10/11/01
Jefferson is dealing with both neck and back injuries, but he has returned to practice this week. He lacks the consistency to help Fantasy leaguers on a regular basis, so avoid starting him if possible. 

Chris Chandler <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Chandler, who suffered a mild concussion last week, is expected to start this week for the Falcons. Michael Vick, however, still might appear in some short-yardage packages.

Patrick Jeffers <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01
Jeffers might finally return to the Carolina lineup this week. He is close to full speed, says the Charlotte Observer. ""He's still working his way into being ready,"" Seifert said. ""He's starting to capture my imagination."" 

Marcus Robinson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1676&>, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/11/01
Robinson participated sparingly in practice because his surgically-repaired back remains sore from playing on artificial turf last Sunday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times . He isn't on the Bears' injury report, and we think he'll have a solid Fantasy week. Feel free to use Robinson if he doesn't suffer a setback.

Shane Matthews <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
The Bears listed Matthews as questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona with a rib injury. He will serve as the No. 3 quarterback at best, so don't use him as a Fantasy starter right now. 

Fred Baxter <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1355&>, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Baxter is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona with a hip injury. He's a questionable Fantasy player to begin with.

Damon Washington <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=146364&>, RB NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Washington (shoulder sprain) practiced on Wednesday. As of now, it looks like he might be asked to start at halfback against the Rams. 

Ron Dayne <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01
Dayne (neck) did not practice on Wednesday. Right now, it does not appear that he will play against St. Louis.

Tiki Barber <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Barber did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for Sunday, and as of now, it does not appear he will play against the Rams. 

Frank Sanders <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01
Sanders did not practice on Wednesday because of a quadriceps injury. His current status is day to day.

Robert Thomas <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=134236&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Thomas suffered a lacerated finger during practice on Wednesday. However, the Dallas fullback is probable for Monday's game against Washington. Thomas has no real value as a Fantasy player. 

Saints <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=18&>, DT NO - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Defensive end Joe Johnson could miss Sunday's game against Carolina with a strained left quadriceps. He'll be listed as doubtful, but there is an outside chance that he'll play. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the Panthers this week, which makes them worth starting as a defense Fantasy-wise. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01
Hasselbeck (groin) has started taking the snaps with the first-team offense and is listed as probable on the Seahawks' injury report. Although no official decision has been announced, a healthy Hasselbeck would likely get the start over Trent Dilfer this week. 

Terrell Davis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/11/01
Davis returned to practice and worked with the scout team. He is making cuts without pain, and there is a chance he could return in early November. ""I'm not going to put a target date on it,"" Davis told the Denver Post. ""I'm just going to go through this week, evaluate it and see where I am at the end of this week, and we'll go from there. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1191&>, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
The Kansas City Star says the Chiefs are preparing to play Sunday's game without Alexander, who still has a back problem. ""It's not structurally damaged from a nerve standpoint, but they can definitely see why there is some soreness from the MRIs,"" Dick Vermeil said. ""He's just got to work through it."" Chris Thomas will probably start in Alexander's place. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=235256&>, WR IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/11/01
Wayne might be asked to make his first pro start this week. Jerome Pathon is expected to sit out with a foot injury, and Terrence Wilkins is questionable with a rib problem. Newly-signed Tony Simmons might work as the third receiver. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Wilkins is questionable for Sunday's game against Oakland with a rib injury. Jerome Pathon (foot) might also sit out, leaving Indianapolis thin at wideout against the Raiders.

Mike Vanderjagt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=12783&>, K IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Vanderjagt has not kicked since having a toenail removed last week. But he is expected to play against the Raiders on Sunday night.

Terry Glenn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Glenn has returned to practice. The Patriots are not sure when he will be ready to play, but might have a good indication of his progress by the weekend. 

John Hall <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1705&>, K NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Hall left practice with a back injury. His current status is day to day, although there are no plans for an MRI.

Derrick Mason <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1816&>, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Mason worked out in the beginning of practice Wednesday but his ankle was so sore that he had to stop. He is listed as questionable for this week's game. 

Eddie George <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/11/01
George did some light running, but did not practice Wednesday. ""Eddie was better by the end of practice. He is still sore,"" head coach Jeff Fisher told The Tennessean. ""He is doing more than what I thought he would do considering where he was after the game."" Fisher also added that George would be a game-time decision if he doesn't practice on Thursday or Friday. The Titans will use Skip Hicks and Mike Green in his place if George is inactive. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3736&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/11/01

Ok.....here's the deal. 

EVERYONE lost this week which means we all split 1st, 2nd and 3rd place
money. ($740 divided by 13)

We have a couple of options. 

1.  Receive $56.92 now.  (Maybe Bob W. will throw in the extra 8 cents for
everyone so we can round our winnings up to $57.00).  Game over.
2.  Let everything ride.  No coming back to collect later though!  This also
means that the pot of dollars will be smaller by the number of players
electing to take their winnings now. 

Please let me know your intentions by noon tomorrow:  Roll the dice and
continue to play or collect your money now.  

Thanks,
Larry Bevans

"Petrogulf allocation","Paul, we can give you $.04 into Kern or $.06 into WIC, but you'll need to
pick one or the other.  This is for November only.  Let me know.

Thanks!

We have told Enron we would give them 4MMcf/d of OTTCO transport to Kern
for November for the extra Petrogulf gas.  This will be in addition to the
10 MMcf/d allocated to Ultra gas.  I have heard the dehy bypass should be
done before this.  If not, we will have to send additional raw Jonah gas
around the JT to meet the 14 MMcf/d nomination.

Sherry, we're going to have to bump up their allocation to more like
4mmcf/d.  let's discuss this morning.

Marc, perhaps we can let them nom this at OTTCO?  Enron has been wanting to
do a deal here.  It may already be too late since bid week is well
underway.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Latest NFL Player News

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/23/01
Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He
was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not
return. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 12/23/01
Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play
again this season. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He
was replaced by Dorsey Levens. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/23/01
Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the
first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/23/01
Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he
left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. 

Martin Gramatica, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt
himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/23/01
Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to
start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of
his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham
doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be
signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3
receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has
been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to
Fantasy glory. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/23/01
McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He
played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be
a solid No. 1 QB.

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/23/01
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's
game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with
extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not
be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No.
1 Fantasy QB. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He
left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the
game.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a
hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.

Fred Beasley, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of
the regular season. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a
must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't
depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in
place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help
Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the
weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you
need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.
Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player
on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best
wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him
during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be
a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper
league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too
talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead
your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start
during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2
wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during
the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2
during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not
accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid
Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2
wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the
NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not
in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into
your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider
him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch
a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be
a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless
your team is very thin at wide receiver. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless
you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't
recommended. 

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a
reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best
during your playoffs. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his
yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD
reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your
playoffs.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be
very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Coles has been New York's best receiver this year. He will continue to be a
consistent TD threat during the Fantasy postseason. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Miller has been inconsistent this season. Starting Miller is too huge a
gamble in the Fantasy playoffs. 

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Martin will be a key player in many Fantasy championship drives. Keep him
in your lineup throughout the rest of the season. 

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Booker has been one of the better receivers in the NFC. Look for him to
produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. 

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Chambers may start this week because Oronde Gadsden will be less than 100
percent healthy with a hamstring injury. He will continue to be a regular
TD threat during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Pittman has been inconsistent as a Fantasy player. Don't rely on him too
much during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 12/21/01
Plummer has played well this season. He should be an adequate QB during the
Fantasy playoffs. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Williams (ribs) is now listed as probable. He has been practicing with no
apparent problems. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
According to the <i>Pro Football News and Injury Report</i>, Davis' status
for Sunday's game is questionable right now. He has told reporters he will
play, but Ki-Jana Carter will start in his place if Davis can't play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hakim has a sore back. He is expected to play against Carolina. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Faulk has a minor knee problem. He is listed as probable for this week's
game. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Bruce (foot) missed Thursday's practice. He is listed as probable for this
week. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Owens (hip) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Garcia (ribs) returned to practice on Thursday. ""We didn't do too much with
him but just enough to make him feel somewhat confident about making
progress this week. The important thing will be how he feels tomorrow, does
he become real sore,"" Steve Mariucci told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""I
didn't notice any wincing. I didn't see any grimacing. I saw him throw a
couple of frozen ropes."" Garcia is expected to play this week. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Bouman worked on a limited basis in practice on Thursday. There is a chance
Spergon Wynn may start in his place this week, and that decision may be
made on Friday. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Parker may miss this week's game with a shoulder injury. He has not been a
reliable Fantasy player this year when healthy. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Holmes returned to practice on Thursday. He should assume his regular
workload this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Franks (ankle) has returned to practice. He is expected to play on Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Gadsden (hamstring) has returned to practice, but Chris Chambers may start
over him this week. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Muhammad (toe) did not practice on Thursday. He might miss the game against
Buffalo, and Isaac Byrd will start in his place if Muhammad can't play. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Walls (ankle) practiced on Thursday. He might be able to play against
Buffalo. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Price (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Wycheck started off slow this season but has been productive in recent
weeks. Expect him to contribute a fair amount of points during the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Christian missed practice with tightness in his calf on Thursday. His
current status is day to day. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
George is listed as questionable for Saturday's game because of an ankle
injury, but is expected to play. Look for him to be productive this week
against a weak Raider run defense. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Look for Dyson to be a decent No. 2 receiver during the Fantasy postseason.
He might not score, but he should catch a few passes. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Mason is expected to play Saturday, despite suffering from a hip injury.
Look for him to be an adequate No. 2 wideout. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Ward hasn't scored a lot of touchdowns this season but is among the league
leaders in receptions. He should be an asset to your team for the rest of
the season as a No. 2 wideout. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Burress has been more reliable in recent weeks but still remains a risky
pick for the Fantasy playoffs. He will only be a good No. 2 wideout at
best. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect
him to be too productive during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Mack has produced an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't
scored a lot. He should be used in larger leagues only for the remaining
weeks. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
McCardell has caught a lot of passes this season but he doesn't score too
many touchdowns. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 receiver in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith has been one of the best receivers in the AFC this season, despite
his offseason injury. The veteran is a must-start for your Fantasy playoff
run. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Couch has been inconsistent this season. He is far too unreliable to be
considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has been solid all season. Look for him to be a good receiver
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Grbac has been inconsistent at times this season but should still be an
adequate starter during the Fantasy playoffs. Expect him throw for at least
200 yards and a touchdown. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Ismail has been a reliable receiver all season. Look for this trend to
continue throughout the Fantasy playoffs. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Taylor is not expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a groin
injury that has sidelined him for most of the season. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Dillon missed practice Thursday because of a finger injury but <i>The
Cincinnati Post</i> reports that he is expected to play Sunday. Even if
healthy, Dillon is a risky start this week against a tough Baltimore run
defense. Consider benching him if you have a backup of equal value. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Kitna, still recovering from a finger injury, is not at full strength. He
will start Sunday but has not been productive enough to use in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Scott Covington, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
The Bengals have signed Covington to their roster. Covington will backup
Jon Kitna this week. However, Covington is not worth using even if he
receives playing time. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Brunell is expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a quadriceps
injury that has limited his abilities over the past month. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
McNair missed practice Thursday for the third straight day because of back
spasms and is questionable for the game against Oakland. McNair first
experienced some stiffness in his lower back late last week. In the first
quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles tightened
up. However, he stayed in the game. Even McNair is unsure of his status for
Saturday night. ""If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it,""
he said. ""I'm very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time
the spasms have stayed longer than I anticipated."" Avoid using McNair this
week if you have a backup of equal value. His health status makes him a
major risk. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
The Cleveland Browns put Jackson on injured reserve on Thursday. Jackson,
who leads the team with 554 yards rushing, will miss the rest of the season
with an ankle injury. He aggravated a left ankle sprain in the first
quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and left the
game with two carries for six yards. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White will
share carries in his absence, but neither are reliable players to use
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Sharpe (leg) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Drew Brees, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/20/01
There still seems to be a chance Brees might play this week or before the
season ends, says the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i>. He has been taking
snaps with the first team in practice. ""I'm not going to say that he will
play, (but) could he play? Yes,"" Mike Riley. ""But I'm not going to say he
will for sure. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the
Niners' goal-line back, says the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""It's a
coincidence,"" Barlow said. ""It was my turn in the rotation to be in there.""
The two backs will continue to split carries. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Owens (hip) did not practice on Wednesday. He is still expected to play
this week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/20/01
Garcia (ribs) has been downgraded to questionable, but he still expects to
play this week. Tim Rattay took snaps with the first team on Wednesday. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
The <I>New York Daily News</i> says the pain in Hilliard's toe has
worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play
against Seattle. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Moss (quadriceps) has returned to practice. He might be able to play this
week.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/20/01
McNair has missed some practice time this week because of a back injury. He
is still expected to start. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Bouman (thumb) missed practice on Wednesday. He is expected to play this
week, although the <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i> says he might have to
throw in pain. ""We think he'll be practicing full speed on Thursday and
Friday,"" Dennis Green said. ""I think he'll get accustomed to how he's got
to throw the ball and I think he will be effective.""

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Wilkins will sit out again this week with a hamstring injury. Reggie Wayne
will be the No. 2 receiver against the Jets. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
McKnight is listed as probable for this week's game with a back injury. He
is expected to play against New England. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Foster (thigh) might not be able to play this week. Bert Emanuel may take
his place as Detroit's No. 2 receiver.

Oh...the agony!  Besides the afro, what else have you picked up for your 
costume?  You need to rent some white tuxedo shoes and a white belt to go 
with your orange or light blue, polyester bell bottoms.  (these MUST fit 
quite snug)  Not to mention a very hip large collar disco shirt.  The girls 
will be squealing with delight.

I'm very happy that we will continue to become better friends and I can't 
wait to spend some time with you again.  So incredibley cool that we agree 
on the same ground rules.  I'm sending big wet kisses your way...LOOK OUT! -

Latest NFL Player News

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/25/01
According to published reports, Muhammad is out for Sunday's game against
Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. Issac Byrd will start in Muhammad's
place, and could be a sleeper pick against the Falcons' weak secondary. 

Dave Moore, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Moore was held out of practice late in the week due to a left hip flexor.
However, he is listed as probable for Monday's game against St. Louis. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 11/25/01
Head Coach Tony Dungy has been holding Dunn out of late-week practices in
order to help his ailing toe. ""It gives him that extra time,"" Dungy told
the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>. ""He gets a lot of work on the first two
days, gets his timing and then we try to let him kind of get his legs back
for the game. We'll do it as long as he's still bothered by (the injured
toe)."" Despite the injury, Dunn will start on Monday against St. Louis.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 11/25/01
According to published reports, Brunell is expected to start Sunday's
contest against Baltimore. Unless you're desperate, however, you would be
wise to bench the Jags' quarterback in Week 11 against the Ravens' tough
secondary. 

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Wayne, who has a sprained knee ligament, is expected to miss Sunday's game
against San Francisco. Terrence Wilkins will get the start in his absence. 

Terry Hardy, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Hardy, who has missed three games due to a shoulder injury, is expected to
play on Sunday against San Diego. Unless you play in a deeper league,
however, Hardy is not worth starting in Week 11. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/25/01
Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New
England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,
but coach Mike Martz expects Hakim to be available for the contest. 

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/24/01
Davis is scheduled to return against the Miami Dolphins on Dec. 2. He has
missed the past two games while recovering from his second arthroscopic
surgery this year. 

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/24/01
Gary will be out for the rest of the season. He broke a bone in his left
leg during Thursday's game. 

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/23/01
Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to
a rib injury. His status won't be determined until gametime, however, so it
may be a wise move to reserve him this week. 

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 11/23/01
With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against
Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen will
be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/23/01
According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for
Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and
will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/23/01
Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on
nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list
Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught
just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/23/01
Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game
early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games
with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/23/01
Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a
fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half,
replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't
plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next
week's game is uncertain. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned
to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at
Philadelphia. He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his
postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10
victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback. 

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/23/01
Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained
ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith
might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week. 

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/23/01
Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games
because of a torn meniscus.

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/23/01
Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game.
He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the
primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against
the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch
a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis'
output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him
every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent
Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats
and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been
very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is
still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a
weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use
him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use
their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander,
and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield
in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your
active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.
Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the
run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has
been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the
wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you
should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has
only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect
another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season.
He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we
recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you
use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you
consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the
season.

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep
leagues.

Travis Minor, RB MIA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the
defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills
have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While
he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every
week.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the
end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but
you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running
back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'
secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He
might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and
there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas
City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep
league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your
lineup.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday,
which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We
recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against
the Jets in Week Nine.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should
rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against
this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less
mistake-prone quarterback.

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Alexander will be back in the
starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent
prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a
gamble. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't
recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this
is the game he will break his slump.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some
trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia
secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore,
and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at
quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat
Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for
explosive stats.

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to
keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less
impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes
than most receivers in the league.

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing
the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this
week if you have no other options at running back.

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance
Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight
end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However,
you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday
against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way
and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend
you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent.
However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer
downfield for great stats this week.

Dominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should
definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats,
but should give good rushing totals and a score.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in
recent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game
Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend
these two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be
Clark.

Dwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Carswell might factor into the Broncos' passing game more Thursday against
Dallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver. However, he had no catches in
similar circumstances in Week 10, and the Cowboys will be ready to defend
short passes to him. Only use Carswell if you're thin at the tight end
position.

Keith Poole, WR DEN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
If Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday's game against Dallas, Poole will need
to step up as the Broncos' top receiving target. However, we don't
recommend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a
reliable point-producer. Keep Poole reserved against Dallas.

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Don't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. he has been inconsistent
this season, and may not do much against a physical Pittsburgh defense.

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Mason should post respectable statistics against the Steelers. Don't expect
him to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense.

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Alstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't
expect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,
scoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. 

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Johnson threw for 399 yards last week against Chicago, but he also threw no
touchdowns and was picked off twice. He's been unreliable from a Fantasy
standpoint, and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Johnson had a big game against Chicago last weekend, catching 12 passes for
89 yards. He was held out of the end zone again, but look for that to
change on Monday night against St. Louis. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New
England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,
so avoid starting him if at all possible. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Holt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend against
New England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and is
worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Bruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven
catches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against
a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. 

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gary will likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas, but
we don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats. The Cowboys will
probably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky
starts this week since they have been splitting time.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
With favorite target Rod Smith likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have
questionable receivers to work with Thursday against Dallas. However, the
Cowboys' defense will probably focus on the run and force Griese to beat
them through the air. He should provide your team with decent stats and is
worth using this week.

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Faulk had 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against New England last
weekend. He's the best player in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in
any league format. 

Jamel White, RB CLE - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
The Browns may use White as a change-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar
Bengals run defense. You might want to consider him as a third running back
option on your team if you're lacking in starting options.

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, and is now listed as questionable for
Monday's game against Tampa Bay due to a shoulder injury. With the lack of
depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is
something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do if he's
healthy. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401
yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and
will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent
secondary. 

O.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Santiago catches the occasional pass for the Browns and could find the end
zone every now or then. He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati
secondary, so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores. Only use
Santiago if you're desperate for a tight end, however, as he rarely gets a
big yardage total.

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Johnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game
this season, and is now a very reliable No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver.
Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the
Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get him into your lineup.

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Couch has a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards,
four TDs), whom he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks
you could choose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week,
give him a look.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Warrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't
provided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league.
His matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him
reserved this week.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Although Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games
against the Browns, whom he plays Sunday, we can't recommend you use him
this week. He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from
a Fantasy perspective.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
We can't advise you use Kitna as he goes up against the Browns' secondary
this week. Cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year,
leading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the
Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678
rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in
your active lineup week in and week out in any league.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Centers has been a great pass-catching back for the Bills this season, but
he will face a Miami defense on Sunday that will likely be able to contain
him. Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks,
logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a bigger
challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reserving him.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
There's a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week
against a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent
limited role in the Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he
has a good history against the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and
he might be worth using as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.

Eric Johnson, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina.
Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth
starting at this point. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Stokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for 72 yards
and two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable overall,
however, so starting him is still a risky move. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Henry had a very disappointing game against the Seahawks in Week 10, and
will likely struggle again against the far-better Dolphins defense on
Sunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit using this week.

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a
strong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar
Seahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this
week despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the
bench for Week 11.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
After a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self.
We don't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so
don't use him this week.

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Sharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving
touchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced
Jacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe
into your active lineup every week.

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly
developing into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot
streak and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you
get Ismail into your starting lineup this week.

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Buckhalter will return from suspension this weekend, and will be available
for Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Staley has established himself
as the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhalter is a gamble. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Staley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in
Philadelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes
him worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Just when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two catches for 17 yards
like he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will still be in the
starting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gamble nonetheless. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Barber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a
touchdown in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run
this season, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their
offense in Week 11. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Toomer caught five balls for 60 yards against Minnesota on Monday night,
but he'll struggle to post similar numbers vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a
formidable secondary, so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a
wise move. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Collins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321
yards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into
the end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a
result, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Jackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does
have the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a
deeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Horn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing
through them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two
touchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against
New England based on his potential to post huge numbers. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Bennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the
NFL style of game. He's been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely
worth a roster spot at this point. He'll do nothing against Chicago's
aggressive run defense, so don't bother starting him. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Culpepper finally had a breakout game last week, connecting on four
touchdown passes against the N.Y. Giants. He should have success against
Chicago's secondary on Sunday, so be sure to include him when you choose
your Week 11 starting lineup. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
The Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament
in his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery
in the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him
awaiting his return.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Glenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the pre-practice
walkthrough on Wednesday, according to published reports. He is unlikely to
play Sunday against New Orleans and shouldn't be on anyone's Fantasy roster
at this point.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Chamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the N.Y.
Giants, but he's expected to play this weekend vs. Chicago. Chamberlain has
been unreliable of late, and getting open against Chicago's tough
linebacking group won't be an easy task. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157
yards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same
Lions, whose defense is questionable at best.

Good morning.  Just wanted to say thanks again for dinner last night.  I
had fun.

4:30 came early this morning.  It always does.  Of course I didn't make

"PT?","What does the T stand for?  PT...reminds me of the circus, are you really 
that much fun?  My ""boy toy"" is standing me up tonight, can you believe it?  
Oh...the agony!  Besides the afro, what else have you picked up for your 
costume?  You need to rent some white tuxedo shoes and a white belt to go 
with your orange or light blue, polyester bell bottoms.  (these MUST fit 
quite snug)  Not to mention a very hip large collar disco shirt.  The girls 
will be squealing with delight.

I'm very happy that we will continue to become better friends and I can't 
wait to spend some time with you again.  So incredibley cool that we agree 
on the same ground rules.  I'm sending big wet kisses your way...LOOK OUT! -

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house.

I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

Paul, we can give you $.04 into Kern or $.06 into WIC, but you'll need to

We have told Enron we would give them 4MMcf/d of OTTCO transport to Kern
for November for the extra Petrogulf gas.  This will be in addition to the
10 MMcf/d allocated to Ultra gas.  I have heard the dehy bypass should be
done before this.  If not, we will have to send additional raw Jonah gas
around the JT to meet the 14 MMcf/d nomination.

Sherry, we're going to have to bump up their allocation to more like
4mmcf/d.  let's discuss this morning.

Marc, perhaps we can let them nom this at OTTCO?  Enron has been wanting to
do a deal here.  It may already be too late since bid week is well
underway.

Paul,

Could you set aside some time today to talk to me about the recent Kennedy Oil deal in addition to 2 other deals.  These other deals were discovered in our bid week preparations, and are causing our desk some pretty big negative Prior Month Adjustments.  So, we need to get these resolved.  The first one is the Williams / wic deal. The deal #'s for that are 121890,854562, & 1068893.  The reason for the split of this deal is b/c our books changed names.  The second deal in question which needs to be resolved a.s.a.p. is a Red Rock Energy LLC deal #133661.  This deal is being booked to Denver in Sitara, but in Tagg the risk is going to Keith Holst and Mike Grigsby.  

Please look over these deals and let me know when a good time to talk will be.  Thank you!

Ok.....here's the deal. 

EVERYONE lost this week which means we all split 1st, 2nd and 3rd place
money. ($740 divided by 13)

We have a couple of options. 

1.  Receive $56.92 now.  (Maybe Bob W. will throw in the extra 8 cents for
everyone so we can round our winnings up to $57.00).  Game over.
2.  Let everything ride.  No coming back to collect later though!  This also
means that the pot of dollars will be smaller by the number of players
electing to take their winnings now. 

Please let me know your intentions by noon tomorrow:  Roll the dice and
continue to play or collect your money now.  

Thanks,

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 

This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 

In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 

Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 

But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 

As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 

Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 

Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 

Duress alleged 
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 

""We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,"" said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. ""We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal."" 

Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 

Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 

""The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,"" Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 

""Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,"" Shames said. 

Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 

Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 

He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
""To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,"" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. ""There were other means to manage the emergency."" 

The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
""First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.

Willingness to deal 
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 

The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are ""just and reasonable."" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 

Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 

For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
""In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ""We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone."" 

Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 

Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
""The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,"" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 

The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 

Sempra says contract fair 
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 

San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 

Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 

""It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' "" Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 

White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
""There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,"" White said. ""The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 

""But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"" 
***************************************************************** 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 

Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 

The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 

Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 

""We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 

A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 

In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 

Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. ""The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 

Said Freeman: ""We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks."" 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 

Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 

The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called ""peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 

The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 

Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 

""I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 

Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 

Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 

Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 

""I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 

The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 

The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
""It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 

Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 

Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
""The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. ""Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

Latest NFL Player News

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/20/01
With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander
will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their
charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the
Chiefs this week.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 11/20/01
The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain
the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill
Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe
to your roster as an insurance policy if you can.

Jonathan Quinn, QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this
week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/20/01
Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice,
says the <i>Seattle Times</i>. He is not expected to return for another two
to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer
for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 11/20/01
Mike Riley told the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i> there is no QB
controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be
our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want,
but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will
start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not
playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.

Mark Bruener, TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury.
His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is
widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/20/01
Wheatley told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> he is no longer being bothered
by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected
to return to practice early this week.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/20/01
Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky
start in Week 11.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/20/01
The <i>Tennessean</i> says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the
team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect
him to miss any practice time this week. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/20/01
Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against
Seattle.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/20/01
Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may
have to start in his place,

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game
against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/20/01
Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve.
Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to
be moved back into the starting lineup. 

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/20/01
Dave Wannstedt told the <i>Miami Herald</i> there is no QB controversy
surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of
hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're
going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/20/01
Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently
healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance
to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the <i>Denver
Post</i>. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a
situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our
team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."" 

Benjamin Gay, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The <i>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i> says Butch Davis won't indicate how much
Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of
the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see."" 

Kevin Lockett, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to
play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real
value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia.
Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been
feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the
'Skins. 

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/20/01
Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full
strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the
matchup is favorable. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 11/20/01
Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session
of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered
serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on
Sunday Indianapolis. 

Cecil Martin, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas.
He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this
weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy
player, but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley. 

 Giants, DT NYG - Team Dick Updated 11/20/01
According to the <I>New York Post</I>, cornerback Jason Sehorn's
surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past
weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either
Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he
continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any
receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/20/01
The <i>Baltimore Sun</i> says there is no indication that Grbac will be
replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough
to start for most Fantasy teams.

Donald Driver, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss
Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a
Fantasy player at this point. 

 Ravens, DT BAL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after
undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of
the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage
than usual. 

 Cowboys, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a
sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for
just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't
expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/20/01
Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. ""I'm not 100
percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job,"" Smith told the <I>Dallas
Morning Star</I>. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to
Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 11/20/01
Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He
may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this
weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the
league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11. 

Terry Hardy, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after missing three games
due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday
against San Diego. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury.
Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster
spot in deeper leagues. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/20/01
Stewart (ankle) is hopeful that he can play returned to practice and may
start Thursday's game against Green Bay. He will work his ankle extensively
in practice prior to Thursday, and is optimistic that he'll be ready to
play. If Stewart is able to go, he's worth starting in if you need a
running back for Week 11. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 11/20/01
Taylor has been told by a medical specialist that he should not return to
action this weekend against Pittsburgh. In fact, Taylor could be out for an
even longer period of time than what was originally diagnosed. Taylor tore
the groin muscle completely off the bone back in Week Two, which is an
injury that normally takes about three months to heal. ""It's going to be
very unfair for anyone to assume he will play any time in the immediate
future,"" said Taylor's agent, Drew Rosenhaus. ""He's just not healthy yet.
He can't run full speed without tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a
very good job in working him but he's still in pain."" Expect Stacey Mack
and Elvis Joseph to continue splitting carries in Taylor's absence. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/20/01
Emanuel is out for Thursday's game against Green Bay due to a sprained
ankle. In fact, the injury is so bad that Emanuel may miss the remiander of
the season, but no definitive word on his condition has been made by the
team.

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/20/01
According to published reports, Muhammad's shoulder injury will likely keep
him out of Sunday's game against Atlanta. That could mean big things for
Donald Hayes and Issac Bryd, who'll start against a questionable Falcons
secondary. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 11/20/01
Cleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'll likely
be replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last week
against Indianpolis. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
According to the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>, Carter expects to start on
Dec. 2 against Washington. Carter, who has been out since October with a
hamstring injury, will serve as the No. 3 quarterback on Thursday vs.
Denver. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/19/01
Hilliard continues to feel some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe,
and it is causing him to limp around a bit. He is still expected to start
in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf
can't be good for his injury. 

Reggie Kelly, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return
to action this weekend against Carolina. He won't make much of a Fantasy
impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01
Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas.
The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to
start this weekend's game against Washington. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the
<i>Tennessean</i> says he will probably miss some practice time this week.
He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

 Packers, DT GB - Uran Man Updated 11/19/01
Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during
Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the
remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting
duties in Butler's absence. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the
<i>Tennessean</i> says he will probably miss some practice time this week.
He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/19/01
Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays
were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day. 

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01
Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's
game against Dallas is unclear.

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/19/01
Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70
yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but
he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against
Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to
day. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/19/01
Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes
for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game,
however, and is listed as day to day. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to
return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more
weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate
Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value
in the offseason. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/19/01
Jackson told the <i>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i> it was a coach's decision
not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle
injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able
to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantasy value
might drop greatly.

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the <I>Dallas Morning
News</I> is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for
the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy
Football. 

Kevin Lockett, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib
injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain
at this time. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told
the <I>Washington Post</I> that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would
be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham
would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive
Fantasy option against the Eagles. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/19/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee.
However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas faces
Denver on Thanksgiving Day. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against
Arizona. He is listed as day to day.

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did
not return to the game, and is listed as day to day. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01
Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is
listed as day to day. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His
status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins.
Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent
Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary
will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing
defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open
often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit.
Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better
game this season.

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23
carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very
thin at RB..

David Sloan, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you
are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks
from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64
yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs
and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for
the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for
only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good
Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is
also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to
get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless
your team is very thin at wideout.

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is
not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his
third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player
you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year
receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards
and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks,
however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for
the entire preseason. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While
he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for
Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98
yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is
becoming somewhat of a gamble. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has
not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and
four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the
league and is a must-start every week. 

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and
three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every-week starter
in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers
when the matchup is right. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at
Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was
intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play
in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-start
every week.

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay
wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs and two
interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green
Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes a good
backup RB right now.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/18/01
Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the
Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should
not start for most Fantasy teams.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie
is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some
occasional TDs down the stretch. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at
Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup
right now.

Benjamin Gay, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 times
for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and lateral
quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White
shared carries in his place. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith
appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless
you lack depth at RB.

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
The rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets.
Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/18/01
Moss made his pro debut on Sunday, but did not catch a pass and was stopped
for a six-yard loss on his one carry. The rookie has missed too much time
to make a Fantasy impact this season. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Huntley actually had a good outing against San Francisco, posting 94
scrimmage yards and a touchdown. However, he's far too inconsistent to
start on a weekly basis. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
Weinke started Sunday's game against San Francisco after missing last
week's game due to a shoulder injury. He put up decent numbers, throwing
for 177 yards and two touchdowns in Carolina's 25-22 OT loss. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Chrebet did not catch a pass at Miami. The Jets' wideout is no longer
worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Hearst had another strong game, posting 113 scrimmage yards against
Carolina. His comeback from a serious ankle condition is nothing short of
miraculous, and he's actually been a reliable Fantasy player over the last
two weeks. 

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Van Pelt threw for 316 yards, two TDs and no interceptions against the
Seahawks. He did lose a fumble, but Van Pelt got solid protection for most
of the game and will be a respectable Fantasy backup while he fills in for
the injured Rob Johnson.

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/18/01
Garcia had another huge game, posting 305 yards and three touchdowns
against Carolina. He's been one of the top three Fantasy quarterbacks this
season, and may even be more valuable than Peyton Manning at this point. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Price caught 10 passes for 138 yards and a TD against Seattle. He has
clearly become Buffalo's best Fantasy player this season.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Hasselbeck threw for 134 yards, one TD and no interceptions at Buffalo. The
Seattle QB is making less mistakes, yet he doesn't help Fantasy teams much,
either.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/18/01
Kitna put up 234 yards passing and a touchdown against Tennessee, but two
interceptions made his performance mediocre. He's no better than a reserve
Fantasy player at this point, best used when the matchup is right in a
deeper league. 

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Robinson caught two passes for 15 yards at Buffalo, including his first
career TD, a seven-yarder. Robinson is slowly improving, but still does not
produce enough to be a reliable Fantasy player.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Dillon was held in check by Tennessee, rushing for only 38 yards on Sunday.
However, with all the injured running backs around the league this season,
Dillon is still a must-start on a weekly basis.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Latest NFL Player News

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was
replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
According to published reports, an MRI on Faulk's right knee revelead a
bone bruise, and no cartilage or ligament damage. He is expected to miss at
least one game before being re-evaluated.

Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect
Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid
outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical
silence,

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33
carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a
Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues
to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even
when Ricky Watters returns.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was
also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and
is no better than a reserve at this point. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and
a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but
he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches
for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting
every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a
roster spot. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two
touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very
useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right. 

Glyn Milburn, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will
be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against
Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider
dropping Bennett altogether. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125
yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at
this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Batch had a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three
scores. He's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the
performance, but he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Franks caught only two passes for four yards against the Ravens, but both
catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as a primary goal-line
threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Patten had a good game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73
yards. He'll likely be pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry
Glenn is back, so don't be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine
numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is
still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this
week.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. The
second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltimore
passing game.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Glenn had a huge game in his return from suspension, catching seven passes
for 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a weekly
basis, but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with your
receivers. 

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Brookins rushed for 33 yards and a TD against Green Bay. The young, strong
back might continue to emerge in Baltimore's offense as the season wears
on.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Brown had a great outing against San Diego, posting 11 catches for 117
yards against San Diego. With Terry Glenn returning, Brown could become a
pretty relaible Fantasy player facing No. 2 cornerbacks on a weekly basis. 

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the Browns, but he scored
on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scott in the passing game,
even though the final numbers haven't always reflected it.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Conway had a solid game, posting four catches for 117 yards against New
England. He is slowly becoming Doug Flutie's favorite target, and is
becoming a much more reliable Fantasy player than in years past. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win over San Diego, but he did
score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantasy player, however, and
is no better than a reserve used only when the matchup is right. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Johnson caught eight passes for 153 yards and a TD against the Bengals. It
appears the Cleveland wideout is starting to re-emerge as a quality Fantasy
player.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Brady had his first impressive outing on Sunday, throwing for 364 yards and
two touchdowns in the Patriots' 29-26 overtime win over San Diego. Despite
the great performace, Brady is still not worth anything more than a reserve
spot Fantasy-wise. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Jackson played against Cincinnati, but was limited to only 22 rushing yards
on 14 carries. The rookie running back, who played despite some rib
problems, has been inconsistent and unreliable so far.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Tomlinson's yardage numbers (87 total) were subpar by his standards, but he
did score another touchdown for San Diego. He's one of the top tailbacks in
the league and should be a weekly starter Fantasy-wise. 

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Flutie had a solid game on Sunday, posting 270 yards passing and a
touchdown against New England. He's still not worth starting every week,
but is better of used when the matchup is right. 

Justin McCareins, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
McCareins started in place of the injured Derrick Mason on Sunday against
Tampa Bay. He did have two catches for 70 yards in the game, but still
warrants very little Fantasy consideration. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Hayes caught seven passes for 44 yards against the Saints. If opponents
continue to pay extra attention to Muhsin Muhammad, Hayes might continue to
post some respectable numbers.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
George had his best Fantasy game of the season, posting 132 yards of total
offense and a score against Tampa Bay. The performance brings a sigh of
relief from Fantasy owners worried that George had lost a step after
offseason toe surgery. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Huntley rushed for only two yards on four carries against New Orleans. The
Panthers are still searching for a quality runner, but Huntley doesn't
appear capable of filling their void at RB.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
McNair finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, compiling 284 yards of
total offense and two touchdowns against Tampa Bay. He's still not a
reliable weekly option Fantasy-wise, so use him only if the matchup is
right. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Muhammad caught only two passes for eight yards against he Saints. Don't
expect such poor numbers from Muhammad very often. He remains a quality
Fantasy wideout.

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Green was solid on Sunday, catching six passes for 72 yards and a score
against Tennessee. Despite his good performance, Green is still not a
reliable player from a Fantasy perspective. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Cleeland overcame a hamstring problem to play against Carolina, and he
caught two TD passes. The injury-prone tight end finished with three
catches for 38 yards, but he remains a Fantasy risk because he simply can't
seem to stay healthy for very long.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Johnson had his best game of the season, posting eight catches for 140
yards against Tennessee. He's a top-notch wideout Fantasy-wise, and
deserves a weekly spot in your starting lineup. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Smith rushed for 50 yards and a TD against the 49ers. Smith's yardage
numbers won't be overwhelming the rest of the year, but he should continue
to be a consistent TD threat.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Dunn (foot) was used as the Bucs' featured back on Sunday against
Tennessee. He posted 81 yards of total offense and two scores in Tampa
Bay's 31-28 overtime win. 

Tai Streets, WR SF - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Streets caught four passes for 51 yards against Atlanta. With J.J. Stokes
continuing to wallow in mediocrity, Streets has a chance to step up and
take a more prominent role in the San Francisco offense.

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Johnson finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, throwing for 287 yards
and three scores against Tennessee. He is still not worth starting on a
regular basis, however, and is better off used when the matchup is good. 

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Robinson struggled on Sunday, catching only two passes for six yards. He
had been dealing with a sore lower back, which may have had something to do
with his performance in the game. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Thomas had 11 carries for 58 yards in Sunday's game against Arizona. Thomas
is inching closer to taking James Allen's starting job, and is worth
stashing away on your roster if available. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183
yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime.
Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best
receivers.

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Allen had a solid game on Sunday, rushing for 75 yards and a touchdown.
However, the performance is a bit tainted Fantasy-wise since it was against
a weak Arizona defensive front. Don't expect thos type of numbers from the
Bears' tailback on a weekly basis. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Surprisingly, Miller had a tough day against a shaky Arizona defense on
Sunday. The Bears' QB threw for only 116 yards and was picked off twice in
Chicago's 21-13 victory. Miller is still worth a roster spot, but he's no
better than a backup Fantasy-wise.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Canidate replaced the injured Marshall Faulk late in Sunday's game against
the N.Y. Giants. If Faulk's knee injury is serious, be sure to put in a
waivers request for Canidate as soon as possible. 

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Minnis caught one pass for only 14 yards against the Steelers. The rookie
has been inconsistent so far, and is a risky start unless he faces a
below-average defense.

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Hilliard, who was dealing with a slight oblique strain, played on Sunday
against St. Louis. He caught three passes for 49 yards and a score in New
York's 15-14 loss. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Alexander overcame back problems to play against the Steelers, but was held
to just one catch for 10 yards. Injuries and lack of effective complements
have rendered Alexander a disappointment so far this season.

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Jurevicius posted a solid game against St. Louis, catching six passes for
101 yards. If he continues to put up good numbers, Jurevicius could keep
Ike Hilliard from getting back his starting role. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Holmes rushed for 150 yards and two TDs against Pittsburgh. Such good
numbers against the Steelers prove Holmes has arrived as a quality Fantasy
player.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Dayne started on Sunday against St. Louis despite a neck injury. He rushed
for 88 yards and a score in New York's 15-14 loss, and may be solidifying
his grasp on the featured back role for the G-Men. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Collins completed 18-of-32 passes for 250 yards and a touchdown on Sunday
against St. Louis. However, he's still not a reliable starter Fantasy-wise
despite his decent numbers against the Rams. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Ward had another solid outing. While he caught four passes for only 38
yards, he did catch a five-yard TD pass, once again proving he is the only
reliable wideout on the Pittsburgh roster,

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Warner left Sunday's game against the N.Y. Giants in the fourth quarter
after having the wind knocked out of him. However, he returned to action
after being sidelined for only one play. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Grbac suffered a sprained neck in the first half of Sunday's game at Green
Bay, but stayed in the game until the fourth quarter. He was finally
replaced by Randall Cunningham when Green Bay took a 31-10 lead.

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Faulk left Sunday's game against the N.Y. Giants in the second half with a
sprained MCL in his right knee. Trung Canidate replaced Faulk, who did not
return to the game. Faulk is expected to miss up to four weeks due to the
injury, so it might be a good idea for Fantasy owners to pick up Trung
Canidate immediately. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Schroeder suffered an ankle injury just before halftime of Sunday's game.
He did not return for the second half, although he was available and ready
to play if needed.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
McNair left Sunday's game against Tampa Bay in the second quarter due to a
twisted ankle. However, he did return to the game at the start of the
second half. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Jeffers was declared inactive for the game against New Orleans. He is
getting close to playing form, though, and might return to action in the
near future.

Nick Goings, RB CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Goings was declared inactive for the game against New Orleans. Tim
Biakabutuka and Richard Huntley are getting carries at halfback.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Dunn is getting the majority of the work in Tampa Bay's backfield against
Tennessee. He had been nursing a foot injury, but seems to be close to 100
percent. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Pittman left Sunday's game against Chicago in the first quarter due to an
undisclosed leg injury. However, Pittman did return to the game in the
second quarter. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Dayne (neck) played in the first series of Sunday's game against St. Louis.
He'll likely be the Giants' featured back for most of the game. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Heap is out for Sunday's against Green Bay. Look for Shannon Sharpe to have
a productive game in his absence. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Mason (ankle and shoulder) has been declared inactive for Week Six. Justin
McCareins or Chris Sanders should start in his place.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Barber (hamstring) is out for Sunday's game against St. Louis. Ron Dayne is
expected to start in his absence. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
According to published reports, the newly-signed Leaf might be given a
chance to win Dallas' starting QB job. There is growing speculation that
Quincy Carter might share starts or playing time with Leaf when he returns
from a hamstring injury. Carter is expected to miss as much as eight weeks.

J.J. Johnson, RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
According to published reports, Johnson did not travel with the team to
face the Jets today. Travis Minor will be Miami's third-down back in Week
Six.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
George (ankle) felt better on Friday and is expected to start on Sunday
against Tampa Bay. He doesn't think that the injury will limit his
movement, and shouldn't keep him from being effective. Unless you have a
solid stable of running backs, it seems as though starting George is a safe
bet. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Wheatley is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Indianapolis
with a wrist injury, but he is expected to play. However, Charlie Garner
will get the majority of the carries if Wheatley is not ready to play
against the Colts.

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Ismail (knee) had another solid practice on Saturday and is expected to
start on Monday against Washington. He may be worth considering in larger
leagues, but the lack of a consistent passing game in Dallas makes ""the
Rocket"" a gamble Fantasy-wise. 

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/14/01
Jenkins will be used as Arizona's No. 3 receiver on Sunday against Chicago.
However, don't be fooled by his solid performance last week against
Philadelphia. Unless Jenkins shows that he can be more productive on a
consistent basis, there's no need to pick him up Fantasy-wise. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Mathis (hip) is expected to start on Sunday against San Francisco. He's
worth starting Fantasy-wise unless you play in a smaller league and have
the option of using a better wideout. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Coles (knee) practiced on Friday and is now exepcted to start on Sunday
against Miami. He'll be going up against a tough Miami secondary, however,
so you may want to consider benching him outside of deeper leagues. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Jackson (ribs) will start on Sunday against Cincinnati. He will wear a flak
jacket to protect his injured ribs, which should keep him from worsening
his condition. He's worth starting against a Cincinnati defense that can be
beaten on the ground. 

 Saints, DT NO - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Defensive end Joe Johnson (quadriceps) is expected to play in Sunday's game
against Carolina. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the Panthers this
week, which makes them worth starting as a defense Fantasy-wise. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/14/01
Hilliard is dealing with a strained oblique muscle, but he's still expected
to play on Sunday against St. Louis. He'll be the No. 3 receiver once
again, and isn't worth starting outside of deeper leagues. 

Damon Washington, RB NYG - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Ron Dayne (neck) is expected to start Sunday's game against St. Louis, so
Washington won't get all of the playing time in New York's backfield. In
any event, we wouldn't advise starting any of the Giants' backs this week. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to miss Sunday's game against St. Louis. In
fact, his hamstring injury is lingering so badly that he may even miss the
Oct. 22 game against Philadelphia. Reserve him for this week at the very
least. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Dayne participated in practice on Saturday and is expected to start on
Sunday against St. Louis. The Giants will likely fall behind early against
the Rams' juggernaut offense, however, which could mean a down game for
Dayne. If you can afford to reserve the big tailback, we'd definitely
consider it. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Dunn (foot) practiced on Friday and is expected to start in Sunday's game
agaisnt Tennessee. Dunn says that he knows the foot will bother him, but
he'll play through the pain. ""You have to play hurt in this league, that's
just the way it is,"" Dunn told the <I>Tampa Tribune</I>. ""My foot's going
to hurt the rest of the year; I'll just have to play through it."" Head
Coach Tony Dungy will use Dunn as the featured back in the game, not just
on third downs. With the current state of running backs what it is,
starting Dunn Fantasy-wise is advisable. 

 Lions, DT DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Defensive back Bryant Westbrook has been listed as out for Sunday's game
against Minnesota. This should mean big things for both Randy Moss and Cris
Carter, who will have an easy time beating Detroit's corners on a regular
basis. 

Bobby Collins, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Collins was released by the Green Bay Packers this week. He had minimal
Fantasy value to begin with, so the move has very little significance
Fantasy-wise. 

Kent Graham, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Graham has been elevated to the No. 2 spot on Washington's QB depth chart.
If Tony Banks continues to struggle, don't be surprised to see coach Marty
Schottenheimer elevate Graham's status to No. 1 in the coming weeks. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, coach Marty Schottenheimer will
give Davis more carries on Monday against Dallas. Davis has struggled thus
far, but it's been less about him and more about the Redskins tendency to
fall behind the opposition early in games. If ever there was a week to
start Davis, this is it. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Glenn will play in Sunday's game against the San Diego Chargers after
missing four games due to a suspension. He won't start, but will instead be
used in three-receiver sets. Glenn is worth picking up if available
Fantasy-wise, but he's not worth starting just yet. 

Jake Moreland, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
The New York Jets signed Moreland off their practice squad this week. He'll
make virtually no impact from a Fantasy perspective. 

Craig Yeast, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Yeast was signed by the New York Jets this week. He'll make little impact
Fantasy-wise, so don't consider him for your roster. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/14/01
Richardson (shoulder) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh. He'll likely miss at least another three weeks due to the
injury. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Alexander (back spasms) is expected to be in the starting lineup for Kansas
City against Pittsburgh on Sunday. He took all of the snaps with the first
team offense on Friday with no real problems. This game could be a real
defensive battle, so you may want to consider reserving Alexander if your
roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Rob Konrad, RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Konrad (ankle) will be back in the Dolphins' starting lineup on Sunday
against the Jets. Konrad has minimal value as a Fantasy player, so his
return has little significance Fantasy-wise. 

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Matthews has been released by the Chicago Bears, but he's expected to be
re-signed sometime next week. The Bears needed an emergency long snapper
due to an ankle injury suffered by starter Patrick Mannelly, so they signed
Ryan Benjamin as insurance. Matthews' was released to make room for
Benjamin. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Chandler, who suffered a mild concussion last week, will start on Sunday
for the Falcons. Michael Vick, however, still might appear in some
short-yardage packages. Chandler has looked good thus far, and is worth
starting in deeper leagues. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/13/01
After missing most of Thursday's practice with a sore throwing shoulder,
Griese was a full participant in Friday's workout and was expected to start
on Sunday in Seattle. The Broncos added Griese to their injury report
Friday morning, listing him as questionable. An hour later, however, Griese
had no obvious discomfort during a 75-minute workout. Coach Mike Shanahan
said he was confident that, barring any setbacks, Griese will play against
the Seahawks. 

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Don't expect Stewart to help your Fantasy team this week. The Steelers had
success running the ball last week, using a two-pronged attack, and will
stick to that strategy. Besides, Stewart won't be too effective when he
finally does throw the ball. He hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in three
games this season. 

Troy Edwards, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Edwards will catch a few passes this week but he won't be productive enough
to help a Fantasy team. The Steelers will run the ball for most of the
game. 

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Amos might become famous soon enough if he continues to run like he did
last week. Look for him to continue to run well this week against the
Chiefs and score a touchdown. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Burress' struggles will continue again this week, but it won't be solely
because of his effort. The Steelers will implement a strict running game.
They were extremely successful running the ball last week. Also, Burress
won't get open enough to be productive.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Dunn tested his sprained right foot in practice Friday and could return to
Tampa Bay's lineup against the Tennessee Titans. His status for this week
was upgraded from questionable to probable Friday, though a decision on
whether he will play won't be made until Sunday. If he is cleared to play,
Dunn expects to assume his normal workload. But he is a risky Fantasy start
because of his uncertain condition. Dunn won't put up good numbers if he is
less than 100 percent.

"RE: More shocking photos of the man on top of the WTC!!!","I hope you didn't buy it the first time around.  

We've been having meetings the last couple of days on our Canadian Hunter acquisition.  It's all very exciting.  It will probably mean I
stay here a little longer which is good with me.  I have more friends here now than I did when I was in Houston so I'd like to stay a while
longer.

I'm going home for my 15 year high school reunion this weekend - should be interesting.

What's new with you?

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Latest NFL Player News

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Kitna, still recovering from a finger injury, is not at full strength. He
will start Sunday but has not been productive enough to use in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Scott Covington, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
The Bengals have signed Covington to their roster. Covington will backup
Jon Kitna this week. However, Covington is not worth using even if he
receives playing time. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Brunell is expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a quadriceps
injury that has limited his abilities over the past month. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
McNair missed practice Thursday for the third straight day because of back
spasms and is questionable for the game against Oakland. ""There are
concerns,"" coach Jeff Fisher said. ""He hasn't responded like we'd hoped.
He's still pretty stiff."" McNair first experienced some stiffness in his
lower back late last week. In the first quarter of Sunday's game against
Green Bay, he said the muscles tightened up. However, he stayed in the game
and led the Titans to a 26-20 victory. Even McNair is unsure of his status
for Saturday night. ""If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do
it,"" he said. ""I'm very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this
time the spasms have stayed longer than I anticipated."" Avoid using McNair
this week if you have a backup of equal value. His health status makes him
a major risk. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
The Cleveland Browns on Thursday put Jackson, on injured reserve. Jackson,
a rookie, who leads the team with 554 yards rushing, will miss the rest of
the season with an ankle injury. He aggravated a left ankle sprain in the
first quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and left
the game with two carries for 6 yards. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White will
share carries in his absence, but neither are reliable players to use
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Sharpe (leg) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Drew Brees, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/20/01
There still seems to be a chance Brees might play this week or before the
season ends, says the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i>. He has been taking
snaps with the first team in practice. ""I'm not going to say that he will
play, (but) could he play? Yes,"" Mike Riley. ""But I'm not going to say he
will for sure. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the
Niners' goal-line back, says the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""It's a
coincidence,"" Barlow said. ""It was my turn in the rotation to be in there.""
The two backs will continue to split carries. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Owens (hip) did not practice on Wednesday. He is still expected to play
this week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/20/01
Garcia (ribs) has been downgraded to questionable, but he still expects to
play this week. Tim Rattay took snaps with the first team on Wednesday. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
The <I>New York Daily News</i> says the pain in Hilliard's toe has
worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play
against Seattle. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Moss (quadriceps) has returned to practice. He might be able to play this
week.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/20/01
McNair has missed some practice time this week because of a back injury. He
is still expected to start. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Bouman (thumb) missed practice on Wednesday. He is expected to play this
week, although the <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i> says he might have to
throw in pain. ""We think he'll be practicing full speed on Thursday and
Friday,"" Dennis Green said. ""I think he'll get accustomed to how he's got
to throw the ball and I think he will be effective.""

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Wilkins will sit out again this week with a hamstring injury. Reggie Wayne
will be the No. 2 receiver against the Jets. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
McKnight is listed as probable for this week's game with a back injury. He
is expected to play against New England. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Foster (thigh) might not be able to play this week. Bert Emanuel may take
his place as Detroit's No. 2 receiver. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Stewart (hip) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/20/01
Emanuel returned to practice on Wednesday. If his knee shows no sign of
swelling, he should play this week, says the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>. 

Aaron Shea, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Shea did not participate in team drills on Wednesday. He is not expected to
play this week, and O.J. Santiago will start in his place. 

Scott Mitchell, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Mitchell strained his right rib cage on Wednesday. He is doubtful for
Sunday's game, and now Kevin Thompson will back up Jon Kitna, who is
expected to start although he still has a finger injury. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Walls (ankle) particpated in some drills on Wednesday. He is listed as
questionable, and Kris Mangum will start in Walls' place if he cannot play. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Muhammad (turf toe) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as
questionable and Isaac Byrd will start if Muhammad can't play. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 12/20/01
Allen is ready to assume a larger workload, says the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.
He may start against the Bengals this week. ""I expect to see more time but
I'm still not 100 percent,"" Allen said. ""My hand is going to bother me but
I need to be out there on the field to help this team.""

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/20/01
Don't expect to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime soon, Brian Billick
told the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>. ""He's my quarterback now, he's going to be
my quarterback next year, hopefully the year after that and the year after
that,"" Billick said. ""The only thing that would change that is if he
chooses to retire or God forbid, he'd get a career-ending injury."" 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Chandler won't have too look over his shoulder this week. The <i>Atlanta
Journal-Constitution</i> says Michael Vick will not see action unless
Chandler is injured. 

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Jenkins (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable
for Sunday's game. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/19/01
Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not play again this season.
Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's final three games. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/19/01
Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week.
Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be
able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Henry will miss Sunday's game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will
start in his place. 

Tim Dwight, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Dwight (fluid in lung) is not expected to play this week. He has not
produced very much this year when healthy.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 12/19/01
Wheatley, who was not used last week, is expected to see some playing time
in Week 15. He will probably not be used enough, however, to help most
Fantasy teams. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Mason missed Tuesday's practice with a hip flexor injury. His current
status is day to day.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/19/01
McNair (back stiffness) missed practice on Tuesday. His current status is
day to day. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Sanders has returned to practice from a back injury. He is not expected to
play this week. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/19/01
Richardson is day to day with a shoulder injury. He is expected to play on
Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/19/01
Gadsden missed Tuesday's practice with a strained hamstring. He is expected
to play on Saturday.

Bill Gramatica, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will
be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games of the season. 

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 12/19/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder. He
might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma?afala and gained
73 yards Sunday. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 12/19/01
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week.
Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday
against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a
groin injury. ""But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come
back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's
playing in the right games."" Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His
health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will
likely start for Bettis.

Skip Hicks, RB TEN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/18/01
Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more
work over the final three games of the season, according to the
<I>Nashville Tennessean</I>. ""We're going to play Skip more,"" Fisher said.
""We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played
[Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This
development will limit George's production over the final three weeks,
making him a risky start.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/18/01
McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back
which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is
unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he
should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next
couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 12/18/01
Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against
Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear,
but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.

Gus Frerotte, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/18/01
The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a
separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably
start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his
backup.

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Cleveland Plain Dealer</I>, Jackson could miss the
remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable
weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay
and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time
the rest of the way if Jackson is out.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/18/01
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this
week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't
reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on
the Ravens' strong rush defense.

Scott Mitchell, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's
strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether
Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth
starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.

Akili Smith, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury
Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to
reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will
probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we
don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 12/18/01
The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati
after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10
carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three
after he recovered from a hand injury. None of the three is a worthy
starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/18/01
Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie
Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not
expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale
against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs,
especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at
any time.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/18/01
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a
sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game
against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you
consider using him this week.

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/18/01
Emanuel (knee) could be back in the starting lineup this week against
Pittsburgh. He will be re-evaluated this week to determine his true status
for the game. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Moss, still suffering from a strained quadriceps is listed as questionable
for Sunday's game. The injury has sidelined him the past few weeks. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/18/01
Davis suffered a knee injury during Sunday's loss to Philadelphia. ""He's
sore today, but he has indicated he'll be fine,"" Coach Marty Schottenheimer
told the <I>Washington Post</I>. Despite the injury, Davis is expected to
start against Chicago in Week 15. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Banks will remain the Redskins'
starting quarterback. Banks has been very inconsistent recently, but Coach
Marty Schottemheimer is expected to stick with him rather than go with
backup Kent Graham. 

Frank Murphy, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Murphy suffered a severely sprained ankle during Sunday's loss to Chicago.
The injury will likely keep him out of this weekend's game against New
Orleans. 

 Buccaneers, DT TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/18/01
DT Warren Sapp (shoulder) and CB Ronde Barber (hamstring) were both injured
during Sunday's loss to Chicago. They will be limited in practice this
week, but should be available for Week 15. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/18/01
Bouman strained a ligament on the palm side of the thumb during the
Vikings' 27-24 loss Sunday at Detroit. He will be listed as probable for
Week 15, but Bouman said he isn't sure he'll be ready in time for Sunday's
game vs. Jacksonville. Third-stringer Spergon Wynn would get the start if
Bouman is unable to play. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Minneapolis Star Tribune</I>, Culpepper will have
surgery on his left knee this week, possibly as early as Wednesday. There
is an outside chance that he could play in Minnesota's season finale
against Baltimore, but that seems unlikely at this point. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/18/01
Franks suffered a mild ankle sprain during Sunday's loss to Tennessee. The
injury isn't serious, however, so Franks will be in the starting lineup in
Week 15 against Cleveland. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Foster suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Minnesota. The
extent of the injury is still unclear, so the team doesn't expect to know
his status for Week 15 until Wednesday. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/18/01
Stewart suffered a slight hip pointer during Sunday's game against
Minnesota. The injury isn't considered serious, so look for Stewart to be
in the starting lineup on Sunday against Pittsburgh. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/18/01
Walls missed practice on Monday due to an ankle injury. However, Head Coach
George Seifert expects his veteran tight end to be available for Sunday's
game against St. Louis. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Muhammad is dealing with a slight case of turf toe, which caused him to
miss practice on Monday. However, Coach George Seifert expects his veteran
wideout to start this weekend against St. Louis. 

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Jenkins suffered a sprained ankle in the second half of Saturday's game
against the N.Y. Giants. He was still very sore on Monday, so his status
for Sunday's game vs. Dallas won't be known until later in the week. 

Bill Gramatica, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Arizona Republic</I>, Gramatica will miss nine months
after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament and medial meniscus cartilage
in his right knee while celebrating a 42-yard field goal on Saturday
against the New York Giants. The Cardinals will audition both Cedrick
Oglesby and Vitaly Pisetsky on Tuesday to take Gramatica's place as the
team's placekicker. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/18/01
Price's ankle is still stiff and sore. Head coach Gregg Williams will
evaluate him on a daily basis, according to published reports. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/17/01
Garcia has sprained cartilage in his ribcage, but he shouldn't miss his
next start for the San Francisco 49ers. X-rays revealed no broken bones.
Monday, coach Steve Mariucci said Garcia might miss some practice before
Saturday's game against Philadelphia, but he expects the quarterback to
play. 

Albert Connell, WR NO - Uran Man Updated 12/17/01
Connell will be officially suspended for the remainder of the season by the
team, league sources told SportsLine.com. Connell was a major
disappointment for Fantasy leaguers this year. 

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/17/01
A season-ending ankle injury to Ricky Watters makes Alexander the main man
in Seattle again. Expect him to put up good, if not spectacular numbers in
the team's final three games. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/17/01
Watters' season has ended with a broken bone in his right ankle. Seattle
coach Mike Holmgren said that an MRI test revealed the injury. Holmgren
said he will probably put Watters on injured reserve. Watters will decide
whether to have an operation on his ankle or let it heal, Holmgren said.
The injury puts Shaun Alexander back into the forefront at a crucial time
of the year for most Fantasy players. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/17/01
Franks suffered ankle and tailbone injuries on Sunday. His current status
is day to day. 

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 12/17/01
Conway injured his shin on Saturday against Oakland. His current status is
day to day.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/17/01
George was outplayed by Skip Hicks this week, but head coach Jeff Fisher
has indicated there is no RB controversy. Hicks will continue to see some
carries at George's expense, though. 

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/17/01
Joseph suffered a bruised shoulder on Sunday. His current status is day to
day.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/17/01
Gadsden suffered a strained hamstring on Sunday. His current status is day
to day. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/17/01
Thrash bruised his ribs on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing
time. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/17/01
Pinkston has no breaks in his clavicle. He is not expected to miss any
playing time. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Lewis injured his groin on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/17/01
Watters will undergo an MRI on his sprained ankle. The injury is not
believed to be serious enough to keep him out of action on Dec. 23. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 12/17/01
McNabb injured his wrist on Sunday. He should be able to play in Week 15.

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/17/01
Bouman's injured right thumb will be re-examined on Monday. His status for
the upcoming game against Jacksonville is uncertain. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/17/01
X-rays on Garcia's ribs following Sunday's game revealed no damage. He is
expected to start on Saturday. 

Gus Frerotte, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/17/01
Frerotte is expected to miss the rest of the season with a separated
shoulder. Jarious Jackson will likely back up Brian Griese for the rest of
the year. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/17/01
Dillon suffered a finger injury on Sunday. He is listed as probable for
Week 15.

Akili Smith, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Smith will definitely sit out Cincinnati's Week 15 game. He injured his
hamstring against the Jets Sunday and might miss the rest of the season.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/17/01
Price injured his right ankle on Sunday. He will be evaluated on Monday. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/17/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says Henry will undergo X-rays to determine the
severity of his injured right knee. ""It's pretty sore right now, so I'm not
sure what's going to happen,"" Henry said. ""It's a part of football. It was
an awkward play. I got caught in the turf and the knee just went.
Hopefully, it's not too serious."" 

Bill Gramatica, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Gramatica may have a torn ACL. He was scheduled for an MRI on Monday, and
might miss the season's final three games. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/16/01
Mason caught eight passes for 107 yards and a TD against Green Bay. Right
now, he is one of Fantasy Football's best wideouts in terms of consistency. 

Skip Hicks, RB TEN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/16/01
Hicks rushed for 142 yards and a TD as the Titans used him often to give a
banged-up Eddie George some breathers. Expect to see more of Hicks from the
Titans in the final weeks of the year, although George will remain the
team's top RB option.

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/16/01
The Titans limited Freeman to 42 yards on two catches. If your team is
moving on in the playoffs, however, you can expect better numbers from
Freeman in the weeks ahead. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Green had an awful outing at Tennessee, finishing with just nine rushing
yards and 24 receiving yards. Expect him to quickly rebound from such a
poor performance. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/16/01
Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against
Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of
starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Banks? numbers were subpar against Philadelphia. He threw for 186 yards, no
touchdowns and two interceptions in the game, and isn?t reliable enough to
be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/16/01
Jackson caught four passes for 85 yards against Dallas. He continues to be
one of the most underrated and reliable receivers in the AFC. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 12/16/01
McNabb had a decent outing against Washington, throwing for 235 yards and
two touchdowns. He did throw three interceptions as well, but McNabb will
be a solid starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/16/01
Alexander carried seven times for 27 yards and a TD in relief of an injured
Ricky Watters on Sunday. He saw limited action until Watters went down in
the second half, and his playing time may continue to be sparse when
Watters is healthy.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 12/16/01
Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12
carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries,
but he?s a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.

"Kennedy Oil","Eric,

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a ""Discussion Document"" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell

Welcome to the October Issue of the Wells Fargo Small Business Round-Up? newsletter. 

Better Bookkeeping, Better Results 	
Few small business owners enjoy the accounting and bookkeeping side of running a business. However, you can't and shouldn't avoid it. Learn <http://wellsfargo.z2c.net/ad/ck/1083-4800-233-30?m=1-30&mpe=1248145&mpm=9079006> about the benefits other owners get from these seemingly tedious chores. 	

You've Got a Website... Now What? 	
Just because you built a Web site, visitors won't necessarily come unless you register your site with search engines that direct traffic on the Web. Read about steps <http://wellsfargo.z2c.net/ad/ck/1083-4800-233-30?m=2-30&mpe=1248145&mpm=9079006> to make your site visible.

Check Your Calendar 	

Oct is National Disability Employment Awareness Month

Oct 28 - Daylight Saving Time Ends. Turn back your clock one hour.

	 I'm not planning to hire

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

"virus alert!","Sorry everyone! 
I've received a virus from someone else and now  your computer may be affected since you're in my address book. I'm told it  lies dormant for 14 days, 
THEN IT KILLS YOUR HARD DRIVE! 

NOTE: When I receive this notice, I updated my McAfee and ran a full scan, and it did not catch it. 

Here's how to stop it, if you've got it.  Also, send this message to everyone in your 
address book. I received this message, followed the instructions and got rid of it, so please do the same. 

The directions for removing it are easy: 

1. Go to 'Start' - then to 'find or search' (depending on your computer). 

2. In the 'search for files or folders' type in sulfnbk.exe - this is the virus. 

3. In the 'look in' make sure you're searching Drive C. 

4. Hit 'search' button (or 'find') 

5. If this file shows up (it's an ugly blackish icon that will have  the  name  'sulfnbk.exe' -     DO NOT OPEN IT. 

6. Right click on the file - go down to delete and left click. 

7. It will ask you if you want to send it to the recycle bin, say yes. 

8. Go to your desktop (where all your icons are) and double click on the recycle bin. 

9. Right click on sulfnbk.exe and delete again - or empty the bin. 

If you find it send this e-mail to all in your address book, because that's how it is transferred. 

I Apologize!

"RE: Loser's Pool","The jury is still out!  LoreLei Reid's pick isn't on the spreadsheet that
Bob sent to me.  Everyone else is out.  LoreLei may have left a voice
message with Bob, or sent him an e-mail on Friday? I haven't spoken to Bob
yet today.  If she's not out.....she wins $740.    If she didn't
survive.....a decision needs to be made on what to do about the pool.

Options:
1.  Divide $740 among 13 people. ($56.92).  Game over!
2.  Let anyone who wants to collect their $57 do so.....then continue on
with the game with the ones who want to stay!   
 
Do you have LoreLei's phone number?

Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 12/25/01
Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may be able to
return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Bettis is
progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/23/01
Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He
was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not
return. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 12/23/01
Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play
again this season. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He
was replaced by Dorsey Levens. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/23/01
Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the
first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/23/01
Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he
left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. 

Martin Gramatica, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt
himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/23/01
Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to
start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of
his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham
doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be
signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3
receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has
been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to
Fantasy glory. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/23/01
McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He
played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be
a solid No. 1 QB.

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/23/01
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's
game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with
extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not
be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No.
1 Fantasy QB. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He
left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the
game.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a
hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.

Fred Beasley, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of
the regular season. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a
must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't
depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in
place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help
Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the
weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you
need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.
Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player
on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best
wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him
during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be
a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper
league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too
talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead
your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start
during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2
wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during
the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2
during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not
accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid
Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2
wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the
NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not
in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into
your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider
him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch
a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be
a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless
your team is very thin at wide receiver. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless
you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't
recommended. 

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a
reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best
during your playoffs. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his
yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD
reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your
playoffs.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be
very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Coles has been New York's best receiver this year. He will continue to be a
consistent TD threat during the Fantasy postseason. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Miller has been inconsistent this season. Starting Miller is too huge a
gamble in the Fantasy playoffs. 

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Martin will be a key player in many Fantasy championship drives. Keep him
in your lineup throughout the rest of the season. 

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Booker has been one of the better receivers in the NFC. Look for him to
produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. 

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Chambers may start this week because Oronde Gadsden will be less than 100
percent healthy with a hamstring injury. He will continue to be a regular
TD threat during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Pittman has been inconsistent as a Fantasy player. Don't rely on him too
much during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 12/21/01
Plummer has played well this season. He should be an adequate QB during the
Fantasy playoffs. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Williams (ribs) is now listed as probable. He has been practicing with no
apparent problems. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
According to the <i>Pro Football News and Injury Report</i>, Davis' status
for Sunday's game is questionable right now. He has told reporters he will
play, but Ki-Jana Carter will start in his place if Davis can't play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hakim has a sore back. He is expected to play against Carolina. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Faulk has a minor knee problem. He is listed as probable for this week's
game. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Bruce (foot) missed Thursday's practice. He is listed as probable for this
week. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Owens (hip) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Garcia (ribs) returned to practice on Thursday. ""We didn't do too much with
him but just enough to make him feel somewhat confident about making
progress this week. The important thing will be how he feels tomorrow, does
he become real sore,"" Steve Mariucci told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""I
didn't notice any wincing. I didn't see any grimacing. I saw him throw a
couple of frozen ropes."" Garcia is expected to play this week. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Bouman worked on a limited basis in practice on Thursday. There is a chance
Spergon Wynn may start in his place this week, and that decision may be
made on Friday. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Parker may miss this week's game with a shoulder injury. He has not been a
reliable Fantasy player this year when healthy. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Holmes returned to practice on Thursday. He should assume his regular
workload this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Franks (ankle) has returned to practice. He is expected to play on Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Gadsden (hamstring) has returned to practice, but Chris Chambers may start
over him this week. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Muhammad (toe) did not practice on Thursday. He might miss the game against
Buffalo, and Isaac Byrd will start in his place if Muhammad can't play. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Walls (ankle) practiced on Thursday. He might be able to play against
Buffalo. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Price (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Wycheck started off slow this season but has been productive in recent
weeks. Expect him to contribute a fair amount of points during the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Christian missed practice with tightness in his calf on Thursday. His
current status is day to day. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
George is listed as questionable for Saturday's game because of an ankle
injury, but is expected to play. Look for him to be productive this week
against a weak Raider run defense. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Look for Dyson to be a decent No. 2 receiver during the Fantasy postseason.
He might not score, but he should catch a few passes. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Mason is expected to play Saturday, despite suffering from a hip injury.
Look for him to be an adequate No. 2 wideout. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Ward hasn't scored a lot of touchdowns this season but is among the league
leaders in receptions. He should be an asset to your team for the rest of
the season as a No. 2 wideout. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Burress has been more reliable in recent weeks but still remains a risky
pick for the Fantasy playoffs. He will only be a good No. 2 wideout at
best. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect
him to be too productive during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Mack has produced an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't
scored a lot. He should be used in larger leagues only for the remaining
weeks. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
McCardell has caught a lot of passes this season but he doesn't score too
many touchdowns. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 receiver in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith has been one of the best receivers in the AFC this season, despite
his offseason injury. The veteran is a must-start for your Fantasy playoff
run. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Couch has been inconsistent this season. He is far too unreliable to be
considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has been solid all season. Look for him to be a good receiver
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Grbac has been inconsistent at times this season but should still be an
adequate starter during the Fantasy playoffs. Expect him throw for at least
200 yards and a touchdown. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Ismail has been a reliable receiver all season. Look for this trend to
continue throughout the Fantasy playoffs. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Taylor is not expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a groin
injury that has sidelined him for most of the season. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Dillon missed practice Thursday because of a finger injury but <i>The
Cincinnati Post</i> reports that he is expected to play Sunday. Even if
healthy, Dillon is a risky start this week against a tough Baltimore run
defense. Consider benching him if you have a backup of equal value. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Kitna, still recovering from a finger injury, is not at full strength. He
will start Sunday but has not been productive enough to use in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Scott Covington, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
The Bengals have signed Covington to their roster. Covington will backup
Jon Kitna this week. However, Covington is not worth using even if he
receives playing time. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Brunell is expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a quadriceps
injury that has limited his abilities over the past month. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
McNair missed practice Thursday for the third straight day because of back
spasms and is questionable for the game against Oakland. McNair first
experienced some stiffness in his lower back late last week. In the first
quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles tightened
up. However, he stayed in the game. Even McNair is unsure of his status for
Saturday night. ""If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it,""
he said. ""I'm very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time
the spasms have stayed longer than I anticipated."" Avoid using McNair this
week if you have a backup of equal value. His health status makes him a
major risk. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
The Cleveland Browns put Jackson on injured reserve on Thursday. Jackson,
who leads the team with 554 yards rushing, will miss the rest of the season
with an ankle injury. He aggravated a left ankle sprain in the first
quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and left the
game with two carries for six yards. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White will
share carries in his absence, but neither are reliable players to use
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Sharpe (leg) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Drew Brees, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/20/01
There still seems to be a chance Brees might play this week or before the
season ends, says the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i>. He has been taking
snaps with the first team in practice. ""I'm not going to say that he will
play, (but) could he play? Yes,"" Mike Riley. ""But I'm not going to say he
will for sure. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the
Niners' goal-line back, says the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""It's a
coincidence,"" Barlow said. ""It was my turn in the rotation to be in there.""
The two backs will continue to split carries. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Owens (hip) did not practice on Wednesday. He is still expected to play
this week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/20/01
Garcia (ribs) has been downgraded to questionable, but he still expects to
play this week. Tim Rattay took snaps with the first team on Wednesday. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
The <I>New York Daily News</i> says the pain in Hilliard's toe has
worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play
against Seattle. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Moss (quadriceps) has returned to practice. He might be able to play this
week.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/20/01
McNair has missed some practice time this week because of a back injury. He
is still expected to start. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Bouman (thumb) missed practice on Wednesday. He is expected to play this
week, although the <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i> says he might have to
throw in pain. ""We think he'll be practicing full speed on Thursday and
Friday,"" Dennis Green said. ""I think he'll get accustomed to how he's got
to throw the ball and I think he will be effective.""

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Wilkins will sit out again this week with a hamstring injury. Reggie Wayne
will be the No. 2 receiver against the Jets. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
McKnight is listed as probable for this week's game with a back injury. He
is expected to play against New England.

  you as one of our opt-in subscribers. <br>
  We hope you enjoy and benefit from our efforts to send you the best<br>
  offers available on the internet. Recently we have received a number <br>
  of request from both customers and advertisers&#133;asking that we make<br>
  adult oriented materials available through our newsletters and offers. <br>
  After reviewing your request, we have decided to develop very strict <br>
  guidelines which will make adult material available to you. This decision <br>
  was not taken lightly, as our membership represents a broad diversity of <br>
  people throughout the world. We WILL NOT make this material available<br>
  to anyone who does not specifically request it. To make sure of this we <br>
  have implemented a three step process:<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. If you are interested in receiving Adult offers, 
  click the link below. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, disregard this email 
  as you will not receive any content <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; containing adult materials 
  from SaveRealBig.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. After clicking the link below you will be asked 
  to enter your email<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; address in the form provided, 
  after doing so click &quot;Submit&quot;. You will<br>

"Re: Match.com - You've Got Mail: Hello","Hey Paul-- 

OK, first, I'm sorry I missed your call Mon night--I was looking forward to talking to you! Secondly, sorry I didn't follow up your call with an email... It's been sort of a strange week in that I thought it was going to be really slow, but then have been busy not only during the day, but have had work obligations every evening, too--including this evening. While I'm usually happy to go home, I'll be particularly so this week. I just can't believe that Christmas is next week already. Ugh. 

Did you make it up skiing yesterday? If so, where'd you go? How was the snow?  While it did snow last weekend, it didn't start until Sat afternoon and we went back to Denver Sat night--in the midst of the snowstorm--so really didn't get to enjoy any of the fresh snow... just the headaches it caused. 

I'm glad to hear that at least your boss is optimistic about your future options...I'm less so about my own future, but at least being unemployed now would mean more time on the slopes. 

In any case, I have a dinner this evening with my team, but should be home (hotel home) around 10ishEST. If you're around this evening,  maybe we could try to talk then?  I'm dying to hear your theories on Elvis... 

:-)

Hey,

Got your email, I'm sorry your weekend didn't turn out as well as you might have expected, at least that's the message I'm getting. I thought about you this weekend when the weather turned out to be nice, and we had fresh snow on Saturday night. I hope you didn't get hurt skiing.

I think I'm skiing tomorrow. There isn't anything going on around here and probably won't be for awhile. Our boss was here Friday night for our Christmas party. He thought once everything was finalized we would like this new deal. So I hope he's right, it's still way too early to tell.

I'll try and call you this evening. I'm looking forward to the conversation. Remember keep your sarcasm in check, you know how sensitive I am.

Topics Open for discussion;

1.) Solutions for solving world hunger
2.) Is Elvis still alive and if so where is he. (I have a theory or two on this on! e)
3.) NSYNC or the Backstreet Boys, which group is more GAY
4.) Is Britney Spears really Madonna's love child

"Red Rock","Paul,

Just thought that I would let you know that the Red Rock deal which we were discussing yesterday does have an offsetting deal with OneOK, the supplier correct?  Anyways, the P&L impact on those two deals taken together is 0.  So, I am still looking into finding an offsetting Burlington Wic deal for Grigsby's WIC position.

Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>Tacoma News Tribune</I>, Seahawks Head Coach Mike
Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as
he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I
didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he
got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would
suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster
room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure
you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost
the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy
rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game
against Miami, according to the <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</I>. He
replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with
a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a
Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at
Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the
concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss
Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point
in the season.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected
to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of
Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend
you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is
hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this
week.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a
sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken
ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback
game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided
whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the
Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't
recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain
he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring
strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the
week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish
it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled
late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11
carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to
post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster
allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this
week. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury.
However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's
game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in
this week's game. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's
game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
<i>The Tennessean</i> reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back.
The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment
options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to
play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder
showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status
for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to
week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom
Coughlin told <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. ""It remains to be seen when
Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well
this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return
date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his
groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to
play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told <i>The Baltimore
Sun</i> he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game.
Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained
ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at
running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against
Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm
feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be
something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown
a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will
replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York
Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game
against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</I>, Canidate is expected to
start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I
wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said.
""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to
let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved
himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be
starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close
to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was
a blessing for me because I was able to get treatment every day,"" Stokes
told the <I>Contra Costa Times</I>. ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say
I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre,
however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to
be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants'
starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on
Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his
surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a
sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game
against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week
ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this
game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to
let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is
he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling
in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so
starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable. 

Dez White, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>, White will start in place of the
injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching
abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper
leagues. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Terrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus
Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. <I>The Chicago Sun-Times</I> is now
reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell
being used as the team's third receiver. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The
team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game
against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular
season game this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring
injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see
him by now, McGinnis told the <I>Arizona Republic</I>. ""That's why we both
handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning
to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he
can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still
on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday
night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron
Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge
of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week
Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the
standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden
opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks
to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.
The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep
him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress
during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seven.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice
this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye
on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against
Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,""
Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>. ""Warrick
pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who
it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured,
so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week
Seven.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at
Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he
should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK,"" Favre told the <I>Milwaukee
Journal-Sentinel</I>. ""Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that
will help.""

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a
sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren
finished the game in his absence.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Despite a great performance by Thomas Sunday against Cincinnati, the
<I>Chicago Tribune</I> reports that the Bears will continue to use an
alternating system with him and James Allen. ""We will continue to use them
both,"" said offensive coordinator John Shoop. ""Anthony did a great job
today, though."" As long as this duo continues to split carries, it's hard
to recommend either as a weekly starter in a Fantasy league. We believe
Thomas is the better long-term pick, though.

Brad Hoover, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Hoover left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury is not
believed to be serious. Monitor Hoover's situation. He might get some
carries now that starter Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the season. 

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Baxter returned from muscle spasms Sunday against Cincinnati, and had a
one-yard TD reception in the game. Despite the solid performance, he's
still not a reliable weekly starter in a Fantasy league.

Robert Wilson, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Wilson suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game and was held to a 24-yard
reception. He is also recovering from a broken thumb. Wilson will be
evaluated on a daily basis. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 10/22/01
Cleeland suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered
to be serious. He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception.
Cleeland will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Terrell will start at wide receiver in place of injured Marcus Robinson in
Sunday's game against San Francisco. If you're a Robinson owner, consider
adding Terrell to your squad. The rookie had seven receptions for 91 yards
on Sunday.

Neil Rackers, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
According to published reports, the Bengals are becoming frustrated with
Rackers' erratic play. The team might look into signing another kicker.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Jones sprained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Scott suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss
next week's game against Detroit.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/22/01
Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry
for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/22/01
Grbac is day to day with a rib contusion. His status for next week's game
is uncertain. Randall Cunningham would start if Grbac can't play.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/22/01
Allen is day to day with a sprained left ankle. According to the
<i>Baltimore Sun</i>, the Ravens have been shopping for RB help, indicating
Allen's status as a starter is anything but firm.

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Christian suffered a sprained neck in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated
on a daily basis. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Jefferson aggravated back, left ankle and big toe injuries Sunday and also
burst the bursa sac in his right elbow. He might not be at full strength,
but Jefferson is expected to play when the Falcons return from their bye on
November 4. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in the
Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again
until November 4. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/22/01
Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't
necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball
successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for
Bruce to do better next week against the Saints. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/22/01
Detroit Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg said Monday that Crowell tore the
patella tendon in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season.
Crowell suffered the injury while leaping for a pass in the end zone in the
second half of Sunday's game. The Lions will use a combination of Larry
Foster, Scotty Anderson and Desmond Howard in his absence.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Robinson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral
ligament in his left knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and
will miss the rest of the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field
with six minutes left in the first half after the injury. Marty Booker will
be the primary receiver in his absence.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in
goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards.
He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has
clearly emerged as a featured back.

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/22/01
Williams, who was averaging 4.5 yards a carry, gained just 51 yards on 21
carries Sunday, a 2.4-yard average. He had eight carries for 5 yards in the
second half. ""We couldn't do anything in the second half,"" Williams said.
""We didn't block right a few times, other times they filled holes and made
plays."" Look for Williams to rebound and have a solid game against the Rams
this Sunday. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Chandler had another solid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and
39 yards. He also completed 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to
be an adequate starter for the rest of the season. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/22/01
Biakabutuka broke his foot in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game after
rushing for 121 yards and a touchdown. He is to have surgery Monday and is
out for the season. 

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective
at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to
prove himself as a Fantasy player.

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was
good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games
this year and has become a major scoring threat even though he is not very
effective outside of the red zone.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a
touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however,
but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona.
Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a
starting nod every week. 

Doug Chapman, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers
were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so
far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot
stay healthy or continues to struggle.

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131
yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league
and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards
of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with
any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107
yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to
start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/21/01
Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on
Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's
still one of the top Fantasy players in the league. 

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a
score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a
Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Griese (shoulder) started Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was
ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions
in Denver's 27-10 loss. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the
potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not
find the end zone often. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran
runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.

David Terrell, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus
Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the
Chicago passing game.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly
establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears'
featured back for the rest of the year.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/21/01
Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit. Despite some
quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE,
especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to
Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but
he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/21/01
McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He
completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate,
possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a
reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production
this year. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The
speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good
numbers from him every week.

Alge Crumpler, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans.
Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the
year.

Albert Connell, WR NO - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is
definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the
Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate
Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/21/01
Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still
making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is
limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week,
but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh
defense.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards
and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his
potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position
lacking quality players. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed
a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout
should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He
also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile
good numbers against any defense.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of
total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be
short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a
score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the
No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a
Fantasy perspective. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Banks finally had a somewhat productive game on Sunday, throwing for 346
yards and a score against Carolina. His performance doesn't make him any
more valuable from a Fantasy perspective, however, so don't consider him
any better than a reserve. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
Muhammad was somewhat limited during Sunday's game against Washington due
to a nagging rib injury. He caught only two passes for 27 yards in the
contest, and may have cost some Fantasy owners a victory this week. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Jackson had a surprisingly productive game against Baltimore, rushing for
77 yards and a score. The rookie seems to be all the way back from a
nagging rib injury, and is slowly becoming a good Fantasy player. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
Crowell was carted off the field in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game
with a knee injury. According to published reports, he is likely out for
the season. Larry Foster will probably become Detroit's No. 2 receiver for
the remainder of the year.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Harrison had a huge game against New England, posting eight catches for 157
yards and a score. It wasn't enough to win, however, as the Patriots blew
out the Colts, 38-17. 

 Colts, DT IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
The Colts defense continues to be horrendous, surrending 38 points to Tom
Brady and the New England Patriots on Sunday. At this point, the only
Fantasy value this unit offers is if you have offensive players facing them
in the coming weeks.

This is worth considering. Let's all be careful! 


Hi All - 

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the 
reactionary thing and send out just anything that crosses my path.  This one, 
however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility in my 
mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of you. 

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago. 
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably 
upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied. 

On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished 
he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like 
that. The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any 
commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As 
soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since 
turned over the letter. 

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on.  This came 
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night. 

I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being 
correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second 
and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information 
that I did.

Latest NFL Player News

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect much from Alstott this week. Warrick Dunn is healthy enough to
start again, and will be the featured back against Pittsburgh.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect huge numbers from Morton in Sunday's game against Tennessee.
He'll give your Fantasy team a slight boost if the Lions are forced to pass
if they fall behind early, but we recommend you only use Morton if you're
thin at wide receiver.

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Stewart will have a hard time racking up good Fantasy stats Sunday against
a Tennessee linebacking corps that can cover a lot of ground. Start him
only if you don't have two other backs on your team with better matchups.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Chamberlain is definitely a good start this week. He will become a major
factor if the Packers focus too much on Minnesota's wide receivers.

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Booker would make an excellent Fantasy starter in his game Sunday against
the Bengals. Cincinnati is without cornerback Rodney Heath, which will make
it difficult to defend Booker this week.

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Expect good numbers from Carter this week. He is a big-game player who will
not be flustered by the improved Green Bay defense.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/19/01
Robinson battled a back injury in Week Five, but he should rebound on
Sunday against Cincinnati. The Bears will need to make some deep passes and
we think Robinson would make a solid Fantasy starter this week.

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Green Bay's defense has played well so far, but Culpepper won't be
intimidated by the Packers. He has faced them many times before, and should
fare well in an important divisional game in front of the home crowd.

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Miller will need to throw the deep ball often Sunday against the
overaggressive Bengals. He should post adequate Fantasy numbers, making him
a solid starter if you don't have any other superstar QBs to choose from.

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Green will get the bulk of his numbers in the second half if Green Bay can
get ahead of Minnesota early. He will definitely be good for at least one
TD.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Favre should have another excellent game this week. Minnesota's secondary
will not be able to handle him, especially with CB Robert Tate ailing.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/19/01
Dunn sat out practice Thursday with a sprained right big toe, but is
expected to play Sunday against Pittsburgh. He faces a tough challenge in
the Steelers' stingy rush defense, so consider reserving him if you have a
more established back on your roster.

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Schroeder missed practice for a second straight day Thursday due to an
ankle injury. However, he is listed as probable on the injury report, and
you should probably start him this week unless he takes a turn for the
worse before gametime.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/19/01
Moss practiced Thursday for the first time since aggravating an ankle
injury on Sunday, and has been upgraded from questionable to probable on
the injury report for Sunday's game against Green Bay. You should
definitely get him into your active Fantasy lineup as a result.

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Matthews could serve as the backup quarterback for the Bears Sunday in
Cincinnati after throwing in drills Thursday. Don't bother with him, as
he's not going to get much playing time the rest of the season behind Jim
Miller on the depth chart.

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Baxter practiced Thursday and hopes to be able to play Sunday in
Cincinnati, according to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>. He has been
recovering from a neck injury, but isn't worth your Fantasy attention.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Griese (shoulder) practiced with the first-team offense, and looked good,
Mike Shanahan told the <I>Denver Post</i>. He is expected to start against
San Diego. ""I think he did pretty good,"" coach Mike Shanahan said. ""He
practiced the whole practice. It didn't look like there was anything wrong.
I'm not sure how painful it is because I haven't talked to him, but so far,
so good."" 

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Wilkins (ribs) is not expected to play against the Patriots. He is listed
as doubtful.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
The effects of a concussion suffered against Miami has kept Chrebet out of
practices this week. He is expected to play against St. Louis.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/19/01
Redmond (ankle) is expected to be in uniform for Sunday's game. But it
appears he will not be used much, because New England has found Antowain
Smith to be a dependable back.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Clark should get open often against San Diego. The Chargers' pass defense
can definitely be exploited over the middle.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Smith should have another fine game this week. He will be the focal point
of the Denver passing game in a contest that will feature a lot of offense.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Anderson may find it difficult to reach 100 yards against the Chargers. San
Diego has a strong front seven, and the Broncos are having trouble with
blocking on end runs.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Jones has been a disappointment so far, but he could be a factor this week,
as the Chargers trade blows with the Broncos in a high-scoring game.

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Graham should produce good numbers this week. The Chargers will probably
engage in a high-scoring game with the Broncos.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Gonzalez will be a prime target against the Cardinals. Kansas City will
certainly see many passing openings over the middle. 

Chris Thomas, WR KC - Uran Man Updated 10/19/01
Thomas has moved into Kansas City's starting lineup. Don't use him unless
you are desperate for help at receiver.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/19/01
The matchup suggests Alexander will do well this week, but the Chiefs will
probably look to keep the ball on the ground, limiting Kansas City's
passing numbers.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect Wycheck to catch a lot of passes this weekend. He hasn't been
featured too heavily in the Titans' passing game and has been used more to
block for running back Eddie George. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/19/01
Mason is suffering from an ankle injury and is listed as questionable for
this week's game against the Lions. Tennessee expects him to play but don't
rely on him being too productive. The injury caused him to miss last week's
game. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Look for Bettis to gain some yards this week, despite the presence of an
imposing Buccaneers defense. He should even reach the end zone. Bettis is
overdue for a touchdown. He had eight rushing TDs last year but has none
this season. 

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 10/19/01
Stewart will have limited success trying to advance the ball this week.
Don't expect him to throw any TD passes. He has just one so far this
season. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/19/01
Ward will struggle to catch passes against a formidable Buccaneers defense
this week. Tampa has one of the best pass defenses in the NFL. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Look for Burress to catch a few passes this week but don't expect him to
score. Burress has not caught a TD pass in four games. He is a third
receiver at best. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/19/01
Holmes should have another big game this week. Arizona's run defense is one
of the worst in football, and Holmes will take complete advantage of the
matchup.

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect Jackson to gain a lot of yards this week against a tough
Baltimore defense. The Ravens have not allowed a running back to run for
over 100 yards against them in over a year. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
According to published reports, Faulk will now definitely miss Sunday's
game against the New York Jets. Faulk missed his third straight practice on
Friday, so the team will go with Trung Canidate as the featured back. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/19/01
Couch probably won't complete a high percentage of his passes but should
throw at least one TD pass. Consider benching him this week if you have a
QB on your roster that has a more favorable matchup. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Johnson played well against the Bengals last week. Look for him to continue
to produce against the Ravens this Sunday. Baltimore looked vulnerable
against the pass last week. Johnson probably won't be as successful as he
was against the Bengals but will be an adequate No. 2 receiver. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/19/01
Dillon will struggle to gain yards against the Bears, who have one of the
top run defenses in the NFL. Don't expect him to get a rushing TD. The
Bears have only allowed one TD run this season. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Kitna will have problems accumulating passing yards against the Bears but
should throw at least one TD pass. He has thrown at least one TD pass in
every game this season. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Warrick is recovering from a bruised shoulder but is expected to play in
Sunday's game against the Bears. Look for Warrick to catch a few passes,
but it will be hard for him to get into the end zone. Warrick has struggled
scoring points and has just one TD reception. 

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Scott will have problems producing against a stout Bears defense. He only
has seven receptions in his past three games. Scott is a No. 3 receiver at
best. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Expect Sharpe to have another solid week, as far as tight ends are
concerned. He is the team's leader in receptions and should get a
reasonable amount of balls thrown his way. Don't be surprised if he scores
a touchdown as well. Sharpe is overdue for a score. He had five TD catches
in 2000 but hasn't scored one this season. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/19/01
Allen should gain some yards this week against a stout Browns defense, but
don't expect him to get any rushing TDs. He only has two rushing TDs this
season. Nevertheless, Allen will be a solid No. 2 back this week. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/19/01
Grbac has been mediocre this season, throwing six TD passes in five games.
Now he will face Cleveland this week and the Browns have one of the best
past defenses. Don't be surprised if Grbac struggles. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Glenn injured his hamstring in practice on Thursday. He may miss Sunday's
game, forcing David Patten back into New England's starting lineup and
making Troy Brown the No. 1 wideout again.

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Muhammad (ribs) returned to practice on Thursday and is expected to start
on Sunday against Washington. Considering the state of the Redskins'
defense, we'd suggest starting Muhammad despite his injury. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/19/01
Weinke missed a portion of practice on Thursday due to a thigh bruise.
However, Head Coach Geroge Seifert expects his rookie quarterback to start
on Sunday against Washington. The matchup against the 'Skins is a good one
for Weinke, who should receive starting consideration from Fantasy owners. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Moore (hamstring) missed practice on Thursday and has been downgraded for
Sunday's game against New Orleans. He'll likely miss yet another week of
action, so keep him on reserve if he's currently on your roster. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
McNair is listed as questionable (shoulder) for Sunday's game against the
Lions but is expected to play. Look for him to score a touchdown by either
running the ball in or throwing. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/19/01
George is listed as questionable on the injury report with an ankle injury
but is expected to play Sunday against Detroit. Look for George to have a
big game against the struggling Lions. 

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Look for Taylor to catch several passes this week and snag at least one
touchdown pass. He has become one of Elvis Grbac's favorite targets inside
the red zone. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Ismail will catch a few passes this week but don't expect him to score any
touchdowns. He has just two TD receptions in five games. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Northcutt has been getting a lot of practice in the No. 2 receiver slot and
might fill-in for the injured Quincy Morgan as a starter. Don't expect
Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an
extra wideout. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
The Chiefs might depend on the run, so Green's numbers may be limited.
Expect one TD pass, but his yardage numbers will be modest.

Ken Dilger, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore.
Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this
week.

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once
again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New
England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this
week.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Wayne is expected to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the
second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in
your Fantasy lineup.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned
Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against
New England.

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was
intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against
them at home this week.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle.
He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green
Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether
he will be able to play.

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving
treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding
whether to use him this week.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might
have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff
didn't hurt him last week.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts
this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in
his second meeting with Indianapolis.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good
week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky
start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down
by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his
downfield speed.

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets
will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but
he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible
offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting
Davis this week warrants consideration. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18
passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't
even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a
decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers
in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can
be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first
interception of the year.

Walter Rasby, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen
Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at
this point. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary
on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in
larger leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets
secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your
starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to
ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the
questionable N.Y. Jets secondary. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this
season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more
reliable tight end on your roster. 

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Canidate will replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this
weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense
and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a
a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York
Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the
majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid
will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the
more productive of the two backs. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth
starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and
around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/18/01
Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this
season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit
suspect at this point. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial
collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley
will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for
Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on
Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and
should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Thrash has been somewhat of a bust thus far, and isn't worth starting on a
consistent basis Fantasy-wise. As a result, don't play the Eagles' wideout
unless he proves that he can be more reliable. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Dayne has emerged as New York's main threat in the backfield, and has been
relatively productive in the role. Even with Tiki Barber back in the mix,
we expect Dayne to get the majority of the carries in the game. He'll have
a tough time running on the Eagles' defense, however, be he's still worth
starting in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Barber (hamstring) is listed as probable for Monday's game against
Philadelphia. He'll be used in the same capacity he was prior to the
injury, splitting time with Ron Dayne. We'd avoid using Barber if possible
as a result, especially in smaller leagues. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Richardson (shoulder) has returned to practice, and is expected to play
against Arizona. He might take away some carries from Priest Holmes, but
Holmes has clearly become Kansas City's top ground option.

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Collins has been mediocre at best this season, but his numbers against
Philadelphia were respectable in 2000. He's not the best option
Fantasy-wise, but you could do worse if you're desperate for a quarterback. 

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Minnis has been replaced in Kansas City's starting lineup by Chris Thomas.
The rookie wideout has been having trouble with his route running and
communication with QB Trent Green.

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
Hilliard will continue his role as the Giants' third receiver on Monday
against Philadelphia. His decreased playing time makes it tough to
recommend starting him, but don't be surprised if Hilliard finds the end
zone against the Eagles. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Toomer will face a tough matchup on Monday night, facing CB Bobby Taylor
and the aggressive Philadelphia secondary. He's worth starting in deeper
leagues, however, but you may want to sit him should you have the advantage
of a deep group of wideouts. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Williams is silencing his critics this season and has established himself
as a top Fantasy back. He's a must-start every week Fantasy-wise,
especially against lesser defenses like Atlanta. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
This could be the week that Brooks breaks out of his semi-slump. Brooks
will be facing an Atlanta defense that is dead last in the league against
the pass, so the matchup is certainly in his favor. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Pathon (foot) did not practice on Wednesday. He is not expected to play
against New England, and Reggie Wayne will probably start in his place for
the second consecutive week. He may not return until Nov. 4.

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Horn is a must-start this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons' secondary
is very vulnerable, so Horn should have no trouble putting up solid Fantasy
numbers. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Jackson had a down week against Carolina, but don't be surprised to see him
bounce back against Atlanta. The Falcons' secondary is one of the league's
worst, and is easily vulnerable to a big game. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Biakabutuka will be Carolina's starting tailback this weekend against
Washington. Based on the matchup, Biakabutuka is well worth starting
Fantasy-wise against a horrible Redskins' run defense. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
If Muhsin Muhammad is still being hindered by his rib injury, Hayes could
be in line for a big game against Washington. In any event, Hayes is worth
starting in deeper leagues based on the matchup.

"Re: FW: Patina Oil & Gas Docs.","Thanks..

We should know something about the well we are currently reentering next week.  Timing on the gathering line is still uncertain.

>>> ""Whitt, Mark"" <Mark.Whitt@ENRON.com> 10/23 8:33 AM >>>

These are draft versions of the interruptible purchase agreement and
confirm for your gas into Fort Union.  Think about what you what to do
for term, volume etc.  We will then add in the gathering charges.  We
are pretty flexible, so let me know what works for Patina.

Thanks,

Mark

Latest NFL Player News 

Redskins  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Defensive end Bruce Smith, who was knocked out of Sunday's game against the Giants with a dislocated right shoulder, will miss two to three weeks while the tissue in his right shoulder heals and he regains his strength and range of motion. You shouldn't be using the Redskins' defense on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league to begin with. 

Keyshawn Johnson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1265&>, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01 
Johnson suffered a shoulder contusion when it was driven into the ground during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay. He should be fine for Week Five, but see how he fares in practice before making a decision on starting him next week. 

Tiki Barber  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01 
The Giants said that Barber should be able to return from a hamstring injury next Sunday in St. Louis. However, it is unclear whether he will get the majority of the carries over Ron Dayne, so be careful starting either unless the Giants' RB picture clears up by then. 

Ron Dayne  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01 
Dayne left Sunday's game against Washington with a neck stinger, an injury which the Giants said was not serious. He should be able to play next Sunday in St. Louis. 

Corey Bradford  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=12234&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Bradford left Sunday's game in Tampa Bay with cramps after returning a kickoff. He will be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Ryan Leaf  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=12506&>, QB TB - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
The Cowboys remain interest in Leaf despite ligament damage in his wrist, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram . They may sign him to the roster and place him on injured reserve. Leaf offers no Fantasy value at this stage of his career. 

Quincy Carter  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Dont Mess Updated 10/08/01 
Carter said the next 48 hours would determine whether he will be able to play a week from Monday against Washington, according to The Dallas Morning News . He has a strained left hamstring that he said he felt pop during the first quarter of Sunday's game. Carter isn't a recommended Fantasy starter even when healthy. 

Matt Hasselbeck  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01 
Hasselbeck (groin) missed Seattle's win over Jacksonville and watched Trent Dilfer lead the team to 24 points. Still, Mike Holmgren claimed the injured Hasselbeck will remain Seattle's starter. ""I said it before and I'll say it again,"" Holmgren told the Seattle Times . ""Matt Hasselbeck is our quarterback."" Hasselbeck's status for Seattle's next game is unclear. 

Laveranues Coles  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/08/01 
Coles sprained his ankle at Buffalo. The injury is not considered to be serious. 

Terry Glenn  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Glenn is eligible to start practicing, but the Patriots have applied for a roster exemption so he can get into playing shape. Don't expect him to be a solid contributor to the New England passing game in the near future. When he will make his return to the lineup is still unclear. 

Ray Lucas  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1418&>, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01 
Lucas appeared in short-yardage sets on Sunday. He still won't play often enough to affect Jay Fiedler's numbers. 

Kevin Kasper  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235097&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Kasper suffered a severely sprained right ankle on Sunday and will miss three to six weeks. Travis McGriff or Chris Cole might see more time in the passing game while Kasper is out. 

Rickey Dudley  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1357&>, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01 
Dudley played with a sprained foot on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing time. 

Patrick Johnson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=12477&>, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Johnson is expected to miss eight weeks with a clavicle injury. He had already started to fall behind the emerging Travis Taylor as a preferred target in the passing game. 

Chris Weinke  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/08/01 
Weinke was extremely ineffective against the Niners Sunday. He completed only 29 of 47 passes for 275 yards. Three of his incompletions resulted in interceptions while he threw only one touchdown pass. Weinke was effective in the season opener but has proven to be a Fantasy reserve at best. 

Wesley Walls  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01 
Walls proved to be quarterback Chris Weinke's best target Sunday against the 49ers catching 10 passes for 91 yards and a score. Walls won't do this every week but he will get a lot of looks from Weinke when he can't find his receivers. 

Terrell Owens  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1290&>, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01 
Owens was productive once again on Sunday, catching eight passes for 118 yards and two scores. Look for him to do well next week against Atlanta. 

Garrison Hearst  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1164&>, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01 
Hearst did not score but provided decent production Sunday against the Panthers gaining 74 yards on 18 carries. He is not starter material at this point but will be a good backup in most Fantasy leagues. 

Jeff Garcia  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=146325&>, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01 
Garcia was solid once again in Sunday's game against the Panthers. He threw for 212 yards and two touchdown passes against only one interception. 

Aaron Brooks  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=133233&>, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01 
Brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance Sunday. He only threw for 210 yards with an interception and no touchdown passes. Brooks has struggled in the last two games but the Saints will stick with him as the starter since they are winning games. 

Michael Vick  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235253&>, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01 
Vick was an adequate replacement for the injured Chris Chandler but he failed to lead the Falcons to the end zone. He completed 12 of 18 passes for 186 yards and also gained 23 yards on four carries. Look for Vick to return to the bench next week. 

Patrick Jeffers  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01 
Jeffers (knees) missed Sunday's game against San Francisco. He continues to make progress in his recovery from multiple knee surgeries, but isn't ready to return to action just yet. 

Kevan Barlow  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=235019&>, RB SF - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01 
Barlow recently revealed that he is playing with a quadriceps injury that has hampered his ability since training camp. ""It happened, what, two months ago? And it probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to work through it,"" Barlow told The San Francisco Chronicle . ""People don't know how bad this is hurting."" Barlow will continue to play but the injury might prevent him from taking over as the full-time running back. Keep him on your bench for now. 

Shawn Jefferson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Uran Man Updated 10/08/01 
Jefferson missed most of the second half of Sunday's game due to neck and back injuries. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Receivers Terance Mathis, Brian Finneran and Quentin McCord will be the wideouts next week if he is inactive. 

Nick Goings  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=237114&>, RB CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/08/01 
Goings was inactive for Sunday's game as Tim Biakabutuka resumed his job as the starting running back. Keep Goings on your bench for now. 

Tim Biakabutuka  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1082&>, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01 
Biakabutuka started Sunday's game after being benched a week earlier. He wasn't too effective gaining 45 yards on 10 rushes. Biakabutuka also caught two passes for 22 yards. Keep Biakabutuka on your bench if you have depth at running back. 

Chris Chandler  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01 
Chandler left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury was diagnosed as a Grade 1 concussion, the least severe on the scale. He is listed as day to day. Michael Vick will start next Sunday if he is unable to play. 

J.J. Stokes  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=1292&>, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/08/01 
Stokes sprained his knee in Sunday's game, but stayed in the contest. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Stokes had just one catch in the game for six yards. 

Laveranues Coles  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01 
Coles caught five passes for 77 yards and carried the ball two times for 15 yards at Buffalo. Coles has apparently become an important part of the New York offense in his second pro season. 

Anthony Becht  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3506&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01 
Becht caught three passes for 21 yards and a TD at Buffalo. Despite some early struggles, Becht still appears to be an key member of the New York passing game on third downs and near the goal line.

Hi Paul,
 
Ran into ""Tim"" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our ""get together"" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
 
Take care,
Debbe.

Jackie, Shelly,
 
Would you call Adele and see if and/or how much our Medicine Bow capacity will be affected for the 30th?
We will have to make sure and sell the difference at Glenrock into KN.

One unit at the Douglas Station on WIC will be out of service October 30, 2001 for approximately 8 hours.  Throughput for this period will be reduced to a rate of about 360 MMcf/d with a total daily throughput estimated at 450 MMCf/d.  

As this will directly effect all gas coming out of the Powder River, please contact your marketer directly as to how much gas they will be able to deliver into WIC on that day.  Allocations will be based on WIC allocation methods.

Just as long as we're clear that the Aggies never lose;  they are only
""out-scored"".

I think QGM is probably the only place you could take it, but even that is
not a slam dunk.  Black's Fork is full with the 40+mmcf/d we've been
sending them.  QGM has agreed to take about 18mmcf/d of unprocessed gas in
addition to the 40/d, but it has to be blended 1 for 1 with Shute Creek gas
in order for QPL to take it.  There is also a gathering fee on QGM (I think
$.07).  Since I'm new to this whole game and my shop hasn't taken over the
gas control yet (thank God for small favors), I'm not exactly sure how the
capacity at the QGM delivery point is being allocated.  Sherry Anderson at
AEC is still performing this service on a temporary basis.  Your Petrogulf
contact should give her a call to understand the options better.

6:45 tomorrow should work.  If you find that you can get away sooner, just
give me a call, as I will likely work until then.  I'm flexible on the
cuisine, so we don't have to do sushi (I do love it, though!).  It kind of
has to grow on you, because I didn't like it much at first.  Thai too spicy
for you??  Pick your favorite place and we'll go there.

As for your comment regarding Richard and the information I divulged above,
I think you and I both agree that you're forever indebted to me.

Excuses, Excuses the reason you lost was that your team scored less
points than the team you were playing.  It's that simple.  Anyway as for
dinner, what about staying downtown and meeting around 6:45 pm, if
that's too late we can meet earlier.  The only thing I know that is
healthy is Sushi, which isn't my favorite but I'd go if that's a big
thing for you.  Or, we can come up with other ideas, I'm wide open. I'll
eat anything except for Thai.

The lady I'm dealing with at Petrogulf is clueless.  The guy I used to
deal with is gone and she is new to this area of the business.  Since
I'm so nice and receptive to her feelings, I decided to help.  But I'm
sure you already know this about my personality.  I'm really not trying
to BS you with my emotional side.  I will tell her I can buy the gas
into Questar, if you believe that to be the case. All those other
delivery points need processing arrangements.  Don't tell Richard
Stewart anything about this conversation or YOUR buying dinner!

Subject: RE:



Paul,

The A&M game was tragic.  My friend Tim and I went to watch it at a
sports
bar and, needless to say, I was the only Aggie fan in the crowd.  We had
a
chance to tie it or win it in the last two minutes.  We had driven the
ball
from our own 9 yard line to about the CU 30 yard line.  We had a first
down
and were going for it when we fumbled ($%&*!!) and they took it back for
a
touchdown.  The waitress felt sorry for me and bought us a shot of I
don't
even know what.  I'm headed to Texas in a couple of weeks to see the
Aggies
Beat the Hell Outta Iowa State at Kyle Field.  I haven't been to Kyle
Field
in ages so I'm really looking forward to it.

Petrogulf's agreement indicates they have access to all major delivery
points except Opal until the expansion is in place.  These other points
would include QGM, MGR, OTTCO and QPL.  It's a bit curious to me that
they
would have QPL and OTTCO now since they have to go down the 20"" to get
there.  Seems like these would be in the same boat with the Opal option,
so
maybe this is not a true, current option.  Can't Petrogulf tell you this
stuff?  It's not my place to do it, and the only reason I am is because
you're going to drop a large sum of money taking me out to dinner
(kidding!!).

As for dinner, yes I'm still available.  As for the place, don't feel
like
you need to drop a bunch of cash (although cash is thrilling, isn't
it??).
I'm happy eating just about anything.  I'm trying to be on a new health
kick, so healthy fare sounds appealing.  My only condition is that I
can't
stay out late because I have a 5:30am appointment at the gym with my
trainer Thurs. am.  It's brutal.  I leave the house at 5am.  Want to
stay
downtown or venture out?

Hello,

I'm back in the office today.  Well I see you have to eat crow!  I
didn't get a chance to watch the game but I saw CU play Kansas St. and
CU looked good. I even think CU has a good chance of beating UT in
Austin this weekend.

As far as Petrogulf goes, in the mean time before the great expansion,
do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline
delivery points.  I think they can take their gas in kind at
Questar/Bird Canyon, but I'm not sure.

And finally, are you still available for dinner Wednesday night.  I just
got paid so I'm looking to take you some place nice.  Yes, I am bribing
you!

Paul

Paul,

Once the expansion is completed (in the next couple of months),
Petrogulf
will have access to all delivery points off Jonah.  They currently don't
have access to Opal.  I think that's all the super secret information I
can
divulge.

Hope you have a great weekend.  I have a small wager with Shari Wojta
that
the Fightin' Texas Aggies will Beat the Hell Outta CU tomorrow.  Hope I
don't have to eat crow.

See you next week.

Natural Gas Futures Rally on Short-Covering 


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX jumped $0.155 
higher Friday to $2.774 per MMBtu as winter's chill and forecasts for 
continued cold throughout January for eastern states and the Midwest 
had locals scurrying to cover their short positions. The March 
contract gained $0.123 to $2.746 per MMBtu. A flurry of buying 
started early in the session, a reaction in part to Thursday's 
liquidation on the January contract expiration. Clearing the books of 
Enron-related hedging losers in time for year-end could also be 
playing a role in Friday's rally. Some of the volatility over the 
past month has been triggered by larger books balancing their hedges. 
Enron's demise has forced counter-parties to recontract supplies, 
pushing the market with offers or with bids. Shuffling monthly 
spreads from fall to winter and balancing volumes bought at higher 
prices during the summer for storage will also trickle to a stop mid-
January as some storage operators call for contracted withdrawals. 
The AGA will again delay its release of last week's storage data 
until Thursday because of the holidays. For the first time this 
winter, many traders are anticipating a triple digit withdrawal this 
week. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was 
generally flat to $0.10 higher Friday. Natural gas for next day 
delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.01 to $2.64 per MMBtu.

Shareholder Activism Driven by Enron Problems

    Pension funds, stockholders groups and outspoken investors have 
began flooding the firms they own with proposals for change driven 
this year by the collapse of Enron. Shareholders are using this 
year's filings to try to make sure other companies don't go the same 
way as Enron. What is new this year is the auditor independence 
proposals. Pension funds affiliated with the United Brotherhood of 
Carpenters union have filed 12 proposals calling on companies not to 
hire the same accounting firm to do both audit and non-audit work. 
Enron, paid Andersen $52 million in 2000 for both audit and non-audit 
services, a dual relationship that has raised questions about 
Andersen's judgment. The proposals are part of an annual flood that 
hits companies around the end of year. Their goal is to be included 
in the company's proxy statement, which is mailed to all 
shareholders, as an item to be brought to the floor of the company's 
annual meeting for a vote. If companies want to exclude qualified 
proposals from their proxies, they need approval from the SEC. In 
2001 the SEC handled 438 requests from companies for permission to 
exclude shareholder proposals from their proxies.

TXU Proposes Settlement for Overcharges

    TXU Electric has filed a plan with the Texas PUC to settle 
charges that it erroneously collected stranded payment costs before 
the state opens its power market next week. The costs are aimed at 
offsetting expenses for building generating plants and related 
regulatory financing plans prior to deregulation. As natural gas 
prices soared a year ago, the PUC alleged that TXU and other Texas 
utilities had no stranded costs related to generating assets because 
of the large amount of natural gas fired generation in the state. 
Climbing prices made natural gas fired plants almost as costly to 
operate as nuclear plants. If the settlement is approved by the PUC, 
TXU will return $350 million to retail electric suppliers over 2 
years by providing credits on transmission and distribution rates. 
TXU said it may take a charge of less than $50 million in the 4th 
quarter because of the settlement. TXU also said it would eliminate 
any remaining stranded costs related to its Comanche Peak nuclear 
station. TXU also proposes that the PUC authorize it to issue $500 
million in bonds in early 2002 and $800 million after 2003 related to 
the utility's regulatory assets or previous financing agreements 
approved by the PUC. The settlement also cuts a possible penalty to 
$90 per customer from $150 in the event TXUs retail affiliate retains 
more than 60% of its customers after the first 2 years of 
competition.

Exelon Power Team to Double its Wind Capacity 
  
    Exelon Power Team will purchase the output of a 65 MW wind 
facility in Tucker County, WV for 20 years from Backbone Mountain 
Windpower. The project will include about 42 wind turbines, each 
producing about 1.5 MW. The 65 MW facility will utilize the latest 
wind turbine technology and will be the largest commercial wind 
energy facility in the eastern US. The project is expected to be 
operational by December 2002. It will interconnect with the Allegheny 
Power System in the PJM West RTO and will be integrated with the PJM 
RTO. Earlier this year, Power Team signed 20-year purchase agreements 
for 9 MW from the Somerset Wind Power Project, 15 MW from the Mill 
Run Wind Project and 52 MW from the Moosic Mountain Wind Farm near 
Scranton. This agreement brings Power Team's wind portfolio to 144 
MW. The Backbone Mountain Wind Project will add to the amount of 
clean energy available to customers in the PJM territory. Community 
Energy and Power Team are jointly marketing the output of wind 
projects. Large commercial customers, such as the University of 
Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University, Penn State University, 
Philadelphia Suburban Water Company and Giant Eagle Foods, have 
already purchased wind energy from Power Team and Community Energy 
for periods from 15 years. Power Team's current renewable supply 
portfolio includes wind, landfill gas, hydroelectric, and biomass 
generation.

FERC Order Sets Direction in Midwest

   The FERC December 19th decision that the Midwest ISO be the 
vehicle for a single, regional transmission organization in the 
Midwest is an important decision.  It will spark the development of a 
competitive regional power market in the Midwest, of particular 
importance to energy-intensive Midwestern states, according to a 
customer coalition active in the federal arena. The Coalition of 
Midwest Transmission Customers and the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio, 
stated that FERC's decision paves the way for actual implementation 
of plans to get a truly independent entity for the Midwest 
transmission grid, that encompasses twenty states and Manitoba, 
Canada, up and running. The coordination so critical to system 
reliability and Ohio's business and industry can now proceed on a 
timeline that should allow the Midwest to avoid a repetition of 
problems we saw a couple of summers ago.  Because the Midwest economy 
is so energy-intensive, the Coalition hopes to see the ISO continue 
with development at a challenging pace since an effective regional 
marketplace will benefit not only residential users but also 
Midwestern businesses in their efforts to thrive in the worldwide 
marketplace. The FERC Order also found that creation of the Alliance 
RTO does not satisfy scope and configuration requirements spelled out 
in FERC's Order 2000. The Commission made plain that the Alliance 
companies could continue with the formation of the for-profit 
Transco, but under the Midwest ISO umbrella. The significance of 
this, is that the FERC is focusing on the importance of a single 
organization as opposed to its form. From the perspective of market 
participants, both buyers and sellers, this and other recent FERC 
decisions are strong indications that a highly coordinated and 
competitive marketplace is the goal for the industry. FERC's November 
20th orders preventing several utilities from using their market-
pricing authority in areas where they have market power is as 
critical to nurturing an effective market as the order for a single 
Midwest RTO.

K2 Innovative Drilling Technology 

   K2 Energy in conjunction with Midnight Sun Drilling from 
Whitehorse, Yukon, has made a major break-through in shallow natural 
gas drilling. By utilizing a hard rock mining rig and adapting its 
reverse circulation center sampling technology to shallow low-
pressure gas drilling, the resulting formation damage is virtually 
eliminated. The air circulates down between the inner and outer drill 
pipe, drives the air hammer, and reverse circulates the rock cuttings 
back up to surface. This virtually eliminates drilling damage to the 
formation.

Latest NFL Player News 

Tim Biakabutuka  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1082&>, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his right foot. ""He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,"" coach George Seifert said Wednesday. ""Basically, it just separated,"" Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. ""The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together."" Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again. 

James Stewart  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1116&>, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01 
Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/25/01 
Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01 
Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be limited if he does play Sunday. 

Clint Stoerner  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season. 

Anthony Wright  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday. Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01 
Davis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited. 

Amani Toomer  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/24/01 
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01 
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/24/01 
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear. 

Bert Emanuel  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1186&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up. 

Hines Ward  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee. 

Germane Crowell  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=12306&>, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season. 

Santana Moss  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2. 

Brett Favre  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1028&>, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01 
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight. 

Marvin Minnis  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=235122&>, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01 
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts. 

Larry Foster  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks. 

Marcus Robinson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1676&>, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/24/01 
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league. 

Neil Rackers  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play. 

Todd Pinkston  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=187621&>, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/24/01 
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week. 

Joe Jurevicius  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=12484&>, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01 
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=133247&>, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01 
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01 
According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch. 

Trent Dilfer  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. 

Matt Hasselbeck  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01 
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01 
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Steve McNair  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1069&>, Active QB Updated 10/23/01 
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Rob Moore  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1183&>, Active WR Updated 10/23/01 
According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season game this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republic . ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. 

Az-Zahir Hakim  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=12411&>, Active WR Updated 10/23/01 
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Duce Staley  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1757&>, Active RB Updated 10/23/01 
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Ike Hilliard  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1785&>, Active WR Updated 10/23/01 
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Desmond Clark  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=133250&>, Active TE Updated 10/21/01 
Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis. 

Mike Alstott  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1169&>, Active RB Updated 10/19/01 
Don't expect much from Alstott this week. Warrick Dunn is healthy enough to start again, and will be the featured back against Pittsburgh.

Cris Carter  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1248&>, Active WR Updated 10/19/01 
Expect good numbers from Carter this week. He is a big-game player who will not be flustered by the improved Green Bay defense.

Marty Booker  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=133228&>, Active WR Updated 10/19/01 
Booker would make an excellent Fantasy starter in his game Sunday against the Bengals. Cincinnati is without cornerback Rodney Heath, which will make it difficult to defend Booker this week.

Kurt Warner  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=12797&>, Active QB Updated 10/18/01 
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Charlie Garner  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1149&>, Active RB Updated 10/17/01 
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Nick Goings  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=237114&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/14/01 
Goings was declared inactive for the game against New Orleans. Tim Biakabutuka and Richard Huntley are getting carries at halfback.

Ravens  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=3&>, Active DT Updated 10/07/01 
Linebacker Ray Lewis (elbow) was in the starting lineup for Baltimore in Sunday's game against Tennessee. Baltimore's defense looks spectacular early on, and could put up some big Fantasy points against the Titans. 

David Akers  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=966&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00 
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Trent Dilfer <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.

Marshall Faulk <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
According to published reports, an MRI on Faulk's right knee revelead a bone bruise, and no cartilage or ligament damage. He is expected to miss at least one game before being re-evaluated.

Eddie Kennison <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/e! li! nk?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1296&> , WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical silence,

Shaun Alexander <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=187382&>, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33 carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even when Ricky Watters returns.

Jay Fiedler <http://football215.fa! nt! asy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=12363&>, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and is no better than a reserve at this point. 

Lamar Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective. 




Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a roster spot.  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=187742&>Vinny Testaverde <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right. 

Glyn Milburn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1221&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
M! il! burn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Michael Bennett <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider dropping Bennett altogether. 

Germane Crowell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=12306&>, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available. 

Charlie Batch <http://football21! 5.! fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=12204&>, QB DET - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Batch had a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three scores. He's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the performance, but he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues. 

Bubba Franks <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=187388&>, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Franks caught only two passes for four yards against the Ravens, but both catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as a primary goal-line threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.

David Patten <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1790&>,! W! R NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Patten had a good game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73 yards. He'll likely be pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry Glenn is back, so don't be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1226&>, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this week.

Travis Taylor <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=187399&>, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. The second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltimore passing game.

Terry Glenn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Glenn had a huge game in his return from suspension, catching seven passes for 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a weekly basis, but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with your receivers. 

Jason Brookins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Brookins rushed for 33 yards and a TD agai! ns! t Green Bay. The young, strong back might continue to emerge in Baltimore's offense as the season wears on. 

Troy Brown <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1253&>, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Brown had a great outing against San Diego, posting 11 catches for 117 yards against San Diego. With Terry Glenn returning, Brown could become a pretty relaible Fantasy player facing No. 2 cornerbacks on a weekly basis. 

Darnay Scott <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1212&>, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/14/01
Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the Browns, but he scored on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scott in the passing game, even though the final numbers haven't always reflected it.

Curtis Conway <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1204&>, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/14/01
Conway had a solid game, posting four catches for 117 yards against New England. He is slowly becoming Doug Flutie's favorite target, and is becoming a much more reliable Fantasy player than in years past. 

Antowain Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1663&>, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win over San Diego, but he did score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantasy player, however, and is no better than a reserve used only when the matchup is right. 

Kevin Johnson <http://fo! ot! ball215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=133324&>, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Johnson caught eight passes for 153 yards and a TD against the Bengals. It appears the Cleveland wideout is starting to re-emerge as a quality Fantasy player.

Tom Brady <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=187741&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Brady had his first impressive outing on Sunday, throwing for 364 yards and two touchdowns in the Patriots' 29-26 overtime win over San Diego. Despite the great performace, Brady is still not worth anything more than a reserve spot Fantasy-wise. 

James Jackson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=235220&>, R! B ! CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Jackson played against Cincinnati, but was limited to only 22 rushing yards on 14 carries. The rookie running back, who played despite some rib problems, has been inconsistent and unreliable so far.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=235249&>, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/14/01
Tomlinson's yardage numbers (87 total) were subpar by his standards, but he did score another touchdown for San Diego. He's one of the top tailbacks in the league and should be a weekly starter Fantasy-wise. 

Doug Flutie <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=12375&>, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/14/01
Flutie had a s! ol! id game on Sunday, posting 270 yards passing and a touchdown against New England. He's still not worth starting every week, but is better of used when the matchup is right. 

Justin McCareins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=235117&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
McCareins started in place of the injured Derrick Mason on Sunday against Tampa Bay. He did have two catches for 70 yards in the game, but still warrants very little Fantasy consideration. 

Donald Hayes <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Hayes caught seven passes for 44 yards against the Saints. If opponents continue to pay extra attention to Muhsin Muhammad, Hayes might continue to post some respectable numbers.

Eddie George <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.c! om! /mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4527&key=1174&> , RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
George had his best Fantasy game of the season, posting 132 yards of total offense and a score against Tampa Bay. The performance brings a sigh of relief from Fantasy owners worried that George had lost a step after offseason toe surgery.

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI 

I am stuck on my last starter. Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season. 

Answer - GG 

Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems. 


Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA 

Should I start Rod Gardner or Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is looking better each week. 

Answer - GG 

Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants' No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with Hilliard because of his experience and continuing improvement. 


Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO 

I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson? 

Answer - GG 

Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with the hotter player, and that would be Thomas. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

Subject: Dear Abby.......



Dear  Abby , 
I met Laurie at a singles dance.  I knew as soon as I looked at her that she 
was too young for me. I'm 49 and she was 32 , 17 years my junior. I really 
regretted it because we got along so well that evening. She made me feel so 
comfortable in her presence.  Our age difference didn't seem to matter to 
her as much as it did to me. 
Abby, I told her I felt people were staring at us.  I said they are probably 
wondering if I am your father.  She thought I was being silly and said if I 
wanted to see her again she would be honored to go out with me. 
Laurie and I have been dating now for three months.  I really like her and I 
think she likes me.  Still, everywhere we go, I feel people watching us. 
Sometimes they just outright stare.  It is very annoying and I know it is 
because of our age difference that draws these prolonged looks from everyone 
we meet.  I just feel so uncomfortable about this whole thing and wonder if 
I should continue with the relationship. Why do people have to be so 
rude....? 
Sincerely, 
John 
PS: I have attached a picture of Laurie.

It's just 3 of us right now.  Me, Natalie, and Lorena.  I think Natalie's friend, Jeff, might be joining us as well.  I know we all talked about not drinking and driving so the limo is a great idea.  I'll mention it to them.  We all have costumes.  Are you still planning to dress up as me??

Subject: RE: 

I was thinking of renting a Limo ($70.00/hr), so we don't have to drive.  But, everybody that was thinking of going with me is backing out.  What do you think?  I want to drink but I don't want to drive.  How many girlfriends do you have going.  Oh by the way my costume is very weak.

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01

start this weekend's game against Washington.

McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the

 Packers, DT GB - Uran Man Updated 11/19/01
Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during
Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against
Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to
day. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/19/01
Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes
for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game,
however, and is listed as day to day. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to
return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more
weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate
Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value
in the offseason. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/19/01
Jackson told the <i>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i> it was a coach's decision
not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle
injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able
to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantasy value
might drop greatly.

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the <I>Dallas Morning
News</I> is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for
the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy
Football. 

Kevin Lockett, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib
injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain
at this time. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told
the <I>Washington Post</I> that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would
be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham
would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive
Fantasy option against the Eagles. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/19/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee.
However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas faces
Denver on Thanksgiving Day. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against
Arizona. He is listed as day to day.

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did
not return to the game, and is listed as day to day. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/19/01
Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is
listed as day to day. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His
status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins.
Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent
Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary
will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing
defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open
often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit.
Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better
game this season.

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23
carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very
thin at RB..

David Sloan, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you
are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks
from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64
yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs
and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for
the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for
only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good
Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is
also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to
get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless
your team is very thin at wideout.

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is
not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his
third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player
you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year
receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards
and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks,
however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for
the entire preseason. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While
he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for
Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98
yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is
becoming somewhat of a gamble. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has
not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and
four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the
league and is a must-start every week. 

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and
three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every-week starter
in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers
when the matchup is right. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at
Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was
intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play
in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-start
every week.

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay
wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs and two
interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green
Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes a good
backup RB right now.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/18/01
Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the
Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should
not start for most Fantasy teams.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie
is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some
occasional TDs down the stretch. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/18/01
Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at
Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup
right now.

Benjamin Gay, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 times
for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and lateral
quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White
shared carries in his place. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith
appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless
you lack depth at RB.

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
The rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets.
Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/18/01
Moss made his pro debut on Sunday, but did not catch a pass and was stopped
for a six-yard loss on his one carry. The rookie has missed too much time
to make a Fantasy impact this season. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Huntley actually had a good outing against San Francisco, posting 94
scrimmage yards and a touchdown. However, he's far too inconsistent to
start on a weekly basis. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
Weinke started Sunday's game against San Francisco after missing last
week's game due to a shoulder injury. He put up decent numbers, throwing
for 177 yards and two touchdowns in Carolina's 25-22 OT loss. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Chrebet did not catch a pass at Miami. The Jets' wideout is no longer
worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Hearst had another strong game, posting 113 scrimmage yards against
Carolina. His comeback from a serious ankle condition is nothing short of
miraculous, and he's actually been a reliable Fantasy player over the last
two weeks. 

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Van Pelt threw for 316 yards, two TDs and no interceptions against the
Seahawks. He did lose a fumble, but Van Pelt got solid protection for most
of the game and will be a respectable Fantasy backup while he fills in for
the injured Rob Johnson.

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/18/01
Garcia had another huge game, posting 305 yards and three touchdowns
against Carolina. He's been one of the top three Fantasy quarterbacks this
season, and may even be more valuable than Peyton Manning at this point. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Price caught 10 passes for 138 yards and a TD against Seattle. He has
clearly become Buffalo's best Fantasy player this season.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Hasselbeck threw for 134 yards, one TD and no interceptions at Buffalo. The
Seattle QB is making less mistakes, yet he doesn't help Fantasy teams much,
either.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/18/01
Kitna put up 234 yards passing and a touchdown against Tennessee, but two
interceptions made his performance mediocre. He's no better than a reserve
Fantasy player at this point, best used when the matchup is right in a
deeper league. 

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Robinson caught two passes for 15 yards at Buffalo, including his first
career TD, a seven-yarder. Robinson is slowly improving, but still does not
produce enough to be a reliable Fantasy player.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/18/01
Dillon was held in check by Tennessee, rushing for only 38 yards on Sunday.
However, with all the injured running backs around the league this season,
Dillon is still a must-start on a weekly basis. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
McNair played despite a sore thumb, throwing for 172 yards and a touchdown
against Cincinnati. He's been an unreliable Fantasy player this season, and
is worth starting only when the matchup is right. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 11/18/01
George was unimpressive once again, posting only 65 scrimmage yards on
Sunday against Cincinnati. He just doesn't seem to be at full speed this
season, and has been a huge Fantasy disappointment. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Williams had a big game on Sunday, rushing for 120 yards and a touchdown
against Indianapolis. He continues to prove his value as a Fantasy player,
and is a must-start ever week. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/18/01
Brooks had an outstanding game against Indianapolis, throwing for 249 yards
and two touchdowns. He's put together two straight solid games, and may
finally be reaching the potential the coaching staff knew he was capable
of. 

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Manning put up a decent performance against New Orleans, posting 262 yards
and a touchdown. He may not be putting up Manning-like numbers this season,
but he's still far too valuable to ever consider benching. 

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/18/01
Pollard had a huge game on Sunday, catching three passes for 126 yards and
a touchdown against New Orleans. He may not be the most consistent Fantasy
player, but the lack of tight end depth around the league makes him a
valuable commodity. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 11/18/01
McNabb was unimpressive on Sunday, compiling only 153 scrimmage yards and a
touchdown against Dallas. Despite the mediocre performance, McNabb is still
one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Leaf was horrible for the second straight week, throwing for only 102 yards
with two interceptions. Incidently, both picks were returned for touchdowns
as Dallas fell to Philadelphia, 36-3. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/18/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia in the second half with an
apparent knee injury. He did not return to the game, and finished the day
with 90 scrimmage yards and a fumble. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) did not start in Sunday's game. Jamel White started against
the Ravens. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/18/01
McNair will start Sunday's game against Cincinnati as long after taking
pre-game snaps without any problems. McNair, who is dealing with a thumb
injury, isn't worth starting on your Fantasy team outside of deeper
leagues. 

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/18/01
Green (abdominal strain) is out for Sunday's game. Reidel Anthony will
start in his absence.

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/18/01
Stewart (ankle) is out for Sunday's game against Arizona. However, coach
Marty Mornhinweg stated that Stewart is making progress, and is getting
closer to returning to action. 

Marco Battaglia, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Battaglia (appendectomy) is out at least a month, and may miss the rest of
the season. The big tight end has no real value as a Fantasy player. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 11/18/01
Brunell (quadriceps) will start on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He'll be
facing a tough Steelers' secondary at less than 100 percent, however, so
Fantasy owners may want to consider benching him in Week 10. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 11/18/01
Taylor (groin) practiced without incident on Friday, but he still needs
medical clearance before he can play in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.
Even is he is able to play, however, he'd only be used on a limited basis.
Stacey Mack will get the start in any event, so playing Taylor on your
Fantasy team is not a wise move. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/18/01
Pathon (foot) is out for Sunday's game against New Orleans, according to
the <I>Indianapolis Star</I>. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon's place
once again. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) will likely be a gametime decison on Sunday against
Baltimore. If the rookie tailback is unable to play, Jamel White will be
Cleveland's featured back with Benjamin Gay getting some looks in the
backfield as well. 

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/17/01
Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is
one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will
likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.

Jamal Lewis, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01
According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games.
Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be
allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until
Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in
Tennessee. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner
will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in
goal-line situations.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of
Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a
Fantasy perspective.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati
due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills
Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not
being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/16/01
Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing
two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said
after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of
the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't
recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/16/01
Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now
listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit. However, if
you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week,
Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth
considering as long as he's able to play. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for
Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on
your Fantasy team. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/16/01
Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of
consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better
quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in
your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good
to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end
zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the
Giants' secondary on Monday night. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 11/16/01
Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to
an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost
impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy
numbers. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good
player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that
has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/16/01
Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347
yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his
potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially
against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/16/01
Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11
catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis
squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this
week is a solid option. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's
averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again
emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10
against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three
games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can
be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep
Fantasy leagues. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/16/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three
touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this
weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is
worth considering. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/16/01
Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three
passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against
Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/16/01
Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your
Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a
tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of
deeper leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/16/01
Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored
only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary
this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on
his potential to put up solid numbers. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/16/01
Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one
of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the
formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on
his potential for big numbers.

*************************************************
INSIDER'S TIP

Avoid the four o'clock traffic congestion in Breckenridge by
sticking around for a while. Relax and have a cup of coffee or
a bite to eat before leaving town so you can miss the end of
the day rush.  You can take the Main Street Express Shuttle
from the parking lots for your free ride to historic Main Street.
The Main Street Express runs Thursday-Sunday from
approximately 2:30-7:30pm and picks up every 7.5 minutes
to take guests to and from the downtown area.

"FW: Wyoming Interstate Company (WIC) Maintenance","
Paul, 
I talked to Adele this morning and she is still fairly clueless.  She would not commit to an answer as to how our capacity will be affected.  She did say that firm transports would be the last to be cut and their cuts would then be pro-rata.  Any ideas on who could provide a better answer for us?
Thanks,
Shelly

Jackie, Shelly,
 
Would you call Adele and see if and/or how much our Medicine Bow capacity will be affected for the 30th?
We will have to make sure and sell the difference at Glenrock into KN.

One unit at the Douglas Station on WIC will be out of service October 30, 2001 for approximately 8 hours.  Throughput for this period will be reduced to a rate of about 360 MMcf/d with a total daily throughput estimated at 450 MMCf/d.  

As this will directly effect all gas coming out of the Powder River, please contact your marketer directly as to how much gas they will be able to deliver into WIC on that day.  Allocations will be based on WIC allocation methods.

Latest NFL Player News

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Horn will have another disappointing game this week. Rams CB Aeneas
Williams will probably draw him in coverage and nuetralize him for long
periods.

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
Brooks won't post huge yardage totals against the Rams. The St. Louis
secondary will use its good speed to take away the deep pass.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Davis won't be a major factor against the Giants. New York will look to
stuff the run early on, and will force Tony Banks to the air, as the
Giants' defense dictates the flow of the game.

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Holt should have a good second half against the Saints. He should
eventually wear CB Fred Thomas out, and Holt will be a key receiver late in
the game.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Canidate will start in place of the injured Marshall Faulk again this week.
His numbers won't be overwhelming against the solid Saints defense.

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Warner is always a good start, but he may feel some extra pressure this
week. New Orleans' front seven will try to disrupt his timing as often as
possible.

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Ismail has developed into a good all-around receiver. He is definitely
worth a start against the inconsistent Jaguars secondary.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Taylor has been inconsistent this year, yet he has a good matchup this
week. Jacksonville's pass defense is erratic and may let Taylor get in the
end zone for a score.

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Walls will get a lot of important looks this week. The Panthers should move
the ball rather well against the Jets, and Walls may be open for TD catches
near the goal line.

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Hayes will definitely be a TD threat this week. The Jets' defense gives up
a lot of yardage, and Hayes will certainly get chances to score in the red
zone.

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Muhammad should have a good game againt the Jets. New York's defense is
definitely vulnerable to big-play wideouts.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Smith should be good for at least one TD this week. The Patriots should
move the ball well against Denver.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
Brady may have another good game this week. Denver's pass defense is very
vulnerable, and Brady is looking good at the helm of the New England
offense.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Gannon will have trouble moving the ball against a tough Eagles defense but
should still find a way to score a touchdown. Look for him to either throw
a TD pass or get a rushing score. 

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Rice will catch some passes this week but don't expect him to score a
touchdown. The Eagles have one of the top pass defenses in the NFL and have
only allowed five TD passes all season. 

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
Brown faces a formidable Eagles secondary but should have a good game. He
has done well against NFC opponents recently. Brown has 20 receptions and
three touchdowns in his last four games against the NFC. 

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Howard will have a major role in the passing attack now that receivers
Herman Moore and Germane Crowell are out for the season. Howard might not
catch a lot of passes this week but should score a touchdown. He has
exceptional breakaway speed. We still wouldn't advise starting him yet.
Howard must first prove that he can be a reliable wideout.

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Stewart is expected to play on Sunday. His ankle injury was originally
diagnosed as a sprain, but is now being classified as a bruise. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Morton should have a solid game against the Bengals this week. The
Cincinnati secondary has been adequate at best this season and has given up
eight touchdown passes.

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
Martin had scored a touchdown in each of his first five games until the
Jets shut him out Sunday. Look for Martin to rebound and have a good game
this week against the Panthers. Carolina has one of the worst run defenses
in the NFL. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Coles will be the primary receiver this week, replacing the injured Wayne
Chrebet. Coles has played well in recent weeks. Expect him to catch a lot
of passes and score a touchdown. 

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Robinson won't challenge the Miami secondary this week. The rookie receiver
has been a Fantasy disappointment so far.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Brunell has been an adequate starter but will have a tough matchup against
the Ravens. Baltimore has struggled against the pass in recent weeks but we
wouldn't advise using Brunell. He doesn't have enough talent at receiver to
post good numbers against Baltimore. 

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
Jackson won't do much against the Dolphins. CB Sam Madison will keep him
quiet throughout Sunday's game.

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Alexander may have his first disappointing outing of the year. Miami's
defense will be geared to stopping the run, and will strive to contain
Alexander and force Matt Hasselbeck to throw often.

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
McCardell struggled in the first few games as he made his way back from
injury, but has begun to look like his old self in the previous game.
Expect McCardell to be a solid No. 2 receiver this week. 

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Stewart may throw a TD pass against the vulnerable Tennessee secondary, but
he may also see a lot of blitzes. Turnovers and rushed passes may hurt his
overall numbers.

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Brady has been a disappointment so far this season. He didn't have high
expectations coming into the season, but many expected him to have more
than the eight receptions and a touchdown this season. Don't expect him to
be productive this week. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Mason has been a disappointment so far because of injuries. He might get
deep once or twice against Pittsburgh, but his overall numbers won't be
impressive.

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Look for Smith to be a solid No. 2 receiver this week. He has struggled to
score in recent games. Smith has caught a lot of passes this season but
hasn't had a touchdown since Week One. 

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Chamberlain won't have a very productive day against the Buccaneers. He
won't see a lot of receiving room over the middle.

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Carter should be good for at least one TD catch against Tampa Bay. He will
give CB Donnie Abraham a lot of trouble.

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Culpepper might have to carry the offense against Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers
will crack down on the run early, and Culpepper will have to scramble or
throw into tight coverages. He may turn the ball over more than once.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Barber will likely be used mostly on third downs. He has taken a lesser
role in the running game this season and is not worth starting right now. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Expect Dayne to have a big game this week against the Redskins. Washington
has one of the worst run defenses in football. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Collins has been inconsistent this season but should throw at least one
touchdown pass this week against the Redskins. Washington has one of the
worst defenses in the NFL. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Staley is recovering from a shoulder injury but is expected to play in
Sunday's game against the Raiders, despite being listed as probable. Don't
expect him to gain a lot of yards. The Raiders have one of the best run
defenses.

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Expect McNabb to have another good game this week. The Raiders have had
trouble containing mobile quarterbacks in the past few years. McNabb should
score with either a touchdown run or pass. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Lewis should catch an adequate amount of passes this week. The Raiders will
have good coverage on the Philadelphia receivers but Lewis will manage to
slip through the coverage. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Thrash to be too productive this week. He has been
inconsistent this season and faces one of the top secondaries. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He
managed to practice Thursday after sitting out Wednesday's practice. Look
for Pinkston to be an adequate second Fantasy receiver this week. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Smith has a leg injury but is expected to play this week. He is listed as
probable on the injury report. Expect Smith to overcome his injury and be a
solid Fantasy back this week. 

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Fiedler has thrown a decent amount of TD passes this season, but he has
also thrown a lot of interceptions. Look for him to throw a TD pass and at
least one interception this week. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
McKnight has been inconsistent this season but should catch some passes
against the Seahawks. Expect him to be an adequate No. 2 receiver for your
squad. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Gadsden should catch a few passes this week. The Seahawks have had trouble
stopping the pass this season. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Smith should have some success against the Cardinals this week. Arizona has
allowed an average of 138.6 yards per game. Expect Smith to gain at least
85 yards and score a touchdown. 

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Tomlinson should have a big game this week against an inadequate Buffalo
run defense. Tomlinson has been an effective runner so far while the Bills
have allowed an average of 138.6 yards per game. 

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Fluite will be productive but don't expect him to throw a lot of touchdown
passes Sunday against the Bills. San Diego will have so much success
running the ball that they won't need Flutie to throw. 

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Conway to be too productive this week. He has been mediocre as
the Chargers' primary receiver scoring two touchdowns and catching 20
passes in six games. He will be a good No. 2 receiver at best. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Graham should catch some passes against the Bills this week but don't
expect him to score a touchdown. He's still not reliable enough to start on
a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Pittman had 95 yards rushing last week against the Chiefs. The Cowboys'
defense is a bit tougher than the Chiefs, but Pittman should still be
productive. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 back this week. 

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Plummer has been an adequate passer all season. He should continue that
trend this week against the Cowboys, who have a mediocre pass rush. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Sanders has struggled this season but should play better against Dallas
this week. The Arizona offensive line will give QB Jake Plummer good
protection and allow Sanders a lot of time to get open. Expect him to catch
some passes and score a touchdown. 

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Look for Boston to play well against the Cowboys Sunday. Dallas has an
inexperinced secondary while Boston is emerging as a premier receiver. 

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Expect Johnson to be accurate this week but he will probably have a hard
time throwing TD passes. Johnson has played better in recent weeks but his
top two receivers are suffering from injuries. 

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Anderson has struggled lately but should rebound against the Patriots this
week. Expect him to gain at least 80 yards this week and run for a
touchdown. The Patriots have given up five rushing TDs this season. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Griese is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Patriots because
of a lingering shoulder injury. Look for him to play through the injury and
throw at least one touchdown pass. Griese won't dominate but he will be a
solid starting QB this week. 

Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Kennison to do well this week. He only has 13 catches and a
touchdown in five starts this season.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Dillon was limited to just 30 yards rushing by the Bears last week but
should be more productive this week. He is facing a Lions defense that has
allowed an average of 131.8 yards in five games. Look for Dillon to gain a
good amount of yards and score a touchdown. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Kitna failed to throw a TD pass last week but expect him to toss a few
against the Lions this week. Detroit has given up 10 TD passes in five
games this season. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Warrick should catch a lot of passes this week but don't expect him to
score a touchdown. He has just one TD reception in six games.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Scott has struggled this season, but look for him to catch some passes this
week against a struggling Lions secondary. He should be an adequate No. 3
wideout this week in leagues that start three receivers. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Terrell had a breakthrough performance last week catching a season-high
seven passes for 91 yards. Look for him to continue to catch passes this
week against the 49ers and possibly score his first touchdown. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
Miller's pass protection will give him an adequate amount of time to throw
the ball this week against the mediocre San Francisco pass rush. Look for
Miller to unleash passes all over the field and accumulate Fantasy points. 

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Booker should once again be a good starting receiver this week. He is the
Bears' top receiving option now that Marcus Robinson is out for the season
and faces a 49ers defense that has allowed six TD receptions in five games. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Garcia will find it difficult to move the ball against the Bears' defense
but he should still find a way to be productive. Look for him to score a
touchdown either by running it in or throwing the ball.

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Hearst has been effective this season, but not very explosive. Look for him
to struggle against the stingy Bears defense this week. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Owens set the record for most receptions in a game the last time he played
the Bears. He won't be as effective this week, but will be a productive
receiver. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
Stokes has been nursing sore legs and might not be at full strength for
Sunday's game. He has struggled when healthy so don't expect him to score a
lot of points this week.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Henry should be able to gain between 70-90 yards against the Chargers but
he will have a tough time scoring a touchdown. San Diego has only allowed
two rushing TDs this season. 

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Johnson has not thrown a lot of TD passes this season, totaling just three
in five games. It will be difficult for him to throw the ball effectively
against the Chargers so don't rely on him for a lot of Fantasy points.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Look for Centers to have a big game this season. He is the Bills leading
receiver this season with 35 receptions. Expect him to catch a lot of
passes this week and be a solid No. 2 back. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Price to be too productive this week. He only has nine catches
this season.

Jay Riemersma, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Riemersma should catch a few passes this week but don't expect him to score
a TD. He lacks the speed to break away for a long reception and hasn't been
getting too many looks inside the red zone. 

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Moulds suffered a minor leg injury in practice Thursday but is expected to
play Sunday. Look for Moulds to catch several passes and score a touchdown.
He has caught a TD pass in each of the last two games. 

Terry Kirby, RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Kirby might be activated for the first time this season, according to
<i>The Contra Costa Times</i>. The Raiders plan to use him if Tyrone
Wheatley is unable to play. But don't expect Kirby to get a lot of touches.
Oakland will likely rely on Charlie Garner instead. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
Wheatley missed practice again on Thursday because of wrist and knee
injuries. He remains questionable for Sunday's game. Terry Kirby will
replace him in the rotation if he is unable to play. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Jones, recovering from a shoulder injury, returned to practice Thursday. He
might remains questionable for this week's game but might see some action. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Sharpe has been downgraded on the injury report from probable to
questionable. He has been limited in practice all week because of a leg
injury. Rookie Todd Heap might get a lot of looks on offense but he is also
recovering from injury. The Ravens may be forced to use tight end John
Jones. 

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Wilkins missed Thursday's game at Kansas City. He was held out of the
lineup because of broken ribs. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Pathon missed his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a
sprained right foot. He was replaced by rookie Reggie Wayne in the starting
lineup. 

Drew Bledsoe, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
It doesn't appear that Bledsoe will be used as an emergency QB Sunday, but
<i>The Boston Herald</i> reports that doctors will make a decision on
whether on not to increase his workload. Bledsoe has thrown 75 passes in
the past two days without experiencing any adverse affects. 

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Joseph might replace Stacey Mack as the starting back this Sunday,
according to <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. Mack has made two critical
mistakes in the past two games. Joseph has been getting a lot of carries
this week and has already been slated to be the third-down back. We
wouldn't advise using either player this week if you already have two solid
backs. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Mack might be replaced in the starting lineup by rookie Elvis Joseph,
according to <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. The Jaguars are reportedly
looking to use Joseph because of the mistakes Mack has made in the past two
games. Consider reserving Mack this week. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Galloway was limited in practice once again Thursday because of a foot
injury. <i>The Dallas Morning News</i> reports that he will be a gametime
decision. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Swinton practiced Thursday an is expected to play Sunday, according to
<i>The Dallas Morning News</i>. Swinton had been limited for most of the
week because of a hamstring injury. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Bennett to return to the starting lineup soon. He is listed as
questionable on the injury report but probably won't return until after the
Vikings' bye in Week Eight. 

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Green was limited in practice Thursday because of a groin injury. He
remains questionable for Sunday's game and will be re-evaluated on
Saturday. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Dunn was limited in practice Thursday because of his hamstring injury and
remains questionable for Sunday's game. He will be re-evaluated on
Saturday. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Johnson was upgraded from questionable to probable Thursday. He is
suffering from hip and thigh injuries but was able to run for the second
consecutive day. Johnson is expected to play in Sunday's game. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Ward (ankle) was limited in practice Thursday, according to <i>The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>. He is still expected to play in Monday's game
against Tennessee. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
The Patriots will reportedly bench Glenn once again this week if he doesn't
show any improvement in practice Friday. Glenn is suffering from a
hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game. 

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Smith is listed as probable on the injury report. He is suffering from an
ankle injury but is expected to start Sunday's game against New England. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Weinke is suffering from a hip injury but is expected to start Sunday's
game. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Matthews is suffering from sore ribs but is expected to be the No. 2 QB
Sunday. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Allen practiced Wednesday but was too sore to work out Thursday. He remains
questionable for Sunday's game but <i>The Washington Post</i> claims that
it is almost certain Allen will be replaced by Jason Brookins. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Not only is Wright out for the season, he might need season-ending surgery
to repair his damaged knee. An MRI showed that he damaged the same ACL that
was repaired in five years ago. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Head coach Mike Martz has ruled Faulk out for Sunday's game, according to
<i>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>. Faulk is still recovering from a
bruised knee so Trung Canidate will replace him as the starting running
back once again. 

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Bothered by soreness in his lower left leg and five weeks removed from
surgery on his right knee, Davis practiced with the Broncos Thursday but
remained questionable for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots.
""Hopefully there's no setback today and he just keeps on getting better and
better,"" Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ""I anticipate or I'm hoping for
the Monday night game [Nov. 5] there will be no setback this week, and
he'll be ready to go."" Shanahan did not rule Davis out for Sunday's game,
but a Nov. 5 return seems more likely. Even if Davis does play this Sunday,
Mike Anderson will probably get most of the carries. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Jeffers, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during in
a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2000, said he's been
told by the coaching staff that he'll be activated Sunday for the first
time this season. ""They said it looks like I'll be up, so I'm preparing
like I will be,"" Jeffers said. ""I'm excited. It's another step along the
way."" However, the Panthers may delay his return if injured receiver Steve
Smith is able to play. Keep Jeffers reserved for now. He will see limited
action if plays.

E Source teleconferences on retail markets and industry restructuring
Join us for two informative teleconferences designed to help you respond to highly volatile retail energy markets and shifting corporate imperatives. 
Please forward this e-mail to colleagues in other departments who might be interested in participating. Sign up by replying to this e-mail with the appropriate information completed below.

""Creating a Vibrant Retail Electricity Market"" 
Tuesday, October 30, 2001, at 10 am (MST), 12 noon (EST)
What key findings have marketing practitioners and restructuring architects gleaned from retail energy markets that have opened to date? If currently closed markets are to open successfully, what critical elements must be in place? Which stumbling blocks need to be removed? E Source has convened a panel of experienced players to distill what can be learned from recently opened markets and offer advice for incorporating these lessons into your strategic and marketing planning. The panel will include:
  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/telecon%20bullet.gif>
 
Karen O'Neill, Vice President of New Markets, Green Mountain Energy
 
 
 
  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/telecon%20bullet.gif>
 
John Hanger, CEO of Penn Future and former Commissioner with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission
 
 
 
  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/telecon%20bullet.gif>
 
Joe Douglas, Marketing Manager with npower direct, one of the largest retail energy suppliers in the United Kingdom
 
 
 

""Is it Possible to Restructure Retail Electric Markets?""
Tuesday, November 6, 2001, at 10 am (MST), 12 Noon (EST)
The catastrophic failure of California's restructuring efforts, coupled with extremely low switching rates in overseas and various U.S. state markets, raises anew the debate over whether it is even possible to restructure retail electric markets. Is there something fundamentally different about electric markets that render them impossible to open? Over the past quarter-century, numerous once-regulated industries, such as financial services, airlines, and telecommunications, have been successfully restructured. Why is electricity an outlier? Will it change?
Two distinguished industry analysts, Ken Malloy, CEO of the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets and publisher of the RED Index, and Dr. Mark Cooper, Director of Research for Consumer Federation of America, will debate two interrelated propositions: 
1. All retail customers should be required to choose a new energy supplier.
2. Non-commodity products--such as demand-side management, distributed generation, green power, and combined heat and power--will penetrate faster and more deeply in open retail markets than they would under the continuation of traditional regulation.

I plan to continue my normal schedule of working 6am to 4pm which coincides with noramal Houston hours, covers spot gas trading, covers spot power trading and overlaps with most of my customers hours in the west.  When necessary I will come in early or stay late.  Please let me know if there are any issues there.

Subject:	Work Hours

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

        <b>ALL-NEW iTax&#153; Has Everything You Need to File Your Taxes!  And it's FREE!</b><br><br>
        As a Go Daddy Software customer, you are aware of our philosophy to provide high-quality products at affordable prices.  Bob Parsons, our founder, had the same philosophy when he owned Parsons Technology, where he pioneered low-cost, high-quality tax software.<br><br>
        On or before January 15th Go Daddy will launch an all-new product, iTax.  iTax is incredible new online tax preparation software that functions faster and <a href=""http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/itax_tell.asp?isc=gdtaxps&display=chart"">better than the other online tax products</a>.  iTax is built with state-of-the-art Microsoft .NET technology to provide a fast, efficient and feature-rich way to complete your 2001 income tax return.<br><br>
        Just look at what you get with iTax (and you get it for FREE!):
        <ul>
        <li><b>It's fast</b> ? An easy-to-use expert interview will guide you seamlessly through the process of completing your tax return in just minutes!</li>
        <li><b>It's easy</b> ? There's no filtering through reams of IRS instructions, no calculators and no headaches.  It's all on line!</li>
        <li><b>It's complete</b> ? You get everything you need.  All the important forms and schedules.  Nothing is held back.  No tricks.  No gimmicks.  It's chock full of deluxe features (like context sensitive help from J.K. Lasser & the IRS, and even tools to help you avoid an audit!).</li>
        <li><b>It's direct</b>  ? Print your return for free or eFile your tax return & speed up your refund (even arrange to pay your taxes at the last possible moment) for only $7.95. Match that deal anywhere!</li>
        <li><b>It's secure</b> ? Your tax return will be protected using a VeriSign Secure Certificate, a double dose of encryption and password protection.</li>
        <li><b>It's 100% guaranteed</b> ? If there is an error in your return as a result of a computational error in iTax, Go Daddy will pay the penalty.</li>
        <li><b>And, of course, it's FREE!</b></li>
        </ul>
        Why are we doing this?  What's the catch?  As you know Go Daddy Software is not a non-profit organization.  So how do we make money?  It's simple.  We're banking on the fact that many customers will eFile their tax return and the small margin we make on the processing charge will carry the day.  And because it's a smokin' deal you will tell your friends, and come back year after year.<br><br>
        <b>So what are you waiting for?</b>  Click on the button below to be notified when iTax is ready!<br><br>

We're meeting at Nat's place in the early evening to ""get ready"" and then planning to hit the bars and maybe a couple of parties.  Are you going to join us?   Do you know of anything going on?

Latest NFL Player News

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Jeffers hopes to return to the field for the first time in 14 months when
the Panthers play host the New York Jets on Sunday. Jeffers, who tore the
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during in a preseason game
against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2000, said he's been told by the
coaching staff that he'll be activated Sunday for the first time this
season. ""They said it looks like I'll be up, so I'm preparing like I will
be,"" Jeffers said. ""I'm excited. It's another step along the way."" Keep
Jeffers reserved for now. He will see limited action if plays. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Leaf will be the Cowboys' backup QB Sunday. Clint Stoerner has been named
the starter in place of the injured Anthony Wright. 

Clint Stoerner, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Stoerner will start at quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys against Arizona
on Sunday, replacing Anthony Wright, who is out with a chronic sprained
knee and could face season-ending surgery. We wouldn't advise using
Stoerner as the starting QB on your Fantasy squad. He has played just three
games in his two seasons with Dallas, but was 4-of-7 for 44 yards and two
touchdowns against Philadelphia this year. Ryan Leaf will be the No. 2
quarterback for Dallas. 

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
James hyperextended his left knee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game
at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who
scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the
sidelines after leaving the game but said his knee should be fine for the
Colts' next game on November 4. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/25/01
Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs.
Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most
of the work in two receiver sets.

James Hodgins, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's
game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if
he is healthy. 

Dave Stachelski, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this
season for five yards. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the
injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should
reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any
indication that he will use Bennett this week. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars.
However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable
on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/25/01
Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf
toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as
probable on the injury report. 

Kevin Swayne, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet.
Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be
re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy
value if he is healthy. 

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle. He is still recovering
from a foot injury. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/25/01
Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game,
according to <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>. Jason Brookins will start Sunday if
Allen is inactive. 

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday.
He might actually start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen.
Nevertheless, he is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01
Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday's
game. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/25/01
Jones has a sprained ankle but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is
listed as questionable on the injury report. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Ward missed practice Wednesday because of a foot injury but is expected to
play in Sunday's game. He is listed on the injury report as probable. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Galloway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's
practice. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the
Cowboys' previous game. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However,
<i>The Detroit Free Press</i> reports that he is still expected to play
Sunday against the Bengals. 

O.J. McDuffie, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The <i>Miami Herald</i>
reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired
toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury. 

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out because of
broken ribs. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/25/01
Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a
sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting
lineup. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/25/01
Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to <i>The Boston
Globe</i>. He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is
still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how
his leg holds up before activating him Sunday. 

Drew Bledsoe, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
<i>The Boston Globe</i> reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe
might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still
under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual
passing drills. 

Chad Morton, RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to <i>The Bergen
Record</i>. He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain. 

Marco Battaglia, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury
but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit. 

Chad Johnson, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but
<i>The Cincinnati Enquirer</i> reports that he will be sidelined for
several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his
absence. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday,
according to <i>The Nashville Tennessean</i>. However, Sanders is used as a
third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if
he is healthy. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/25/01
Wheatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries,
but head coach Jon Gruden told <i>The Contra Costa Times</i> that he is
making progress. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the
Eagles. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01
Johnson ran in the morning and afternoon but did not practice Wednesday,
according to <i>The St. Petersburg Times</i>. Johnson is recovering from
hip and thigh injuries but is expected to play Sunday. 

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/25/01
Green is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Minnesota. He is
recovering from a groin strain. Frank Murphy will replace Green at receiver
if he is unable to play. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/25/01
Dunn participated in running drills Wednesday and did not have any setbacks
in his recovery from a toe injury, according to <i>The St. Petersburg
Times</i>. Nevertheless, Dunn is still listed as questionable for this
week's game against Minnesota. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/25/01
Hillard is suffering from soreness in his surgically-repaired foot,
according to the <i>New York Newsday</i>. The foot was sore following the
Giants game against St. Louis in Week Five but it is even more sore now.
Keep an eye on this situation. This condition might force Hilliard to the
sidelines if it intensifies. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Jones' status for this week's game is questionable, according to <i>The
Florida Times-Union</i>. He missed practice on Wednesday because of a
shoulder injury. Kyle Brady will get most of the looks at tight end if
Jones is unable to play. 

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Joseph took a lot of snaps in practice Wednesday and will be incorporated
in as the third-down back, according to <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>.
Joseph won't have much value in this job but he will take carries away from
starter Stacey Mack. 

Tyrone Davis, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Davis could return from his hamstring injury sooner than what was
originally expected, according to published reports. He might begin
practicing next week and will almost certainly be activated before his
target date of Thanksgiving. Davis has been sidelined since August because
of hamstring surgery. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/25/01
Grbac will likely be a game-time decision for Sunday's game, according to
<i>The Baltimore Sun</i>. He threw very little in practice and is still
suffering from a sore chest. Randall Cunningham will start if Grbac is
unable to play. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Moss is suffering from tendonitis in his left Achilles tendon, according to
<i>The Pioneer Press</i>. Moss missed practice Wednesday but is expected to
play on Sunday. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/25/01
Martin might be ready to play when the Falcons resume their season on
November 4. He has been sidelined for the past four games because of a
broken collarbone but the <i>Atlanta Journal-constitution</i> reports that
he ran routes on Wednesday and caught some passes. 

Wane McGarity, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
The Saints have signed McGarity, who was released by the Cowboys earlier
this season. McGarity will be used mostly on returns, but he might
eventually work his way into the Saints' regular rotation of receivers. 

Matt Stover, K BAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he
will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The
injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve
Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. 

Eric Metcalf, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
The Washington Redskins signed Metcalf on Wednesday. He will be used mostly
as a returner and has minimal Fantasy value. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and
other structural damage to his right foot. ""He's not going to be really
ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,""
coach George Seifert said Wednesday. ""Basically, it just separated,""
Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. ""The ligaments, tendons
and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together."" Richard Huntley,
who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate
at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he
expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01
Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The <i>Detroit
Free Press</i> reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a
bad bruise and not a sprain. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/25/01
Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at
Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams'
defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of
dizziness. It was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked
Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second
half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as
""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the
injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was
given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie
Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup. 

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and
could be lost for the season. ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to
play this Sunday,"" Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year
and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has
been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained
on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game
against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the
weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be
limited if he does play Sunday. 

Clint Stoerner, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of
fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo
said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to
play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move.
Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL.
He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards
and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and
coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday. Wright expected to
have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a
final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game
until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf
if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance
that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been
with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet. 

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01
Davis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg
is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week.
X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the <i>Denver Post</i>, but Davis'
leg is throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If
Davis is able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited.

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/24/01
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe
Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer
caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a
reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last
season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach
Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and
said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet
passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced
by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League
and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40
straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after
receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are
looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending
injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job.
Don't bother picking him up.

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for
Monday's game against Tennessee.

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/24/01
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn
patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
The New York <i>Daily News</i> says there is still a noticeable hitch in
Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect
him to return is Dec. 2.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on
the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting
lineup. But the <i>Kansas City Star</i> notes Chris Thomas is still working
with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player
will start on Thursday against the Colts.

Larry Foster, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 10/24/01
According to the <I>Detroit Free Press</I>, Foster is expected to start in
Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an
inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right
now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments
in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play
in a keeper league.

Neil Rackers, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
According to the <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i>, the Bengals worked out three
kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is
a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/24/01
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He
will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress
in his recovery and might play this week.

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to
the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's
absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a
chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer.
Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside
Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for
Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on
Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will
be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib
Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the
Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He
is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice
tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it
will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach
Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game
against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any
problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>Tacoma News Tribune</I>, Seahawks Head Coach Mike
Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as
he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I
didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he
got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would
suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster
room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure
you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost
the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy
rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game
against Miami, according to the <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</I>. He
replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with
a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a
Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at
Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the
concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss
Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point
in the season.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected
to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of
Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend
you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is
hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this
week.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a
sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken
ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback
game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided
whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the
Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't
recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain
he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring
strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the
week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish
it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled
late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11
carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to
post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster
allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this
week. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury.
However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's
game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in
this week's game. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's
game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
<i>The Tennessean</i> reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back.
The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment
options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to
play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder
showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status
for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to
week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom
Coughlin told <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. ""It remains to be seen when
Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well
this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return
date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his
groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to
play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told <i>The Baltimore
Sun</i> he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game.
Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained
ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at
running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against
Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm
feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be
something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown
a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will
replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York
Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game
against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the <I>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</I>, Canidate is expected to
start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I
wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said.
""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to
let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved
himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be
starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close
to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was
a blessing for me because I was able to get treatment every day,"" Stokes
told the <I>Contra Costa Times</I>. ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say
I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre,
however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to
be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants'
starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on
Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his
surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a
sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game
against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week
ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this
game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to
let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is
he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling
in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so
starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable.

greatly appreciated.     John

""PGS Energy Training Announces Breakthrough New Training
Product for Energy Derivatives and Electricity Trading.""

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 John Adamiak
PGS Energy Training
412-279-9298
www.seminars-on-demand.com
john@pgsenergy.com

 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - October 10, 2001 - PGS Energy Training
announced today the official release of its innovative new training product
Seminars-on-Demand (version 2.1) for the energy and electric power
industries.

Seminars-on-Demand is a completely new way to train employees in the
critical subject areas of energy derivatives, electricity trading, and
proper
deal structuring techniques. It eliminates the time and distance constraints
that frequently preclude live classroom training and enables employees to
increase their value in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.
http://www.seminars-on-demand.com/whatis.html

""In today's marketplace, a well-trained staff is a firm's most powerful
strategic weapon. This new product finally allows a company to deliver
training across the entire organization in a cost-effective and timely
manner"", said PGS Energy Training CEO John Adamiak.

Seminars-on-Demand works by combining an innovative CD-ROM
seminar presentation with a matching instructional manual and phone-based
instructor/student interaction.  Two-week, annual and unlimited corporate
enterprise licenses are available.

Free Preview CDs are available by calling 412-279-9298, visiting
www.seminars-on-demand.com, or by visiting the PGS Energy Training
booth at PowerMart in Houston next week.

Established in 1990, PGS Energy Training delivers in-depth training programs
in energy derivatives, electricity trading and gas-to-electricity arbitrage.
In addition to its new Seminars-on-Demand CD-ROM based training, PGS
Energy Training offers on-site classroom programs, open registration public
seminars and confidential training for senior executives.

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, ""it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new.""

PS  I have signed the document and have Fed Ex'ed it back to Houston.

"San Juan Proposal","Mike I think this deal makes alot of since for producers in the San Juan.  It gives you exposure to California Border pricing, firm takes, the Right of First Refusal in 2006 and the ability to sell at the wellhead.  We are flexible on the volumes, I chose 30 MM/d as an example.

Take a look at it and let me know what you think.

Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4638&key=1003&""><B>Jake Plummer</B></A>, QB ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit.

Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=4638&key=1171&""><B>Warrick Dunn</B></A>, RB TB - President Taft <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice.

"Hi!","Hi Paul,
 
Ran into ""Tim"" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our ""get together"" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
 
Take care,
Debbe.

Mark,
 
According to the listing agent, the annual gross income for this unit is $22,800.  This is actual income from the past year. Expect this year to be somewhat less.  Also, a contract has been offered on this property, but not yet accepted.  I'm going over there to take a look today.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Latest NFL Player News

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Heap practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for Sunday's game at
Cleveland. Reserve Heap on your roster this week. It would be wise to keep
him inactive until he is effective in a game. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a
football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is
dealing with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps
and bruises. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game
on Oct. 28 against Chicago. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/18/01
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's
secondary is thin because of injuries.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills
to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend
might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an
injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE
Jay Riemersma.

Drew Bledsoe, QB NE - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
There's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency
quarterback this week . Bledsoe was upgraded from ""out"" to ""doubtful"" on
the injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run,
throw or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would
just hand off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are
sidelined. Bledsoe's progress has been slower than he hoped and there's no
timetable for his return. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly miss
the next game because of an injured right knee. ""Tyrone Wheatley has a
second degree - I don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,""'
coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday. Gruden called Wheatley questionable for
the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about the
injury as the week progressed. He disputed reports that Wheatley would be
out four weeks. ""I would not agree with that at this time,"" Gruden said. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain whether he will play
in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more
serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke
had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert
said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would
start if Weinke cannot play.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's confident
he'll play Sunday against San Diego. Griese complained of shoulder soreness
after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was
aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks
defensive end Lamar King. Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his
shoulder. 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained
ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is
in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green
would replace Smoot if he's unable to go. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas
City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised
if his status is downgraded over the next two days. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to
play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to
start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/17/01
Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's
game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he
may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week,
Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head
Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday
against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good
choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/17/01
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on
Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues
from a Fantasy perspective. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in
the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable
to use Fantasy-wise. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was
filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his
swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in
Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become
Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but
his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a
right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis
Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/17/01
Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a
right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week,
this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes
completely clear he will start.

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB
job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup
Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head
Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend
you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to
recommend you start any Broncos running back.

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/17/01
Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too
productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars'
previous. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked
like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well
this week and catch a lot of passes. 

Sean Dawkins, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of
couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/17/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in
Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is
listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only
has five catches this season. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several
passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Herman Moore, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his
hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is
much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We
believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the
muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team. Larry Foster assumes
the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with
a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to
Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> points out Garner has apparently supplanted
Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent
before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee
injury.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Henry told the <i>Buffalo News</i> he plans to have minor surgery on both
knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not
affect him during the regular season.

Jay Riemersma, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says the Bills want to get Riemersma more involved
in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are healthy
again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the year, but
he will now become more involved in the passing game.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this week against the
Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reggie Wayne would
start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Miami Herald</i> says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he
had a problem with stress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will
return.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
According to the <I>Dallas Morning Star</I>, Smith could end up splitting
more carries with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo
believes the two backs complement each other very well, and that the move
will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Alexander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which
revealed a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action
due to the injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/17/01
Pittman, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is
expected to practice on Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against
Kansas City is questionable, but he is expected to play. 

Greg Clark, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Clark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on
his right hamstring three weeks ago. ""It was encouraging,"" Clark told the
<I>Contra Costa Times</I>. ""I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of
that before the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The
most I could do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in
comparison."" Head Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be
healthy enough to make his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out
for their Oct. 28 game against Chicago. 

 Giants, DT NYG - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
Defensive tackle Keith Hamilton suffered a separated shoulder during
Sunday's game against St. Louis, but he is expected to play on Monday night
against Philadelphia. Linebacker Mike Barrow has a hip pointer, but should
be able to play in the game as well with some extra padding. CB Will Allen
has a sprained ankle, and his status against the Eagles is questionable at
this point. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
According to the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>, Leaf will get his chance to
win the starting QB job in the next few weeks. ""If we're going to get an
evaluation on him, this is the open window,"" coach Dave Campo said. ""At
this point, I don't know if he's going to be any more than the third
quarterback, but this is the window of opportunity."" In any event, Leaf's
value as a Fantasy player will be very minimal. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/17/01
Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order
to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his
status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Swinton (hamstring) will not practice this week in order to rest his
injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for
the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Robert Thomas, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Thomas had an MRI performed on his sprained left ankle Monday, and is now
expected to miss the remainder of the season. Thomas has no real Fantasy
value at this point. 

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Hasselbeck is scheduled to start the Seahawks' next game October 28 against
Miami due to a groin injury suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. ""Matt has
had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever
he has to prove,"" Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the <I>Seattle
Post-Intelligencer</I>. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter
right now, especially against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he
is not expected to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to
the <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</I>. ""There's more to it than just a
normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that,"" Seahawks Head Coach Mike
Holmgren said Monday. ""He's injured, and he won't practice this week.""
Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect
him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson
could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the <I>Kansas City Star</I>.
Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/16/01
Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he
sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were
expected back Tuesday.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during
Sunday's game against the Jets, according to the <I>Miami Herald</I>. He
should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/16/01
The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in
San Diego, according to the <I>Denver Post</I>. However, An MRI Monday
morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to
his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's
practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to
get the start.

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville
despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all
year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't
use Johnson.

Jamal Anderson, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left
knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured reserve and is
out for the remainder of the 2001 season. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/16/01
Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets
despite a bruised right knee. ""He really could possibly play this week,""
coach Mike Martz said. ""We're not going to rule the possibility of him
playing completely out."" If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate
will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a
decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the
situation throughout the week. 

Justin McCareins, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle
Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle
Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the
rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards. 

Eddie Berlin, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams, will be sidelined
three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a
kickoff return Sunday.

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Browns' head coach Butch Davis told <i>The Akron Plain-Dealer</i> that
Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens.
Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if
you need an extra wideout this week. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is
recovering from a bruised left shoulder.

Marco Battaglia, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is
suffering from a strained left shoulder. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the
most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will
play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson
in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay
Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw
interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the
fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared himself fit enough to play. ""I'm
still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see
if I was alive,"" he said, ""but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready."" 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during
Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the
injury and is currently listed as day-to-day. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to
Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as
day-to-day. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback
on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to
split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him
Fantasy-wsie. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/16/01
Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis.
The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be
in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be
available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a
decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we
expect him to go. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over
Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble
time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday
night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as
day-to-day. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He
didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy
player at this point. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his
hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday. He is expected to miss six weeks
of action due to the procedure. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He
finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact
Fantasy-wise. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring
any setbacks, Barber will be available for Monday's game against
Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a
drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was
dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo
tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be
determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would
step into the No. 1 RB role once again. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from
playing at full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever
bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad
idea if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Doug Chapman, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/16/01
Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay
due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for
the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good
numbers against a solid Packers' defense. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
According to the <I>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</I>, Bennett (ankle) is
expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a
protective boot on Monday and was walking with a noticeable limp. Doug
Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's absence. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/16/01
Muhammad suffered a hip injury during Sunday's loss to the New Orleans
Saints. However, the injury won't keep him from playing in this weekend's
game against Washington. Considering the Redskins' woes, it's a good idea
to start Muhammad Fantasy-wise. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Weinke is dealing with a slight thigh injury, but he is expected to play on
Sunday against Washington. With the state of the Redskins team, Weinke may
be worth starting Fantasy-wise. 

Herman Moore, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/15/01
Moore suffered a hip pointed during the second quarter of Sunday's game. It
was his only play of the game, which demonstrates how little his Fantasy
value is these days. He is listed as day-to-day. 

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
The Bears plan to re-sign Matthews possibly on Monday, according to the
<I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>. He would return to his backup QB job, and isn't
worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/15/01
Mike Holmgren has confirmed Trent Dilfer will return to the bench when
Seattle plays its next game. Hasselbeck is expected to start against Miami
on Oct. 28. ""The plan is still to prepare for Miami with Matt as the guy,""
Holmgren said. Neither player has been a very useful Fantasy starter so
far, but Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment, while Dilfer has played
mistake-free football.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/15/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches. He is expected to play in
Week Six.

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/15/01
Smith sprained his right ankle on Sunday against the Jets. The injury is
not considered to be serious, and Smith was able to finish the game.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/15/01
Griese re-aggravated a shoulder injury on Sunday at Seattle. The <i>Denver
Post</i> says Griese's shoulder will be re-examined on Monday or Tuesday.
""I was able to come back and play this week, and I'm hoping to do the same
next week,"" Griese said.

Chad Johnson, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Johnson is expected to miss six weeks with a fractured collarbone. He
injured the shoulder in the third quarter of Sunday's game.Ron Dugans might
now become Cincinanti's third receiver. 

Terry Jackson, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Jackson suffered a calf injury Sunday. He is listed as probable for next
week's game at Chicago. 

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says Johnson (neck) looked good in practice on
Sunday. He is expected to play in Week Six. """"He threw the ball extremely
well, especially in the wind today,"" said coach Gregg Williams. ""He had a
fresh arm. It seems like there is no residual effect from it right now."" 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/15/01
A hip injury prevented Muhammad from finishing Sunday's game. He is
expected to play in next week's game against the Redskins. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/15/01
Mathis shook off a hip injury and played in Sunday's game. However, a
sprained hand limited him to four catches for 50 yards. The hand injury
isn't considered to be serious. Mathis will be evaluated on a day-to-day
basis. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Christian suffered bruised ribs in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a
day to day basis. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01
Jefferson missed a lot of playing time Sunday because of a sprained left
big toe. He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/15/01
The St. Louis Rams will be without Faulk for at least one week. The Rams
originally diagnosed the injury as a sprained right medial collateral
ligament, but an MRI revealed no severe ligament or cartilage damage. Rams
coach Mike Martz fears that Faulk may be sidelined for at least three
weeks. ""They (the doctors) think he will be out somewhere between three to
four weeks,"" Martz said. Faulk will be re-evaluated next week and believes
it is possible he could return for a key NFC West game against the New
Orleans Saints on October 28. ""We'll see,"" Faulk said. ""It's kind of early
to say, but you never know."" 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/15/01
Weinke continued to struggle Sunday, fumbling away the center exchange on
Carolina's second possession, losing another fumble when his arm was hit as
he attempted to pass and also throwing an interception. All three turnovers
led to Saints scores, putting Carolina down 17-0. He finished 21-of-39 for
196 yards and two second-half touchdowns. Use him as a reserve for now. 

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/14/01
Dilfer left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was
replaced by Matt Hasselbeck.

Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/14/01
Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect
Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid
outing. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical
silence,

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33
carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a
Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues
to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even
when Ricky Watters returns.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/14/01
Fiedler threw for 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was
also picked off twice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and
is no better than a reserve at this point. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/14/01
Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and
a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but
he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/14/01
Coles was very prodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches
for 77 yards and two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting
every week just yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a
roster spot. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/14/01
Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two
touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very
useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right. 

Glyn Milburn, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01
Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will
be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/14/01
Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against
Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider
dropping Bennett altogether.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Luccis Losers Player News

Charlie Garner, Reserve RB Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> points out Garner has apparently supplanted
Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent
before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee
injury.

Duce Staley, Active RB Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback
on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to
split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him
Fantasy-wsie. 

Steve McNair, Injured QB Updated 10/14/01
McNair finally had a productive game Fantasy-wise, compiling 284 yards of
total offense and two touchdowns against Tampa Bay. He's still not a
reliable weekly option Fantasy-wise, so use him only if the matchup is
right. 

Cameron Cleeland, Active TE Updated 10/14/01
Cleeland overcame a hamstring problem to play against Carolina, and he
caught two TD passes. The injury-prone tight end finished with three
catches for 38 yards, but he remains a Fantasy risk because he simply can't
seem to stay healthy for very long.

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01
Hayes caught seven passes for 44 yards against the Saints. If opponents
continue to pay extra attention to Muhsin Muhammad, Hayes might continue to
post some respectable numbers.

Kurt Warner, Active QB Updated 10/14/01
Warner left Sunday's game against the N.Y. Giants in the fourth quarter
after having the wind knocked out of him. However, he returned to action
after being sidelined for only one play. 

Ike Hilliard, Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01
Hilliard, who was dealing with a slight oblique strain, played on Sunday
against St. Louis. He caught three passes for 49 yards and a score in New
York's 15-14 loss. 

Mike Alstott, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Alstott will once again be the Bucs' featured back in Warrick Dunn's
absence. He may not post good yardage numbers against Tennessee, but
Alstott does have a good shot at putting up a touchdown against the Titans. 

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 10/12/01
Carter has struggled, but he's too good not to start on a weekly basis.
Look for him to find the end zone against Detroit on Sunday. 

James McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 10/12/01
McKnight will definitely be a TD threat this week. He should be able to get
loose for some long gains.

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 10/12/01
Booker has been one of the season's early sleepers Fantasy-wise. He'll have
a great chance at posting bug numbers against a shaky Arizona secondary, so
give him the starting nod this week. 

Ravens, Active DT Updated 10/07/01
Linebacker Ray Lewis (elbow) was in the starting lineup for Baltimore in
Sunday's game against Tennessee. Baltimore's defense looks spectacular
early on, and could put up some big Fantasy points against the Titans. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, Active WR Updated 09/08/01
Hakim might see a few passes thrown his way during the Rams' season opener
Sunday in Philadelphia. However, his offensive potential is limited as a
No. 3 receiving threat, so his Fantasy ceiling isn't very high.

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Fantasy Football Matchups 

Every Friday our Fantasy experts break down the key Fantasy matchup of the week. It may be a top running back facing a sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a premier cover-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense with ball-hawking safeties. We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups in every NFL game to help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check our Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar) Fridays for Fantasy Football Matchups.

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA 

Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins? 

Answer - GG 

As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied. 


Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL 

I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend? 

Answer - GG 

Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game. 


Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE 

Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks? Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available. 

Answer - GG 

Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.

Latest NFL Player News

Drew Bledsoe, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/27/01
Bledsoe will dress for Sunday's game against the Broncos but he won't play.
He is expected to be listed as the No. 3 QB but is still another 2-3 weeks
away from returning. 

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/27/01
James could miss the Indianapolis Colts game next week at Buffalo because
of a sprained left knee. James injured the knee with about 4:30 left in
Thursday's 35-28 victory at Kansas City. Colts coach Jim Mora said James
had an MRI exam Friday confirmed he had a sprained knee -- but no
structural damage. Mora listed James as questionable, meaning there's a
50-50 chance he would play Nov. 4 against the Bills. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Horn will have another disappointing game this week. Rams CB Aeneas
Williams will probably draw him in coverage and nuetralize him for long
periods.

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
Brooks won't post huge yardage totals against the Rams. The St. Louis
secondary will use its good speed to take away the deep pass.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Davis won't be a major factor against the Giants. New York will look to
stuff the run early on, and will force Tony Banks to the air, as the
Giants' defense dictates the flow of the game.

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Holt should have a good second half against the Saints. He should
eventually wear CB Fred Thomas out, and Holt will be a key receiver late in
the game.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Canidate will start in place of the injured Marshall Faulk again this week.
His numbers won't be overwhelming against the solid Saints defense.

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Warner is always a good start, but he may feel some extra pressure this
week. New Orleans' front seven will try to disrupt his timing as often as
possible.

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Ismail has developed into a good all-around receiver. He is definitely
worth a start against the inconsistent Jaguars secondary.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Taylor has been inconsistent this year, yet he has a good matchup this
week. Jacksonville's pass defense is erratic and may let Taylor get in the
end zone for a score.

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Walls will get a lot of important looks this week. The Panthers should move
the ball rather well against the Jets, and Walls may be open for TD catches
near the goal line.

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Hayes will definitely be a TD threat this week. The Jets' defense gives up
a lot of yardage, and Hayes will certainly get chances to score in the red
zone.

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Muhammad should have a good game againt the Jets. New York's defense is
definitely vulnerable to big-play wideouts.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Smith should be good for at least one TD this week. The Patriots should
move the ball well against Denver.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
Brady may have another good game this week. Denver's pass defense is very
vulnerable, and Brady is looking good at the helm of the New England
offense.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Gannon will have trouble moving the ball against a tough Eagles defense but
should still find a way to score a touchdown. Look for him to either throw
a TD pass or get a rushing score. 

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Rice will catch some passes this week but don't expect him to score a
touchdown. The Eagles have one of the top pass defenses in the NFL and have
only allowed five TD passes all season. 

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
Brown faces a formidable Eagles secondary but should have a good game. He
has done well against NFC opponents recently. Brown has 20 receptions and
three touchdowns in his last four games against the NFC. 

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Howard will have a major role in the passing attack now that receivers
Herman Moore and Germane Crowell are out for the season. Howard might not
catch a lot of passes this week but should score a touchdown. He has
exceptional breakaway speed. We still wouldn't advise starting him yet.
Howard must first prove that he can be a reliable wideout.

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Stewart is expected to play on Sunday. His ankle injury was originally
diagnosed as a sprain, but is now being classified as a bruise. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Morton should have a solid game against the Bengals this week. The
Cincinnati secondary has been adequate at best this season and has given up
eight touchdown passes.

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
Martin had scored a touchdown in each of his first five games until the
Jets shut him out Sunday. Look for Martin to rebound and have a good game
this week against the Panthers. Carolina has one of the worst run defenses
in the NFL. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Coles will be the primary receiver this week, replacing the injured Wayne
Chrebet. Coles has played well in recent weeks. Expect him to catch a lot
of passes and score a touchdown. 

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Robinson won't challenge the Miami secondary this week. The rookie receiver
has been a Fantasy disappointment so far.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Brunell has been an adequate starter but will have a tough matchup against
the Ravens. Baltimore has struggled against the pass in recent weeks but we
wouldn't advise using Brunell. He doesn't have enough talent at receiver to
post good numbers against Baltimore. 

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
Jackson won't do much against the Dolphins. CB Sam Madison will keep him
quiet throughout Sunday's game.

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Alexander may have his first disappointing outing of the year. Miami's
defense will be geared to stopping the run, and will strive to contain
Alexander and force Matt Hasselbeck to throw often.

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
McCardell struggled in the first few games as he made his way back from
injury, but has begun to look like his old self in the previous game.
Expect McCardell to be a solid No. 2 receiver this week. 

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Stewart may throw a TD pass against the vulnerable Tennessee secondary, but
he may also see a lot of blitzes. Turnovers and rushed passes may hurt his
overall numbers.

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Brady has been a disappointment so far this season. He didn't have high
expectations coming into the season, but many expected him to have more
than the eight receptions and a touchdown this season. Don't expect him to
be productive this week. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Mason has been a disappointment so far because of injuries. He might get
deep once or twice against Pittsburgh, but his overall numbers won't be
impressive.

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Look for Smith to be a solid No. 2 receiver this week. He has struggled to
score in recent games. Smith has caught a lot of passes this season but
hasn't had a touchdown since Week One. 

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Chamberlain won't have a very productive day against the Buccaneers. He
won't see a lot of receiving room over the middle.

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Carter should be good for at least one TD catch against Tampa Bay. He will
give CB Donnie Abraham a lot of trouble.

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Culpepper might have to carry the offense against Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers
will crack down on the run early, and Culpepper will have to scramble or
throw into tight coverages. He may turn the ball over more than once.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Barber will likely be used mostly on third downs. He has taken a lesser
role in the running game this season and is not worth starting right now. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Expect Dayne to have a big game this week against the Redskins. Washington
has one of the worst run defenses in football. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Collins has been inconsistent this season but should throw at least one
touchdown pass this week against the Redskins. Washington has one of the
worst defenses in the NFL. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Staley is recovering from a shoulder injury but is expected to play in
Sunday's game against the Raiders, despite being listed as probable. Don't
expect him to gain a lot of yards. The Raiders have one of the best run
defenses.

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Expect McNabb to have another good game this week. The Raiders have had
trouble containing mobile quarterbacks in the past few years. McNabb should
score with either a touchdown run or pass. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Lewis should catch an adequate amount of passes this week. The Raiders will
have good coverage on the Philadelphia receivers but Lewis will manage to
slip through the coverage. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Thrash to be too productive this week. He has been
inconsistent this season and faces one of the top secondaries. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He
managed to practice Thursday after sitting out Wednesday's practice. Look
for Pinkston to be an adequate second Fantasy receiver this week. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Smith has a leg injury but is expected to play this week. He is listed as
probable on the injury report. Expect Smith to overcome his injury and be a
solid Fantasy back this week. 

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Fiedler has thrown a decent amount of TD passes this season, but he has
also thrown a lot of interceptions. Look for him to throw a TD pass and at
least one interception this week. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
McKnight has been inconsistent this season but should catch some passes
against the Seahawks. Expect him to be an adequate No. 2 receiver for your
squad. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Gadsden should catch a few passes this week. The Seahawks have had trouble
stopping the pass this season. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Smith should have some success against the Cardinals this week. Arizona has
allowed an average of 138.6 yards per game. Expect Smith to gain at least
85 yards and score a touchdown. 

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Tomlinson should have a big game this week against an inadequate Buffalo
run defense. Tomlinson has been an effective runner so far while the Bills
have allowed an average of 138.6 yards per game. 

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Fluite will be productive but don't expect him to throw a lot of touchdown
passes Sunday against the Bills. San Diego will have so much success
running the ball that they won't need Flutie to throw. 

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Conway to be too productive this week. He has been mediocre as
the Chargers' primary receiver scoring two touchdowns and catching 20
passes in six games. He will be a good No. 2 receiver at best. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Graham should catch some passes against the Bills this week but don't
expect him to score a touchdown. He's still not reliable enough to start on
a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Pittman had 95 yards rushing last week against the Chiefs. The Cowboys'
defense is a bit tougher than the Chiefs, but Pittman should still be
productive. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 back this week. 

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Plummer has been an adequate passer all season. He should continue that
trend this week against the Cowboys, who have a mediocre pass rush. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Sanders has struggled this season but should play better against Dallas
this week. The Arizona offensive line will give QB Jake Plummer good
protection and allow Sanders a lot of time to get open. Expect him to catch
some passes and score a touchdown. 

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Look for Boston to play well against the Cowboys Sunday. Dallas has an
inexperinced secondary while Boston is emerging as a premier receiver. 

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Expect Johnson to be accurate this week but he will probably have a hard
time throwing TD passes. Johnson has played better in recent weeks but his
top two receivers are suffering from injuries. 

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Anderson has struggled lately but should rebound against the Patriots this
week. Expect him to gain at least 80 yards this week and run for a
touchdown. The Patriots have given up five rushing TDs this season. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Griese is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Patriots because
of a lingering shoulder injury. Look for him to play through the injury and
throw at least one touchdown pass. Griese won't dominate but he will be a
solid starting QB this week. 

Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Kennison to do well this week. He only has 13 catches and a
touchdown in five starts this season.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Dillon was limited to just 30 yards rushing by the Bears last week but
should be more productive this week. He is facing a Lions defense that has
allowed an average of 131.8 yards in five games. Look for Dillon to gain a
good amount of yards and score a touchdown. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Kitna failed to throw a TD pass last week but expect him to toss a few
against the Lions this week. Detroit has given up 10 TD passes in five
games this season. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/26/01
Warrick should catch a lot of passes this week but don't expect him to
score a touchdown. He has just one TD reception in six games.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Scott has struggled this season, but look for him to catch some passes this
week against a struggling Lions secondary. He should be an adequate No. 3
wideout this week in leagues that start three receivers. 

David Terrell, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Terrell had a breakthrough performance last week catching a season-high
seven passes for 91 yards. Look for him to continue to catch passes this
week against the 49ers and possibly score his first touchdown. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
Miller's pass protection will give him an adequate amount of time to throw
the ball this week against the mediocre San Francisco pass rush. Look for
Miller to unleash passes all over the field and accumulate Fantasy points. 

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/26/01
Booker should once again be a good starting receiver this week. He is the
Bears' top receiving option now that Marcus Robinson is out for the season
and faces a 49ers defense that has allowed six TD receptions in five games. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Garcia will find it difficult to move the ball against the Bears' defense
but he should still find a way to be productive. Look for him to score a
touchdown either by running it in or throwing the ball.

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Hearst has been effective this season, but not very explosive. Look for him
to struggle against the stingy Bears defense this week. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Owens set the record for most receptions in a game the last time he played
the Bears. He won't be as effective this week, but will be a productive
receiver. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
Stokes has been nursing sore legs and might not be at full strength for
Sunday's game. He has struggled when healthy so don't expect him to score a
lot of points this week.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Henry should be able to gain between 70-90 yards against the Chargers but
he will have a tough time scoring a touchdown. San Diego has only allowed
two rushing TDs this season. 

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Johnson has not thrown a lot of TD passes this season, totaling just three
in five games. It will be difficult for him to throw the ball effectively
against the Chargers so don't rely on him for a lot of Fantasy points.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Look for Centers to have a big game this season. He is the Bills leading
receiver this season with 35 receptions. Expect him to catch a lot of
passes this week and be a solid No. 2 back. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Price to be too productive this week. He only has nine catches
this season.

Jay Riemersma, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Riemersma should catch a few passes this week but don't expect him to score
a TD. He lacks the speed to break away for a long reception and hasn't been
getting too many looks inside the red zone. 

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 10/26/01
Moulds suffered a minor leg injury in practice Thursday but is expected to
play Sunday. Look for Moulds to catch several passes and score a touchdown.
He has caught a TD pass in each of the last two games. 

Terry Kirby, RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Kirby might be activated for the first time this season, according to
<i>The Contra Costa Times</i>. The Raiders plan to use him if Tyrone
Wheatley is unable to play. But don't expect Kirby to get a lot of touches.
Oakland will likely rely on Charlie Garner instead. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/26/01
Wheatley missed practice again on Thursday because of wrist and knee
injuries. He remains questionable for Sunday's game. Terry Kirby will
replace him in the rotation if he is unable to play. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Jones, recovering from a shoulder injury, returned to practice Thursday. He
might remains questionable for this week's game but might see some action. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Sharpe has been downgraded on the injury report from probable to
questionable. He has been limited in practice all week because of a leg
injury. Rookie Todd Heap might get a lot of looks on offense but he is also
recovering from injury. The Ravens may be forced to use tight end John
Jones. 

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Wilkins missed Thursday's game at Kansas City. He was held out of the
lineup because of broken ribs. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/26/01
Pathon missed his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a
sprained right foot. He was replaced by rookie Reggie Wayne in the starting
lineup. 

Drew Bledsoe, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
It doesn't appear that Bledsoe will be used as an emergency QB Sunday, but
<i>The Boston Herald</i> reports that doctors will make a decision on
whether on not to increase his workload. Bledsoe has thrown 75 passes in
the past two days without experiencing any adverse affects. 

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Joseph might replace Stacey Mack as the starting back this Sunday,
according to <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. Mack has made two critical
mistakes in the past two games. Joseph has been getting a lot of carries
this week and has already been slated to be the third-down back. We
wouldn't advise using either player this week if you already have two solid
backs. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Mack might be replaced in the starting lineup by rookie Elvis Joseph,
according to <i>The Florida Times-Union</i>. The Jaguars are reportedly
looking to use Joseph because of the mistakes Mack has made in the past two
games. Consider reserving Mack this week. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Galloway was limited in practice once again Thursday because of a foot
injury. <i>The Dallas Morning News</i> reports that he will be a gametime
decision. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Swinton practiced Thursday an is expected to play Sunday, according to
<i>The Dallas Morning News</i>. Swinton had been limited for most of the
week because of a hamstring injury. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Don't expect Bennett to return to the starting lineup soon. He is listed as
questionable on the injury report but probably won't return until after the
Vikings' bye in Week Eight. 

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/26/01
Green was limited in practice Thursday because of a groin injury. He
remains questionable for Sunday's game and will be re-evaluated on
Saturday. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
Dunn was limited in practice Thursday because of his hamstring injury and
remains questionable for Sunday's game. He will be re-evaluated on
Saturday. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/26/01
Johnson was upgraded from questionable to probable Thursday. He is
suffering from hip and thigh injuries but was able to run for the second
consecutive day. Johnson is expected to play in Sunday's game. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/26/01
Ward (ankle) was limited in practice Thursday, according to <i>The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>. He is still expected to play in Monday's game
against Tennessee. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/26/01
The Patriots will reportedly bench Glenn once again this week if he doesn't
show any improvement in practice Friday. Glenn is suffering from a
hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game. 

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Smith is listed as probable on the injury report. He is suffering from an
ankle injury but is expected to start Sunday's game against New England. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Weinke is suffering from a hip injury but is expected to start Sunday's
game. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Matthews is suffering from sore ribs but is expected to be the No. 2 QB
Sunday. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01
Allen practiced Wednesday but was too sore to work out Thursday. He remains
questionable for Sunday's game but <i>The Washington Post</i> claims that
it is almost certain Allen will be replaced by Jason Brookins. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/26/01
Not only is Wright out for the season, he might need season-ending surgery
to repair his damaged knee. An MRI showed that he damaged the same ACL that
was repaired in five years ago. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/26/01
Head coach Mike Martz has ruled Faulk out for Sunday's game, according to
<i>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>. Faulk is still recovering from a
bruised knee so Trung Canidate will replace him as the starting running
back once again.

The total cost of the project is $26,896,800  with a proposed rolled-in treatment for the expansion out of the Raton Basin Area.

Latest NFL Player News

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Don't expect Stewart to help your Fantasy team this week. The Steelers had
success running the ball last week, using a two-pronged attack, and will
stick to that strategy. Besides, Stewart won't be too effective when he
finally does throw the ball. He hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in three
games this season. 

Troy Edwards, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Edwards will catch a few passes this week but he won't be productive enough
to help a Fantasy team. The Steelers will run the ball for most of the
game. 

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Amos might become famous soon enough if he continues to run like he did
last week. Look for him to continue to run well this week against the
Chiefs and score a touchdown. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Burress' struggles will continue again this week, but it won't be solely
because of his effort. The Steelers will implement a strict running game.
They were extremely successful running the ball last week. Also, Burress
won't get open enough to be productive.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Dunn tested his sprained right foot in practice Friday and could return to
Tampa Bay's lineup against the Tennessee Titans. His status for this week
was upgraded from questionable to probable Friday, though a decision on
whether he will play won't be made until Sunday. If he is cleared to play,
Dunn expects to assume his normal workload. But he is a risky Fantasy start
because of his uncertain condition. Dunn won't put up good numbers if he is
less than 100 percent. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Griese is now listed as questionable for Week Five with a sore shoulder,
but he is expected to play against the Seahawks. He was able to practice
without any apparent problems on Friday.

Bobby Engram, WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Engram has developed a good on-field relationship with Trent Dilfer. He
might post solid numbers for the second consecutive week.

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Jackson has started to fade away as a Fantasy receiver. If Bobby Engram
continues to play well. Jackson will get less looks from the Seattle QBs.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Dilfer will start for the second consecutive week. Expect him to throw at
least one TD pass against Denver, but the Seahawks will lean heavily on the
run against the Broncos.

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Alexander is definitely a good start this week. He should score at least
one TD against the questionable Denver defense.

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Robinson should get more opportunities to catch the ball when Trent Dilfer
is playing. But he has yet to prove he can put up quality Fantasy numbers.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Garner might be a major offensive factor this week. The Colts are soft
against the run, and Tyrone Wheatley is questionable with a wrist injury.
Garner might be asked to carry the ball often against the weak Indianapolis
run defense.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Wheatley is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against with a wrist
injury. Charlie Garner will get the majority of the carries if Wheatley is
not ready to play against the Colts.

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/12/01
Rice should have another good outing. He should draw inexperienced
Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which means Rice will definitely
be a TD threat again this week.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/12/01
Gannon should have a fine game against the Colts. Indianapolis will have a
lot of trouble handling wideouts Tim Brown and Jerry Rice.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Jones has been a disappointment so far this year. Don't count on good
numbers from him this week, because the Chargers will feature the run
against New England.

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Graham might be a good start against New England. He should be able to get
open often against CB Otis Smith.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Conway is a risky start this week. The Chargers will feature their ground
game against New England, and CB Ty Law won't let Conway stray too far from
his view.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
The Patriots seem like a soft opponent, but don't expect Flutie to post
super totals. The Chargers will depend on the run to spur them to victory.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Consider Clark as a starter this week. The Seahawks are soft over the
middle and in the red zone, where Clark can be effective.

Dwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Carswell is a good start this week. Seattle's defense has always been
vulnerable to tight ends over the middle.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Smith's yardage numbers might be a bit disappointing this week if Seattle
CB Shawn Springs (hamstring, probable) is close to top form. But he should
still catch at least one TD pass as the Seahawks hurt their secondary with
the lack of a solid pass rush.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Expect excellent numbers from Anderson this week. He always plays well
against Seattle, and the Seahawks still lack the talent to stop him from
gaining big chunks of yardage as the game wears on.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Griese should be good for at least two TD passes against the Seahawks. He
should have a lot of time to throw against the weak Seattle pass rush.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Minnis might be asked to be Kansas City's No. 1 receiver this week, because
Derrick Alexander is expected to sit out with a back injury. That is a
major task for a rookie receiver. Facing the physical Pittsburgh defense
will limit Minnis' output, and he is a risky start.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Gonzalez might a major factor in Kansas City's passing game this week.
Trent Green will struggle to find open wideouts, and will look to Gonzalez
to help him move the ball on important downs.

Jermaine Wiggins, TE NE - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Wiggins has done very little to improve his Fantasy value this season. He's
not worth a roster spot at this point, so release him if you took a chance
on him early in the season. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Don't expect great numbers from Holmes this week. Pittsburgh has been tough
against the run, and has the speed at LB to contain him on the outside.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Alexander practiced on Thursday, but he is still being bothered by back
problems. If he is able to play against Pittsburgh, he will be very
limited.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Patten now moves in the starting lineup as New England's No. 2 wideout due
to the release of Bert Emanuel. It will be a short-lived stint, however,
because Terry Glenn is expected to return to the team soon. As a result,
Patten isn't worth much more than a reserve spot Fantasy-wise. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Green might have another bad week. Pittsburgh's defense will pressure him
often, and the Chiefs will be less effective in the air without the injured
Derrick Alexander.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Brady's numbers have been anything but impressive in Drew Bledsoe's
absence. He isn't really worthy of Fantasy consideration, so don't pick him
up for your roster. 

Ken Dilger, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Dilger might be a minor factor in the passing game against Oakland. He
should get more looks this week, because the Colts have been hit hard by
injuries at wide receiver.

Phil Dawson, K CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Look for Dawson to connect on a few field goals this week. The Browns will
have trouble capitalizing inside the red zone but Dawson will help them
score with accurate kicking. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Look for Kitna to complete a fair amount of passes this week and score at
least one touchdown. The Browns defense will be tough, but Kitna will find
a way to get at least one score. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Head Coach Bill Belichick has given Glenn a 50-50 chance of playing on
Sunday against San Diego. However, the veteran wideout is not worth
starting from a Fantasy perspective this week. 

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Pollard should find himself in a position to score this week. Indianapolis
should move the ball consistently in the air against Oakland.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Redmond is questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego due to an ankle
injury. He probably will miss this game due to the injury, which makes him
virtually worthless Fantasy-wise. 

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Harrison should be able to get past the 100-yard receiving mark against the
Raiders. Oakland's secondary sometimes gives up big plays to the league's
better speed receivers.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Look for Dillon to have mixed success this week. The Browns defense will
make it difficult to run but his effort as a receiver will be enough to
give him a productive week. 

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
James' rushing yardage numbers might not be stellar against Oakland. But
the Colts will put him in position to score more than once.

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Manning should throw at least two TD passes against Oakland. The Raiders'
secondary runs hot and cold, and sometimes has trouble with marquee
quarterbacks.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/12/01
Warrick is suffering from a leg injury but is expected to play this week.
He won't be too productive. Warrick only has 18 catches in four games and
has scored just once. 

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Scott won't be too productive this week. He only averages four catches a
game and hasn't scored a touchdown. Rookie Chad Johnson might cut into his
playing time. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Carter needs surgery to repair his torn hamstring and will be lost for up
to eight weeks. Anthony Wright will start in Carter's place, but neither QB
has much Fantasy value at this point. 

Mike Vanderjagt, K IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Vanderjagt (toe) kicked in practice on Thursday. He is expected to play
against the Raiders.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
As has been the popular theme in Baltimore, Grbac will throw the ball a lot
this week. He won't be too accurate but will connect for at least one
touchdown pass. 

Brandon Stokley, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Stokley won't be productive this week. He has had problems getting open.
That is part of the reason why he lost his starting job. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Sharpe will be very effective in a hard-fought game against the Packers
this week. He will catch a lot of passes and most likely score on a short
pass. 

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Martin should register at least one TD against the Dolphins. The Jets are
not intimidated by Miami's defense, and will put their star RB in position
to score inside the red zone.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Taylor will have another solid game this week. Expect him to catch several
passes and use his height to snag a touchdown pass or two. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Testaverde is a risky start this week. While he might throw more than one
TD pass, he also might turn the ball over more than once against Miami.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Don't expect Allen to get a lot of yards this week. However, he might score
a touchdown. The Ravens have been getting him a lot of carries once they
get close to the goal line. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Ismail will catch several passes this week but don't expect him to score.
The Ravens will spread the ball around a lot in their passing attack and
will look to Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor once they get inside the red
zone. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
McKnight will definitely be a TD threat this week. He should be able to get
loose for some long gains.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Gadsden should find himself in position to catch a TD pass against the
Jets. Miami will score often against the New York defense.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Look for Wycheck to catch a lot of passes this week. He hasn't had a lot of
looks because he has been used mostly as a fullback, blocking for Eddie
George. But George is suffering from an ankle injury and isn't expected to
get a lot of carries. The Titans will throw to Wycheck to compensate. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Smith should have a super day against the Jets. New York hasn't stopped
anyone on the ground, and Smith has run over everyone he has faced so far.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
The Titans normally implement a strict running game in their offense. But
with RB Eddie George suffering from an ankle injury they will throw the
ball a lot on Sunday. McNair will be able to move the chains using short
passes but he won't beat anyone deep. He has had troubles throwing the deep
ball and will face a lot of pressure from the Tampa pass rush. He will
connect on short passes, but is more apt to run for a touchdown. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Bennett was held in check once again last Sunday, posting only 36 yards of
total offense against New Orleans. He may be worth starting in deeper
leagues against Detroit, however, but we'd avoid him if at all possible. 

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Fiedler should have a good week against the Jets. New York's pass defense
will surrender at least two TDs if it cannot effectively pressure the Miami
QB.

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Dyson will get a lot of passes thrown his way this week. Although fellow
wideout Derrick Mason is suffering from injuries starting RB Eddie George
is also injured. Look for Tennessee to through the ball a lot. Dyson will
catch a fair amount of these passes but don't expect him to score. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Culpepper could have his best game of the season on Sunday against Detroit.
He's far too valuable to ever place on reserve, so start him with
confidence this week. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Sanders will start Sunday's game if injured receiver Derrick Mason is
unable to play, but don't expect him to be too productive. He lacks the
separation speed to distance himself from the secondary and QB Steve McNair
has had trouble throwing the ball downfield this season.

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Carter has struggled, but he's too good not to start on a weekly basis.
Look for him to find the end zone against Detroit on Sunday. 

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Chamberlain has quickly become one of the key weapons in the Vikings'
passing game, and he is a reliable weekly Fantasy starter. Expect another
good outing this weekend against Detroit. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/12/01
Moss has underachieved thus far, but he'll put up a huge game against
Detroit. The Lions can't seem to stop anyone on defense, so Moss should
have a big day. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
George remains questionable for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay because of
a sprained ankle and will likely be a gametime decision. He missed practice
once again on Thursday. Head coach Jeff Fisher said earlier this week that
George would be a gametime decision if he didn't practice on Thursday or
Friday. He is expected to get a lesser amount of carries even if he does
play. Skip Hicks and Mike Green will get more attempts to lessen George's
load. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Williams put up a huge performance against Minnesota last Sunday despite a
shoulder injury. He's a must-start against Carolina, especially after his
solid performance last week. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Horn is a must-start this weekend against Carolina. The Panthers' secondary
is very vulnerable, and Horn has put up good numbers against them in the
past. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Mason missed practice once again on Thursday because of ankle and shoulder
injuries. He remains questionable for Sunday's game. Kevin Dyson and Chris
Sanders will be the starting receivers if Mason is inactive. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Coles (knee) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Jets.
Matthew Hatchette would likely start if Coles cannot play.

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Cleeland is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Carolina with
a hamstring injury. He is expected to play, however, but Fantasy owners may
want to consider benching him. He hasn't done much from a Fantasy
perspective, and doesn't seem to be as involved in New Orleans' offense
this season. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Westbrook (hip) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Dallas. He
could finally have a decent game against the Cowboys, but we don't advise
starting him outside of larger leagues. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Alexander continues to be a disappointment to Fantasy owners. He's only
good for one or two receptions per game, and his yardage totals are always
minimal. He's not worth starting this week Dallas, and may be better off
left on the waiver wire. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Dallas secondary on
Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in
larger leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Giants
secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your
starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Heap remains questionable for Sunday's game because of an ankle injury.
Don't bother adding him to your active roster this week. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to
ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against CB Jason
Sehorn and the questionable N.Y. Giants secondary. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Faulk will have another big game this weekend, despite facing a tough N.Y.
Giants defense. He's the top Fantasy player in the league and a must-start
every week. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Conwell (concussion) is probable for Sunday's game against the New York
Giants. He's been a reliable option for Fantasy owners and is worth
starting against the G-Men. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a
a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York
Giants on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Nick Goings, RB CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Goings seems to have slipped to No. 3 on the running back depth chart in
Carolina. He won't see much playing time against New Orleans, so don't
bother using him. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Weinke may find life tough against a solid New Orleans defense on Sunday.
He's worth considering in larger leagues, but we wouldn't advise starting
him if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Hayes is listed as probable for Sunday's game against New Orleans due to an
ankle injury. He'll likely be in the starting lineup, however, but it'll be
tough to post solid numbers against the Saints. He's worth considering in
larger leagues only. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/12/01
Walls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league
Fantasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start
against New Orleans. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Muhammad faces a tough New Orleans secondary this weekend, but he's still
too good to consider benching outside of smaller leagues. He is also one of
the more consistent receivers in the league, and should be in your starting
lineup on a weekly basis. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Jeffers (knee) could see some action in Sunday's game against New Orleans.
However, he isn't worth starting Fantasy-wise. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Huntley will backup Tshimanga Biakabutuka in this weekend's game against
New Orleans. He'll split carries at best, and isn't worth starting
Fantasy-wise. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Biakabutuka is expected to get the start this weekend against New Orleans.
However, we'd advise reserving him if your roster allows you to play a back
with a better matchup. 

Dorsey Levens, RB GB - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no
real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Green has been one of the best backs in the league thus far, but he could
struggle against Baltimore's vaulted defense. If you have a deep group of
running backs, you may want to consider reserving the Packers' tailback. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/12/01
You might want to consider benching Favre against the ferocious Baltimore
defense this week. He's been great thus far, but if there's ever a game
where he might struggle, it's this contest against the Ravens. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Schroeder has been great for Fantasy owners thus far, but he'll take a step
back against Baltimore. If you can afford to reserve him, it might be a
good idea to do exactly that. 

Herman Moore, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Moore has done nothing so far, and we don't expect him to be a reliable
Fantasy player this season. Unless you're desperate, we'd recommend
benching or releasing him. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Stewart may not post huge rushing numbers against Minnesota, but he's still
worth starting Fantasy-wise. His numbers are being hampered by Detroit's
struggling offense, but it's tough to bench him considering the lack of
quality backs in the league. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Crowell had a decent outing against St. Louis, but he's still not reliable
enough to consider as an everyday starter. Unless you play in deeper
league, we'd advise benching Crowell this week. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 10/12/01
Morton has developed into the Lions' No. 1 receiver this season, and is
worth taking a chance on against Minnesota's mediocre secondary. If you pay
in a deeper league and don't have more reliable options, Morton is
definittly worth considering this week. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Collins has struggled the past few weeks, but he has the chance to be very
productive against St. Louis this weekend. The Giants could fall behind
early, so Collins might be asked to throw the ball 30-plus times in the
game. He's worth starting if you don't have a more reliable option. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Hilliard will be the Giants' No. 3 receiving option this weekend against
St. Louis. He's still coming back from foot surgery and probably won't get
enough playing time to warrant a starting spot on your Fantasy team at this
point.

Hi Paul,
 
Ran into ""Tim"" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our ""get together"" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
 
Take care,
Debbe.

Latest NFL Player News

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective
at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to
prove himself as a Fantasy player.

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was
good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games
this year and has become a major scoring threat even though he is not very
effective outside of the red zone.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a
touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however,
but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona.
Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a
starting nod every week. 

Doug Chapman, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers
were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so
far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot
stay healthy or continues to struggle.

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131
yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league
and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards
of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with
any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107
yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to
start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/21/01
Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on
Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's
still one of the top Fantasy players in the league. 

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a
score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a
Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Griese (shoulder) started Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was
ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions
in Denver's 27-10 loss. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the
potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not
find the end zone often. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran
runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.

David Terrell, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus
Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the
Chicago passing game.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly
establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears'
featured back for the rest of the year.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/21/01
Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit. Despite some
quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE,
especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to
Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but
he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/21/01
McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He
completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate,
possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a
reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production
this year. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The
speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good
numbers from him every week.

Alge Crumpler, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans.
Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the
year.

Albert Connell, WR NO - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is
definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the
Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate
Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/21/01
Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still
making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is
limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week,
but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh
defense.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards
and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his
potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position
lacking quality players. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed
a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout
should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He
also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile
good numbers against any defense.

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of
total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be
short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a
score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the
No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a
Fantasy perspective. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Banks finally had a somewhat productive game on Sunday, throwing for 346
yards and a score against Carolina. His performance doesn't make him any
more valuable from a Fantasy perspective, however, so don't consider him
any better than a reserve. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
Muhammad was somewhat limited during Sunday's game against Washington due
to a nagging rib injury. He caught only two passes for 27 yards in the
contest, and may have cost some Fantasy owners a victory this week. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Jackson had a surprisingly productive game against Baltimore, rushing for
77 yards and a score. The rookie seems to be all the way back from a
nagging rib injury, and is slowly becoming a good Fantasy player. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
Crowell was carted off the field in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game
with a knee injury. According to published reports, he is likely out for
the season. Larry Foster will probably become Detroit's No. 2 receiver for
the remainder of the year.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Harrison had a huge game against New England, posting eight catches for 157
yards and a score. It wasn't enough to win, however, as the Patriots blew
out the Colts, 38-17. 

 Colts, DT IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
The Colts defense continues to be horrendous, surrending 38 points to Tom
Brady and the New England Patriots on Sunday. At this point, the only
Fantasy value this unit offers is if you have offensive players facing them
in the coming weeks. 

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Brown had a huge game against Indianapolis, catching eight passes for 120
yards and a score. He continues to establish himself as a reliable Fantasy
player, and may even better once Terry Glenn returns from a hamstring
injury. 

Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Kennison suffered an apparent head/neck injury during the first quarter of
Sunday's game against San Diego. He left the contest but later returned to
action. 

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/21/01
Patten had a record-setting game against Indianapolis on Sunday. The
wideout had four total touchdowns (two receiving, one passing and one
rushing) as the Patriots took out the Colts, 38-17. Patten will likely be
moved to third on the depth chart once Terry Glenn returns, but he's
certainly worth a roster spot at this point. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Banks left Sunday's game against Carolina in the fourth quarter due to a
hand injury. Kent Graham replaced Banks for a play, but he did return. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Biakabutuka left Sunday's game against Washington in the fourth quarter
after sustaining a foot injury. He didn't return to the game, and X-rays
later revealed a break. He did put up 150 yards of total offense and a
touchdown before sustaining the injury, but that may have been his last
game of the season. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/21/01
Schroeder will be inactive for Sunday's game at Minnesota. Corey Bradford
is expected to start in his place.

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Testaverde was replaced by Chad Pennington in the second half of Sunday's
game against St. Louis. The move wasn't injury related, but simply Jets'
coach Herm Edwards giving Pennington some playing time in a blowout game.
Testaverde finished the afternoon 9-of-13 for 74 yards with a touchdown and
an interception. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Grbac suffered a chest injury during the second half of Sunday's game
against Cleveland. Randall Cunningham took over for Grbac, who did not
return to the game. Grbac's status for next weekend's game against
Jacksonville is uncertain. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
Allen left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a calf injury. Jason
Brookins received most of the carries in Allen's absence. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game against Baltimore with an undisclosed injury.
He was replaced by rookie Quincy Morgan. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Chrebet suffered his second concussion in as many weeks during Sunday's
game against St. Louis. The Jets' wideout did not return to the game and
will be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Robinson suffered an apparently serious knee injury in the second quarter
of Sunday's game. He was carted off the field and will not return. The
initial diagnosis was a sprain, although the injury appeared to be more
serious.

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Bennett has now been listed as inactive for Sunday's game against Green
Bay. Doug Chapman will start at tailback for the Vikings in his absence. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Jeffers (knees) has been ruled out of the game against Washington. He has
been practicing recently, and could return to action in the near future,
though.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/21/01
Richardson (shoulder) will not play this week against the Cardinals. Priest
Holmes will continue to see a full workload as the Chiefs' featured back.

Torrance Small, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
According to published reports, Small has been released by the New England
Patriots. It is the second time this season that the team has cut Small,
who was likely let go due to Terry Glenn's return from a suspension. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
According to the <I>Florida Times-Union</I>, Taylor will miss the Jags'
Oct. 28 contest against Baltimore. Head Coach Tom Coughlin would not offer
up a timetable for Taylor's return, so Fantasy owners must continue to play
the waiting game. 

Doug Chapman, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
Chapman has officially been named the Vikings' starting tailback for
Sunday's game against Green Bay. He may lose carries in the red zone to
Travis Prentice, but Chapman is still worth starting if you're desperate
for a running back this week. 

Quincy Morgan, WR CLE - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Morgan will drop down to the No. 3 receiver on the depth chart this weekend
against Baltimore. Dennis Northcutt is finally healthy and will make the
start, but neither receiver is worth starting from a Fantasy perspective. 

Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
According to published reports, Northcutt will start ahead of rookie Quincy
Morgan on Sunday. Cleveland will be facing a fired up Ravens' defense,
however, so starting any Browns' wideout this week is risky. 

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Chrebet (concussion) completed his first full practice of the week on
Friday, according to the <I>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</I>. He's expected to
start against the Rams on Sunday, but he may have trouble facing CB Aeneas
Willliams, so we'd recommend reserving him if possible. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
According to the <I>Tampa Tribune</I>, Dunn has missed some practice time
this week due to his sprained foot. He is expected to start on Sunday
against Pittsburgh, however, so Fantasy owners should have no hesitation in
starting him this week. 

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford is expected to start in place of the injured Bill Schroeder on
Sunday against Minnesota. He's worth taking a chance on in deeper leagues,
but don't expect him to post Schroeder-like numbers. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/21/01
Schroeder (ankle) has been downgraded to questionable for Sunday's game
against Minnesota. He'll almost certainly be replaced by Corey Bradford in
the starting lineup, so starting him from a Fantasy perspective is a risky
move. 

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Wilkins (ribs) is out for Sunday's game against New England, and may be
lost until November 4. With Jerome Pathon ailing as well, rookie Reggie
Wayne will be the No. 2 receiver for the Colts. 

Jermaine Lewis, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
According to the <I>Baltimore Sun</I>, Lewis (hamstring) has not been 100
percent healthy this season. He's expected to play on Sunday against
Cleveland, however, but he's not worth starting outside of deeper Fantasy
leagues. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Heap (ankle) practiced on Friday and is expected to play on Sunday against
Cleveland. He's worth starting in deeper leagues, but the presence of
Shannon Sharpe will keep him from being productive on a consistent basis. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Mason (ankle) is expected to start on Sunday against Detroit. With the
Lions' secondary in shambles, starting Mason is a good decision for Fantasy
owners with a thin group of receivers. 

Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Kinney is dealing with a slight calf strain, but he's expected to play on
Sunday against Detroit. With Frank Wycheck in the picture, it's tough to
depend on Kinney to produce consistently, so benching him is advisable. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Moore (hamstring) missed practice on Friday and has been downgraded to out
for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Keep him on reserve if he's
currently on your roster

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Griese (shoulder) will start Sunday's game against the San Diego Chargers.
He has practiced with the first team offense all week, and seemed to have
no problems mechanically. These AFC West games tend to be high scoring, so
starting Griese is advisable. 

 Lions, DT DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Defensive back Bryant Westbrook has been listed as out for Sunday's game
against Tennessee. This could mean big things for Steve McNair and the
Titans' passing game, who should have an easy time beating Detroit's
corners on a regular basis. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/21/01
According to published reports, Glenn has been declared inactive for
Sunday's game against Indianapolis. Glenn is dealing with a hamstring
injury that he sustained last week, and he is not yet 100 percent. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
According to the <I>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</I>, Faulk has been ruled out
for Sunday's game against the New York Jets. Faulk missed his third
straight practice on Friday, so the team will go with Trung Canidate as the
featured back. 

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect much from Alstott this week. Warrick Dunn is healthy enough to
start again, and will be the featured back against Pittsburgh.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Morton could have a big game this weekend against Tennessee. The Titans'
secondary has been shaky at best, so the positive matchup makes Morton a
good start from a Fantasy perspective. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Stewart will have a hard time racking up good Fantasy stats Sunday against
a Tennessee linebacking corps that can cover a lot of ground. Start him
only if you don't have two other backs on your team with better matchups.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Chamberlain is definitely a good start this week. He will become a major
factor if the Packers focus too much on Minnesota's wide receivers.

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Booker would make an excellent Fantasy starter in his game Sunday against
the Bengals. Cincinnati is without cornerback Rodney Heath, which will make
it difficult to defend Booker this week.

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/19/01
Expect good numbers from Carter this week. He is a big-game player who will
not be flustered by the improved Green Bay defense.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/19/01
Robinson battled a back injury in Week Five, but he should rebound on
Sunday against Cincinnati. The Bears will need to make some deep passes and
we think Robinson would make a solid Fantasy starter this week.

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Green Bay's defense has played well so far, but Culpepper won't be
intimidated by the Packers. He has faced them many times before, and should
fare well in an important divisional game in front of the home crowd.

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Miller will need to throw the deep ball often Sunday against the
overaggressive Bengals. He should post adequate Fantasy numbers, making him
a solid starter if you don't have any other superstar QBs to choose from.

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/19/01
Green will get the bulk of his numbers in the second half if Green Bay can
get ahead of Minnesota early. He will definitely be good for at least one
TD.

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
Favre should have another excellent game this week. Minnesota's secondary
will not be able to handle him, especially with CB Robert Tate ailing.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/19/01
Dunn sat out practice Thursday with a sprained right big toe, but is
expected to play Sunday against Pittsburgh. He faces a tough challenge in
the Steelers' stingy rush defense, so consider reserving him if you have a
more established back on your roster.

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Schroeder missed practice for a second straight day Thursday due to an
ankle injury. However, he is listed as probable on the injury report, and
you should probably start him this week unless he takes a turn for the
worse before gametime.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/19/01
Moss practiced Thursday for the first time since aggravating an ankle
injury on Sunday, and has been upgraded from questionable to probable on
the injury report for Sunday's game against Green Bay. You should
definitely get him into your active Fantasy lineup as a result.

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Matthews could serve as the backup quarterback for the Bears Sunday in
Cincinnati after throwing in drills Thursday. Don't bother with him, as
he's not going to get much playing time the rest of the season behind Jim
Miller on the depth chart.

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Baxter practiced Thursday and hopes to be able to play Sunday in
Cincinnati, according to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>. He has been
recovering from a neck injury, but isn't worth your Fantasy attention.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Griese (shoulder) practiced with the first-team offense, and looked good,
Mike Shanahan told the <I>Denver Post</i>. He is expected to start against
San Diego. ""I think he did pretty good,"" coach Mike Shanahan said. ""He
practiced the whole practice. It didn't look like there was anything wrong.
I'm not sure how painful it is because I haven't talked to him, but so far,
so good."" 

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Wilkins (ribs) is not expected to play against the Patriots. He is listed
as doubtful.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/19/01
The effects of a concussion suffered against Miami has kept Chrebet out of
practices this week. He is expected to play against St. Louis.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/19/01
Redmond (ankle) is expected to be in uniform for Sunday's game. But it
appears he will not be used much, because New England has found Antowain
Smith to be a dependable back.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/19/01
Clark should get open often against San Diego. The Chargers' pass defense
can definitely be exploited over the middle.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/19/01
Smith should have another fine game this week. He will be the focal point
of the Denver passing game in a contest that will feature a lot of offense.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Anderson may find it difficult to reach 100 yards against the Chargers. San
Diego has a strong front seven, and the Broncos are having trouble with
blocking on end runs.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Jones has been a disappointment so far, but he could be a factor this week,
as the Chargers trade blows with the Broncos in a high-scoring game.

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/19/01
Graham should produce good numbers this week. The Chargers will probably
engage in a high-scoring game with the Broncos.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/19/01
Gonzalez will be a prime target against the Cardinals. Kansas City will
certainly see many passing openings over the middle. 

Chris Thomas, WR KC - Uran Man Updated 10/19/01
Thomas has moved into Kansas City's starting lineup. Don't use him unless
you are desperate for help at receiver.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/19/01
The matchup suggests Alexander will do well this week, but the Chiefs will
probably look to keep the ball on the ground, limiting Kansas City's
passing numbers.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/19/01
Don't expect Wycheck to catch a lot of passes this weekend. He hasn't been
featured too heavily in the Titans' passing game and has been used more to
block for running back Eddie George. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/19/01
Mason is suffering from an ankle injury and is listed as questionable for
this week's game against the Lions. Tennessee expects him to play but don't
rely on him being too productive. The injury caused him to miss last week's
game.

Subject: RE: Match.com - You've Got Mail: Hello Again!
I would tell people, and in fact have told people.  The way I figure it
is that as long as I try and have fun with it, it will be fun, and if it
gets out of hand I'll quit.  I just started with this also.  I had a
female friend that got involved with something like this and than
totally freaked out when people found out.  So, when I signed up I
called to tell her what I had done.  She thought I was messing with her
and got mad again.  Since then she has realized I was serious and now, I
feel, she has become less serious about the whole deal.
 
Anyway,  the reason I signed up was that it seems like a good idea.  You
can meet new people without sticking your neck out too far.  So what
about you, where do you work and live, what part of town?  What do you
do in your spare time?  Etc?

"Re: halloween","OK that whole bra comment...MEAN!  You know I'm sensitive about my little breasts!  I've been working on the girls about the limo.  I think they're coming around.  It would be much less expensive to go the limo way in my opinion.  Plus, I'm not crazy about running around in the cold since I  won't be wearing much!

Update!  Jeff the DUI guy wants to party, so no go on the driving.  Like I guessed, Nat and Lorena are going to pass on the limo.  So, taxi is probably the best bet.  We're meeting at Nat's place in the early evening to ""get ready"" and then planning to hit the bars and maybe a couple of parties.  Are you going to join us?   Do you know of anything going on?

Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.

Latest NFL Player News

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Green should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But
the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.

Ken Dilger, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore.
Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this
week.

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once
again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New
England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this
week.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Wayne is expected to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the
second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in
your Fantasy lineup.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned
Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against
New England.

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was
intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against
them at home this week.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle.
He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green
Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether
he will be able to play.

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving
treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding
whether to use him this week.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might
have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff
didn't hurt him last week.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts
this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in
his second meeting with Indianapolis.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good
week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky
start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down
by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his
downfield speed.

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets
will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but
he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible
offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting
Davis this week warrants consideration. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18
passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't
even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a
decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers
in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can
be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first
interception of the year.

Walter Rasby, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen
Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at
this point. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary
on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in
larger leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets
secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your
starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to
ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the
questionable N.Y. Jets secondary. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this
season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more
reliable tight end on your roster. 

Trung Canidate, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Canidate will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back
this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams'
offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a
a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York
Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the
majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid
will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the
more productive of the two backs. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth
starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and
around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/18/01
Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this
season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit
suspect at this point. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial
collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley
will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for
Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on
Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and
should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Thrash has been somewhat of a bust thus far, and isn't worth starting on a
consistent basis Fantasy-wise. As a result, don't play the Eagles' wideout
unless he proves that he can be more reliable. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Dayne has emerged as New York's main threat in the backfield, and has been
relatively productive in the role. Even with Tiki Barber back in the mix,
we expect Dayne to get the majority of the carries in the game. He'll have
a tough time running on the Eagles' defense, however, be he's still worth
starting in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Barber (hamstring) is listed as probable for Monday's game against
Philadelphia. He'll be used in the same capacity he was prior to the
injury, splitting time with Ron Dayne. We'd avoid using Barber if possible
as a result, especially in smaller leagues. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Richardson (shoulder) has returned to practice, and is expected to play
against Arizona. He might take away some carries from Priest Holmes, but
Holmes has clearly become Kansas City's top ground option.

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Collins has been mediocre at best this season, but his numbers against
Philadelphia were respectable in 2000. He's not the best option
Fantasy-wise, but you could do worse if you're desperate for a quarterback. 

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Minnis has been replaced in Kansas City's starting lineup by Chris Thomas.
The rookie wideout has been having trouble with his route running and
communication with QB Trent Green.

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
Hilliard will continue his role as the Giants' third receiver on Monday
against Philadelphia. His decreased playing time makes it tough to
recommend starting him, but don't be surprised if Hilliard finds the end
zone against the Eagles. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Toomer will face a tough matchup on Monday night, facing CB Bobby Taylor
and the aggressive Philadelphia secondary. He's worth starting in deeper
leagues, however, but you may want to sit him should you have the advantage
of a deep group of wideouts. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Williams is silencing his critics this season and has established himself
as a top Fantasy back. He's a must-start every week Fantasy-wise,
especially against lesser defenses like Atlanta. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
This could be the week that Brooks breaks out of his semi-slump. Brooks
will be facing an Atlanta defense that is dead last in the league against
the pass, so the matchup is certainly in his favor. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Pathon (foot) did not practice on Wednesday. He is not expected to play
against New England, and Reggie Wayne will probably start in his place for
the second consecutive week.

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Horn is a must-start this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons' secondary
is very vulnerable, so Horn should have no trouble putting up solid Fantasy
numbers. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Jackson had a down week against Carolina, but don't be surprised to see him
bounce back against Atlanta. The Falcons' secondary is one of the league's
worst, and is easily vulnerable to a big game. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Biakabutuka will be Carolina's starting tailback this weekend against
Washington. Based on the matchup, Biakabutuka is well worth starting
Fantasy-wise against a horrible Redskins' run defense. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
If Muhsin Muhammad is still being hindered by his rib injury, Hayes could
be in line for a big game against Washington. In any event, Hayes is worth
starting in deeper leagues based on the matchup. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Walls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league
Fantasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start
against Washington. 

Michael Vick, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Vick will backup Chris Chandler this weekend, and whether or not he gets
some looks in certain situations is in question. In any event, he's not
worth starting Fantasy-wise. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Smith could have a tough time against New Orleans' tough run defense on
Sunday. He should be good for a touchdown, however, but don't expect big
yardage numbers. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Chandler is quietly have a solid season, and has once again become a
productive Fantasy player. He's had some success in the past against New
Orleans, and is worth starting this week Fantasy-wise. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Martin (shoulder) is listed as out for Sunday's game against New Orleans.
His return to action is still unclear at this time, so keep him on reserve
if he's on your roster. 

Thomas Jones, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Jones will continue his backup role this weekend against Kansas City. He
doesn't get enough playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration,
so avoid using him. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Pittman seems to be okay after sustaining a concussion last weekend. He's
expected to start against Kansas City, and is worth considering
Fantasy-wise due to the Chiefs' vulnerable run defense. 

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Plummer has put up decent numbers over the first five weeks of the season,
but he's still throwing far too many interceptions. Kansas City has a solid
pass defense, so try to avoid using Plummer if at all possible. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Sanders scored his first touchdown of the year against Chicago last
weekend, but he's not a very reliable Fantasy player. Avoid using him
outside of deeper leagues. 

Terry Hardy, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Hardy has done nothing since catching two touchdowns in the first two weeks
of the season. He's unreliable Fantasy-wise, and should be used as a last
resort only. 

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Boston continues to be a reliable Fantasy player, and he'll produce good
numbers this weekend against Kansas City. Unless you have a very deep group
of receivers, Boston should be in your starting lineup. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Heap practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for Sunday's game at
Cleveland. Reserve Heap on your roster this week. It would be wise to keep
him inactive until he is effective in a game. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a
football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is
dealing with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps
and bruises. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game
on Oct. 28 against Chicago. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/18/01
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's
secondary is thin because of injuries.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills
to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend
might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an
injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE
Jay Riemersma.

Drew Bledsoe, QB NE - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
There's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency
quarterback this week . Bledsoe was upgraded from ""out"" to ""doubtful"" on
the injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run,
throw or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would
just hand off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are
sidelined. Bledsoe's progress has been slower than he hoped and there's no
timetable for his return. 

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly miss
the next game because of an injured right knee. ""Tyrone Wheatley has a
second degree - I don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,""'
coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday. Gruden called Wheatley questionable for
the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about the
injury as the week progressed. He disputed reports that Wheatley would be
out four weeks. ""I would not agree with that at this time,"" Gruden said. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain whether he will play
in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more
serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke
had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert
said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would
start if Weinke cannot play.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's confident
he'll play Sunday against San Diego. Griese complained of shoulder soreness
after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was
aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks
defensive end Lamar King. Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his
shoulder. 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained
ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is
in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green
would replace Smoot if he's unable to go. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas
City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised
if his status is downgraded over the next two days. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to
play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to
start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/17/01
Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's
game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he
may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week,
Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head
Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday
against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good
choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. 

Terance Mathis, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/17/01
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on
Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues
from a Fantasy perspective. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in
the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable
to use Fantasy-wise. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was
filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his
swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in
Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become
Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but
his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a
right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis
Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/17/01
Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a
right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week,
this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes
completely clear he will start.

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB
job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup
Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head
Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend
you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to
recommend you start any Broncos running back.

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/17/01
Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too
productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars'
previous. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked
like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well
this week and catch a lot of passes. 

Sean Dawkins, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of
couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/17/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in
Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is
listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only
has five catches this season. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several
passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Herman Moore, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his
hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is
much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We
believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the
muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team. Larry Foster assumes
the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with
a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to
Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Contra-Costa Times</i> points out Garner has apparently supplanted
Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent
before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee
injury.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Henry told the <i>Buffalo News</i> he plans to have minor surgery on both
knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not
affect him during the regular season.

Jay Riemersma, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says the Bills want to get Riemersma more involved
in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are healthy
again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the year, but
he will now become more involved in the passing game.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this week against the
Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reggie Wayne would
start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.

Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The <i>Miami Herald</i> says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he
had a problem with stress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will
return.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
According to the <I>Dallas Morning Star</I>, Smith could end up splitting
more carries with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo
believes the two backs complement each other very well, and that the move
will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Alexander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which
revealed a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action
due to the injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/17/01
Pittman, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is
expected to practice on Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against
Kansas City is questionable, but he is expected to play. 

Greg Clark, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Clark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on
his right hamstring three weeks ago. ""It was encouraging,"" Clark told the
<I>Contra Costa Times</I>. ""I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of
that before the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The
most I could do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in
comparison."" Head Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be
healthy enough to make his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out
for their Oct. 28 game against Chicago. 

 Giants, DT NYG - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
Defensive tackle Keith Hamilton suffered a separated shoulder during
Sunday's game against St. Louis, but he is expected to play on Monday night
against Philadelphia. Linebacker Mike Barrow has a hip pointer, but should
be able to play in the game as well with some extra padding. CB Will Allen
has a sprained ankle, and his status against the Eagles is questionable at
this point. 

Ryan Leaf, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
According to the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>, Leaf will get his chance to
win the starting QB job in the next few weeks. ""If we're going to get an
evaluation on him, this is the open window,"" coach Dave Campo said. ""At
this point, I don't know if he's going to be any more than the third
quarterback, but this is the window of opportunity."" In any event, Leaf's
value as a Fantasy player will be very minimal. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/17/01
Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order
to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his
status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Reggie Swinton, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Swinton (hamstring) will not practice this week in order to rest his
injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for
the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Robert Thomas, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Thomas had an MRI performed on his sprained left ankle Monday, and is now
expected to miss the remainder of the season. Thomas has no real Fantasy
value at this point.

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Latest NFL Player News

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/23/01
Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to
start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of
his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham
doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be
signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3
receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has
been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to
Fantasy glory. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/23/01
McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He
played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be
a solid No. 1 QB.

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/23/01
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's
game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with
extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not
be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No.
1 Fantasy QB. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He
left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the
game.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a
hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.

Fred Beasley, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of
the regular season. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a
must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't
depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in
place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help
Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the
weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you
need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.
Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player
on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best
wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him
during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be
a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper
league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too
talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead
your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start
during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2
wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during
the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2
during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not
accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid
Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2
wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the
NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not
in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into
your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider
him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch
a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be
a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless
your team is very thin at wide receiver. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless
you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't
recommended. 

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a
reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best
during your playoffs. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his
yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD
reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your
playoffs.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be
very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Coles has been New York's best receiver this year. He will continue to be a
consistent TD threat during the Fantasy postseason. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Miller has been inconsistent this season. Starting Miller is too huge a
gamble in the Fantasy playoffs. 

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Martin will be a key player in many Fantasy championship drives. Keep him
in your lineup throughout the rest of the season. 

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Booker has been one of the better receivers in the NFC. Look for him to
produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. 

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Chambers may start this week because Oronde Gadsden will be less than 100
percent healthy with a hamstring injury. He will continue to be a regular
TD threat during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Pittman has been inconsistent as a Fantasy player. Don't rely on him too
much during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 12/21/01
Plummer has played well this season. He should be an adequate QB during the
Fantasy playoffs. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Williams (ribs) is now listed as probable. He has been practicing with no
apparent problems. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
According to the <i>Pro Football News and Injury Report</i>, Davis' status
for Sunday's game is questionable right now. He has told reporters he will
play, but Ki-Jana Carter will start in his place if Davis can't play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hakim has a sore back. He is expected to play against Carolina. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Faulk has a minor knee problem. He is listed as probable for this week's
game. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Bruce (foot) missed Thursday's practice. He is listed as probable for this
week. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Owens (hip) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Garcia (ribs) returned to practice on Thursday. ""We didn't do too much with
him but just enough to make him feel somewhat confident about making
progress this week. The important thing will be how he feels tomorrow, does
he become real sore,"" Steve Mariucci told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""I
didn't notice any wincing. I didn't see any grimacing. I saw him throw a
couple of frozen ropes."" Garcia is expected to play this week. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Bouman worked on a limited basis in practice on Thursday. There is a chance
Spergon Wynn may start in his place this week, and that decision may be
made on Friday. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Parker may miss this week's game with a shoulder injury. He has not been a
reliable Fantasy player this year when healthy. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Holmes returned to practice on Thursday. He should assume his regular
workload this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Franks (ankle) has returned to practice. He is expected to play on Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Gadsden (hamstring) has returned to practice, but Chris Chambers may start
over him this week. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Muhammad (toe) did not practice on Thursday. He might miss the game against
Buffalo, and Isaac Byrd will start in his place if Muhammad can't play. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Walls (ankle) practiced on Thursday. He might be able to play against
Buffalo. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Price (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Wycheck started off slow this season but has been productive in recent
weeks. Expect him to contribute a fair amount of points during the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Christian missed practice with tightness in his calf on Thursday. His
current status is day to day. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
George is listed as questionable for Saturday's game because of an ankle
injury, but is expected to play. Look for him to be productive this week
against a weak Raider run defense. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Look for Dyson to be a decent No. 2 receiver during the Fantasy postseason.
He might not score, but he should catch a few passes. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Mason is expected to play Saturday, despite suffering from a hip injury.
Look for him to be an adequate No. 2 wideout. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Ward hasn't scored a lot of touchdowns this season but is among the league
leaders in receptions. He should be an asset to your team for the rest of
the season as a No. 2 wideout. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Burress has been more reliable in recent weeks but still remains a risky
pick for the Fantasy playoffs. He will only be a good No. 2 wideout at
best. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect
him to be too productive during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Mack has produced an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't
scored a lot. He should be used in larger leagues only for the remaining
weeks. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
McCardell has caught a lot of passes this season but he doesn't score too
many touchdowns. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 receiver in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith has been one of the best receivers in the AFC this season, despite
his offseason injury. The veteran is a must-start for your Fantasy playoff
run. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Couch has been inconsistent this season. He is far too unreliable to be
considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has been solid all season. Look for him to be a good receiver
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Grbac has been inconsistent at times this season but should still be an
adequate starter during the Fantasy playoffs. Expect him throw for at least
200 yards and a touchdown. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Ismail has been a reliable receiver all season. Look for this trend to
continue throughout the Fantasy playoffs. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Taylor is not expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a groin
injury that has sidelined him for most of the season. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Dillon missed practice Thursday because of a finger injury but <i>The
Cincinnati Post</i> reports that he is expected to play Sunday. Even if
healthy, Dillon is a risky start this week against a tough Baltimore run
defense. Consider benching him if you have a backup of equal value. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Kitna, still recovering from a finger injury, is not at full strength. He
will start Sunday but has not been productive enough to use in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Scott Covington, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
The Bengals have signed Covington to their roster. Covington will backup
Jon Kitna this week. However, Covington is not worth using even if he
receives playing time. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Brunell is expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a quadriceps
injury that has limited his abilities over the past month. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
McNair missed practice Thursday for the third straight day because of back
spasms and is questionable for the game against Oakland. McNair first
experienced some stiffness in his lower back late last week. In the first
quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles tightened
up. However, he stayed in the game. Even McNair is unsure of his status for
Saturday night. ""If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it,""
he said. ""I'm very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time
the spasms have stayed longer than I anticipated."" Avoid using McNair this
week if you have a backup of equal value. His health status makes him a
major risk. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
The Cleveland Browns put Jackson on injured reserve on Thursday. Jackson,
who leads the team with 554 yards rushing, will miss the rest of the season
with an ankle injury. He aggravated a left ankle sprain in the first
quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and left the
game with two carries for six yards. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White will
share carries in his absence, but neither are reliable players to use
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Sharpe (leg) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Drew Brees, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/20/01
There still seems to be a chance Brees might play this week or before the
season ends, says the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i>. He has been taking
snaps with the first team in practice. ""I'm not going to say that he will
play, (but) could he play? Yes,"" Mike Riley. ""But I'm not going to say he
will for sure. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the
Niners' goal-line back, says the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""It's a
coincidence,"" Barlow said. ""It was my turn in the rotation to be in there.""
The two backs will continue to split carries. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Owens (hip) did not practice on Wednesday. He is still expected to play
this week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/20/01
Garcia (ribs) has been downgraded to questionable, but he still expects to
play this week. Tim Rattay took snaps with the first team on Wednesday. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
The <I>New York Daily News</i> says the pain in Hilliard's toe has
worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play
against Seattle. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Moss (quadriceps) has returned to practice. He might be able to play this
week.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/20/01
McNair has missed some practice time this week because of a back injury. He
is still expected to start. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Bouman (thumb) missed practice on Wednesday. He is expected to play this
week, although the <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i> says he might have to
throw in pain. ""We think he'll be practicing full speed on Thursday and
Friday,"" Dennis Green said. ""I think he'll get accustomed to how he's got
to throw the ball and I think he will be effective.""

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Wilkins will sit out again this week with a hamstring injury. Reggie Wayne
will be the No. 2 receiver against the Jets. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
McKnight is listed as probable for this week's game with a back injury. He
is expected to play against New England. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01

Crude Oil Futures Fall on Profit Taking

Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.52 to 
$19.28 per barrel yesterday in some late pre-holiday profit taking. 
Heavy selling set in late as speculative funds bet against OPEC's 
ability to shore up crude prices in the face of an economic slump 
that has zapped demand. The sell-off occurred despite the increased 
likelihood that OPEC will proceed with a 1.5 million bpd reduction in 
exports. Oman has raised their production cut pledge from 25,000 bpd 
to 40,000 bpd, leaving non-OPEC producers just 37,500 bpd short of 
the cartels demand that they slice a combined 500,000 bpd from 
output. Many say that OPEC is unlikely to bicker over the relatively 
small shortfall. Crude prices had risen earlier in the week as colder 
temperatures in the Northeast lowered petroleum stockpiles. Forecasts 
that Northeastern temperatures will be near or below normal over the 
Christmas holiday provided support for the market. Gasoline and 
distillate inventories fell during the week of December 14th, 
according to data released by the EIA and API. Gasoline futures for 
January delivery on the NYMEX lost 0.0078 to $0.5503 per gallon. 
January heating oil futures on the NYMEX fell $ 0.0164 to $0.5449 per 
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for February delivery on 
the IPE were down $0.34 to $19.13 per barrel.

Conoco Acquires Statoil's Vietnamese Offshore Interests 


    Conoco has agreed with Norway's Statoil to purchase a portion of 
its interests in the $1.3 billion Nam Con Son natural gas project, 
offshore Vietnam, raising Conoco's total acreage position in Vietnam 
to 6.05 million gross acres, or 3.2 million net. The purchase 
included Statoil's 50% interest in Block 05.3, extending over 462,000 
acres. BP holds the remaining 50% percent interest. Conoco also 
acquired Statoil subsidiary, Statoil Vietnam, which owns a 16.33% 
stake of the 240 mile Nam Con Son pipeline to move natural gas to an 
industrial complex near Ho Chi Minh City. Other stakeholders in the 
pipeline are BP with 32.67%, who will turn over operatorship to 51% 
owner, PetroVietnam after the first 5 years of production. Natural 
gas delivery is scheduled to begin next year. The company currently 
is the largest acreage holder of any foreign energy company in 
Vietnam. Conoco's current total production in Vietnam is about 50,000 
bpd of oil equivalent, or 10,000 bpd net, from the Rang Dong Field in 
Block 15-2 in the Cuu Long Basin. Added future production is expected 
when the Sutu Den Field in Block 15-1, also in the Cuu Long Basin, 
comes on-stream in late 2003. Early estimates of Sutu Den's initial 
future production are around 65,000 bpd.

Conoco to Clean Up Oil Refinery Pollution


    Conoco has reached an agreement with the Justice Department to 
spend  $95 million - $110 million on pollution control equipment at 
its oil refineries. The DOJ has reached similar deals with Navajo 
Refining and Montana Refining, subsidiaries of Holly Corp, to spend  
$16 million - $21 million for pollution controls at their refineries. 
The settlements are part of the EPA's effort to reduce air emissions 
from refineries. The agreement affects Conoco's refineries located in 
Lake Charles, Louisiana; Ponca City, Oklahoma; Commerce City, 
Colorado and Billings, Montana. Conoco will also pay a $1.5 million 
fine under the Clean Air Act and spend about $5 million on 
environmental projects in communities around the refineries. The new 
environmental projects will reduce annual emissions of nitrogen oxide 
by about 3,210 tons, sulfur dioxide by 4,000 tons, volatile organic 
compounds by 100 tons and particulate matter by 400 tons. Navajo and 
Montana Refining will pay a $750,000 civil penalty and spend about 
$1.5 million on environmental projects. The government has reached 
similar agreements over the past year with Motiva Enterprises, 
Equilon Enterprises, Deer Park Refining Limited Partnership, Marathon 
Ashland Petroleum, Koch Petroleum Group, BP, Amoco and Arco.

Oman Paves Way for OPEC Cut


    An announcement by Oman that it will increase its production cut 
commitment from 25,000 bpd to 40,000 bpd, seemingly assures that OPEC 
will proceed with a plan to remove 2 million bpd from the world oil 
market as of January 1st in order to support sagging crude oil 
prices. OPEC members have said they will cut exports by 1.5 million 
bpd, but only on the condition that non-aligned producing countries 
also reduce production by 500,000 bpd. Oman's announcement raises the 
non-member total to 462,500 bpd. Insiders say that OPEC would be 
unlikely to quibble over the shortfall. The average price for the 
cartels basket of crudes was $17.80 on Wednesday, far below their 
target range of $22  $28 per barrel. OPEC's official quota is 23.2 
million bpd, but the cartels members have yet to reach compliance 
with the quota since it went into effect on September 1st.

Iraq to Renew Oil Agreement with Jordan
  
    Iraq's Oil Minister says there was no obstacle to renewing its 
annual oil agreement with Jordan. The minister of the 2 countries met 
to renew the annual oil agreement with Iraq worth more than $700 
million. Iraq has agreed to supply Jordan with 5.5 million tonnes of 
crude oil and petroleum products next year. Jordan's oil purchases 
from Iraq are exempted from UN sanctions. Earlier this month, Jordan 
said it was seeking bids from foreign firms to build a pipeline to 
transport Iraqi crude to its sole refinery that would replace the 
current cumbersome export of crude by trucks. It is planned that the 
$350 million pipeline will extend from the Iraqi pumping station in 
Haditha, 160 miles northwest of Baghdad to Jordan's refinery of 
Zarga, northeast of Amman.

Korean Refinery Utilizes ExxonMobil Sulfur Removing Process 
  
    ExxonMobil Research and Engineering has announced the license and 
successful startup of SCANfining, ExxonMobil's proprietary gasoline 
sulfur reduction process, at LG-Caltex's Yosu, Korea refinery. 
SCANfining selectively removes sulfur from catalytically cracked 
naphtha with little octane loss. SCANfining, which uses a 
proprietary, selective catalyst, RT 225, jointly developed by EMRE 
and Akzo Nobel Catalysts, reduces the loss of octane-rich olefins and 
hydrogen consumption. The LG-Caltex SCANfining unit processes 20,000 
bpd of catalytic naphtha. SCANfining was retrofitted into an existing 
naphtha hydrotreater, requiring minimal capital investment. The 
retrofitting was accomplished in 2 months. LG-Caltex, a joint venture 
between the Koreas LG Group and ChevronTexaco, is one of Korea's 
largest oil refiners and petrochemical producers, with a refinery 
capacity of 650,000 bpd of crude oil.

Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the ! st! retch.

Trent Dilfer <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasse! lb! eck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=get! ba! d&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=235122&>, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.

Jerome Pathon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=12612&>, WR IND - Team Dick ! Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they wil! l ! activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards o! n ! 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1389&>, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. 

Erron Kinney <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=12342&>, WR TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
! Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football215.fantasy.sportsli! ne! .com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football215! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1035&>, QB BAL - H! ou! ston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=12411&>, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&! ke! y=187503&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1292&>, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was! a! ble to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=12050.9&random=3589&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

Latest NFL Player News

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Mason worked out in the beginning of practice Wednesday but his ankle was
so sore that he had to stop. He is listed as questionable for this week's
game. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/11/01
George did some light running, but did not practice Wednesday. ""Eddie was
better by the end of practice. He is still sore,"" head coach Jeff Fisher
told <i>The Tennessean</i>. ""He is doing more than what I thought he would
do considering where he was after the game."" Fisher also added that George
would be a game-time decision if he doesn't practice on Thursday or Friday.
The Titans will use Skip Hicks and Mike Green in his place if George is
inactive. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/11/01
Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice to allow a minor knee injury to heal.
He is expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Ward was held out of practice Wednesday to let a toe injury heal. He is
expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01
The Jaguars have ruled Taylor out for their next game against Buffalo on
October 18. Taylor is still recovering from the groin injury he suffered in
Week Two. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01
Warrick is suffering from a leg injury and did not practice Wednesday.
However he is listed as probable for this week's game and might resume
practicing on Thursday. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Heap's condition is more doubtful than questionable for Sunday's game,
according to <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>. Heap is still recovering from an
ankle injury and missed practice for the second consecutive day Wednesday.
Shannon Sharpe will get most of the looks at tight end if Heap is inactive. 

R.Jay Soward, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
The Jaguars got official notice Wednesday that Soward will be out another
six weeks for his second violation of the NFL substance abuse policy.
Soward, the team's first-round draft pick in 2000, missed the first four
games for his first violation. He could have returned this week, but now
won't be eligible to return until Nov. 26 -- if the Jaguars want him back
at all. ""He obviously is a young man who has outstanding talent, but he
also has a cross to bear,"" Coughlin said. ""For him to ever play again, he's
got to do something about it."" Soward could have been Jacksonville's third
receiver this season, but now his career with the team is in jeopardy. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Batch has reclaimed the starting quarterback job with the Lions. While he
can't be any worse than Ty Detmer, we don't recommend you expect either QB
to provide your team with good Fantasy stats.

Daimon Shelton, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
The Bears signed Leon Johnson to the 53-man roster on Tuesday. He would
help fill the void created by Shelton's four-game suspension, which is
under appeal. Johnson isn't an impact Fantasy player, so don't pick him up.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/10/01
Wycheck is expected to play in this week's game against the Buccaneers. He
was forced out of the team's previous game after suffering a strained neck. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/10/01
An MRI on George's ankle revealed Tuesday that his ankle injury is not a
high ankle sparin. George is expected to play in Sunday's game against
Tampa Bay and will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/10/01
Bettis is expected to play in this week's game against Kansas City but will
be listed as probable. He is recovering from a minor knee injury. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/10/01
Ward will be listed as probable for this week's game but is expected to
play. He is recovering from a toe injury. 

Sean Dawkins, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Dawkins left Sunday's game in the third quarter with a rib injury and did
not return. His status for this week's game is in doubt. Alvis Whitted will
get more playing time in his absence. 

O.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Santiago is expected to replace Rickey Dudley as the starting tight end.
Santiago hasn't caught a pass this season but will be a reasonable pickup
given the lack of talent at tight end. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Heap is still recovering from an ankle injury but might resume practicing
on Wednesday. He missed Sunday's game because of the injury. 

Sebastian Janikowski, K OAK - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/10/01
Janikowki needed five stitches to close a cut on his head that was suffered
during an off-field incident. He has not missed practice and should play
against the Colts this week.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/10/01
Alexander is questionable for Week Five with a back problem. Chris Thomas
will start in his place if Alexander can't play.

Tony Simmons, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Simmons was signed by the Colts. He will not play often enough to help
Fantasy owners.

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/10/01
The bye week should give Johnson sufficient time to heal from a pinched
nerve in his neck. He is expected to play in Week Six against Jacksonville.

Bert Emanuel, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Emanuel was released by the Patriots, who needed to clear roster space for
Terry Glenn. The move, however, does not necessarily mean Glenn will be
available to play in Week Five.

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/10/01
Williams (shoulder) is expected to practice on Wednesday. The stud running
back has a sprained AC joint in his shoulder, but it didn't seem to effect
him on Sunday against Minnesota. Barring a major setback, Williams will be
fine for this weekend's game against Carolina. 

Damon Washington, RB NYG - Blue Balls Updated 10/10/01
Washington suffered a sprained shoulder during Sunday's game against the
Redskins. His status is questionable for this weekend's game against St.
Louis. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/10/01
Dayne (neck) was still sore on Tuesday, so his availability for Sunday's
game against St. Louis is uncertain. An MRI revealed no serious damage, and
X-rays on his neck were negative. Head Coach Jim Fassel told the
<I>Star-Ledger</I> that he was ""fairly hopeful"" that Dayne would be ready. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/10/01
Barber (hamstring) resumed running on Tuesday, but his status for Sunday's
game against St. Louis is still uncertain. Head Coach Jim Fassel told the
<I>Star-Ledger</I> that he was ""reasonably hopeful"" that Barber would be
available, but no definitive decision has been made. 

Rickey Dudley, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/09/01
The Browns have placed Dudley on injured reserve with a foot injury,
officially ending his season. Drop him if he was on your Fantasy roster.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/09/01
Pathon is expected to miss Sunday's game because of a sprained foot. He
suffered the injury in Indianapolis' previous game against the Patriots.
Terrence Wilkins or Reggie Wayne will start in his place. 

Ty Detmer, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Detmer was benched on Monday night after another poor outing. He was
replaced by Charlie Batch and may have lost his starting QB spot. In any
event, neither signal-caller has much Fantasy value.

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/09/01
Barlow is still being hampered by a quadriceps injury, but will continue to
play despite the ailment. ""It happened, what, two months ago? And it
probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to work through it,""
Barlow told the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I>. ""People don't know how bad
this is hurting."" The injury could hamper Barlow's playing time in the
future, so be cautious when starting him Fantasy-wise. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/09/01
Stokes, who injured his knee during Sunday's win over Carolina, is listed
as probable for this weekend's contest at Atlanta. He's been inconsistent
thus far, and shouldn't be depended on to produce Fantasy-wise. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/09/01
According to Head Coach Andy Reid, Staley's shoulder injury will not cost
him the starting RB spot. However, he did say that Staley will be eased
back into the role after the team's bye week, so expect Correll Buckhalter
to see the majority of the carries when Philly plays the N.Y. Giants on
October 22. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/09/01
Franks suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's loss to Tampa Bay. The
injury isn't considered serious, however, and Franks is expected to start
this weekend against Baltimore. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Ismail (knee) will work into drills this week, which means that there is a
possibility that he will return for Monday's game against Washington. Even
if he does return, he's not worth starting for a Fantasy perspective. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Harris, who has been struggling with a groin injury, is expected to
participate in drills this week. He'll likely be available for Monday's
game against Washington, barring any setbacks. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/09/01
With Quincy Carter out for two weeks, Wright will be Dallas' starting QB
for at least next week's game. You may actually want to consider starting
Wright this week against Washington, but you'd have to be pretty desperate. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Carter is now expected to miss four-to-six weeks due to a hamstring injury.
Anthony Wright will start in Carter's place, but neither QB has much
Fantasy value at this point. 

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Baxter (hip), who was inactive for Sunday's game against Atlanta, could be
out for this weekend's game as well. The veteran tight end has very little
value as a Fantasy player at this point, so the injury won't make a huge
impact. 

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 10/09/01
Allen will remain the Bears' No. 1 tailback, at least for the moment.
Rookie Anthony Thomas will see an increase in playing time, however, so
Allen's Fantasy value will likely take a hit. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/09/01
According to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>, Thomas will not take over the
starting RB spot in Chicago, at least not yet. Head Coach Dick Jaroun will
stick with current No. 1 tailback James Allen for the time being, but
Thomas will see an increase in playing time and is worth picking up
Fantasy-wise. 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Defensive end Bruce Smith, who was knocked out of Sunday's game against the
Giants with a dislocated right shoulder, will miss two to three weeks while
the tissue in his right shoulder heals and he regains his strength and
range of motion. You shouldn't be using the Redskins' defense on a weekly
basis in a Fantasy league to begin with.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01
Johnson suffered a shoulder contusion when it was driven into the ground
during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay. He should be
fine for Week Five, but see how he fares in practice before making a
decision on starting him next week.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
The Giants said that Barber should be able to return from a hamstring
injury next Sunday in St. Louis. However, it is unclear whether he will get
the majority of the carries over Ron Dayne, so be careful starting either
unless the Giants' RB picture clears up by then.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Dayne left Sunday's game against Washington with a neck stinger, an injury
which the Giants said was not serious. He should be able to play next
Sunday in St. Louis.

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/08/01
Bradford left Sunday's game in Tampa Bay with cramps after returning a
kickoff. He will be re-evaluated on Monday.

Ryan Leaf, QB TB - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
The Cowboys remain interested in Leaf despite ligament damage in his wrist,
according to the <I>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</I>. They may sign him to the
roster and place him on injured reserve. Leaf offers no Fantasy value at
this stage of his career.

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Carter said the next 48 hours would determine whether he will be able to
play a week from Monday against Washington, according to <I>The Dallas
Morning News</I>. He has a strained left hamstring that he said he felt pop
during the first quarter of Sunday's game. Carter isn't a recommended
Fantasy starter even when healthy.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Hasselbeck (groin) missed Seattle's win over Jacksonville and watched Trent
Dilfer lead the team to 24 points. Still, Mike Holmgren claimed the injured
Hasselbeck will remain Seattle's starter. ""I said it before and I'll say it
again,"" Holmgren told the <i>Seattle Times</i>. ""Matt Hasselbeck is our
quarterback."" Hasselbeck's status for Seattle's next game is unclear.

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/08/01
Coles sprained his ankle at Buffalo. The injury is not considered to be
serious.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Glenn is eligible to start practicing, but the Patriots have applied for a
roster exemption so he can get into playing shape. Don't expect him to be a
solid contributor to the New England passing game in the near future. When
he will make his return to the lineup is still unclear.

Ray Lucas, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Lucas appeared in short-yardage sets on Sunday. He still won't play often
enough to affect Jay Fiedler's numbers.

Kevin Kasper, WR DEN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Kasper suffered a severely sprained right ankle on Sunday and will miss
three to six weeks. Travis McGriff or Chris Cole might see more time in the
passing game while Kasper is out.

Rickey Dudley, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Dudley played with a sprained foot on Sunday. He is not expected to miss
any playing time.

Patrick Johnson, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Johnson is expected to miss eight weeks with a clavicle injury. He had
already started to fall behind the emerging Travis Taylor as a preferred
target in the passing game.

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/08/01
Weinke was extremely ineffective against the Niners Sunday. He completed
only 29 of 47 passes for 275 yards. Three of his incompletions resulted in
interceptions while he threw only one touchdown pass. Weinke was effective
in the season opener but has proven to be a Fantasy reserve at best. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Walls proved to be quarterback Chris Weinke's best target Sunday against
the 49ers catching 10 passes for 91 yards and a score. Walls won't do this
every week but he will get a lot of looks from Weinke when he can't find
his receivers. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Owens was productive once again on Sunday, catching eight passes for 118
yards and two scores. Look for him to do well next week against Atlanta. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01
Hearst did not score but provided decent production Sunday against the
Panthers gaining 74 yards on 18 carries. He is not starter material at this
point but will be a good backup in most Fantasy leagues. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Garcia was solid once again in Sunday's game against the Panthers. He threw
for 212 yards and two touchdown passes against only one interception. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01
Brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance Sunday. He
only threw for 210 yards with an interception and no touchdown passes.
Brooks has struggled in the last two games but the Saints will stick with
him as the starter since they are winning games. 

Michael Vick, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01
Vick was an adequate replacement for the injured Chris Chandler but he
failed to lead the Falcons to the end zone. He completed 12 of 18 passes
for 186 yards and also gained 23 yards on four carries. Look for Vick to
return to the bench next week. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Jeffers (knees) missed Sunday's game against San Francisco. He continues to
make progress in his recovery from multiple knee surgeries, but isn't ready
to return to action just yet. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01
Barlow recently revealed that he is playing with a quadriceps injury that
has hampered his ability since training camp. ""It happened, what, two
months ago? And it probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to
work through it,"" Barlow told <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>. ""People
don't know how bad this is hurting."" Barlow will continue to play but the
injury might prevent him from taking over as the full-time running back.
Keep him on your bench for now. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Jefferson missed most of the second half of Sunday's game due to neck and
back injuries. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Receivers Terance
Mathis, Brian Finneran and Quentin McCord will be the wideouts next week if
he is inactive. 

Nick Goings, RB CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Goings was inactive for Sunday's game as Tim Biakabutuka resumed his job as
the starting running back. Keep Goings on your bench for now. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Biakabutuka started Sunday's game after being benched a week earlier. He
wasn't too effective gaining 45 yards on 10 rushes. Biakabutuka also caught
two passes for 22 yards. Keep Biakabutuka on your bench if you have depth
at running back. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01
Chandler left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury was
diagnosed as a Grade 1 concussion, the least severe on the scale. He is
listed as day to day. Michael Vick will start next Sunday if he is unable
to play. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/08/01
Stokes sprained his knee in Sunday's game, but stayed in the contest. He
will be evaluated on a daily basis. Stokes had just one catch in the game
for six yards. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Coles caught five passes for 77 yards and carried the ball two times for 15
yards at Buffalo. Coles has apparently become an important part of the New
York offense in his second pro season.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Becht caught three passes for 21 yards and a TD at Buffalo. Despite some
early struggles, Becht still appears to be an key member of the New York
passing game on third downs and near the goal line.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Price caught four passes for 103 yards and a TD against the Jets. Don't
expect big numbers from Price again in the near future. He very rarely
breaks loose for a big play. The 70-yard TD pass he caught in Week Four is
not one of his usual feats.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/07/01
Henry rushed for 113 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Against
low-quality defenses that appear on the schedule, Henry should continue to
be a good Fantasy option. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
McCardell caught seven passes for 97 yards at Seattle. The veteran wideout
looks to be in good health again, and should be a solid Fantasy starter for
the rest of the year.

Itula Mili, TE SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Mili caught two passes for 42 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. Mili is
quick, and has good hands. He is worth a look if you need help at the tight
end position.

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Alexander rushed for 176 yards on 31 carries and scored two TDs against
Jacksonville. He will continue to be a good Fantasy starter while Ricky
Watters is out, and Alexander seems to be more of a TD threat than Watters
can be right now.

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Mack was benched at Seattle on Sunday in the second quarter after rushing
for only 17 yards on eight carries. On his final attempt of the day, he
lost a fumble, and was replaced by rookie Elvis Joseph. The first-year back
rushed for only 39 yards and fumbled as well, but he caught an 18-yard TD
pass. Now there will be major questions as to who will start the next game
at RB for the Jaguars if Fred Taylor is not ready to return from a groin
injury after the bye week.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Wheatley scored two TDs against Dallas on Sunday. His rushing totals (33
yards) were modest, however, and it's still tough to start him on a weekly
basis due to the presence of Charlie Garner. 

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Brown caught seven passes for 114 yards in Oakland's win over Dallas. He
continues to be one of the more consistent receivers in the league from a
Fantasy perspective. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/07/01
Dallas tried to open up their offense against Oakland, and Galloway's
numbers improved slightly as a result. He had his best game of the season,
posting 59 yards receiving and a TD. Those are modest numbers, however, so
don't think of starting him on a weekly basis. 

Aaron Stecker, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/07/01
Stecker rushed for only six yards on two carries against Green Bay. He does
not appear to be a viable option for the Buccaneers while Warrick Dunn is
out. Tampa Bay apparently still has faith in Mike Alstott.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Smith was held in check once again, posting only 46 yards of total offense
against Oakland. Without an effective passing game, Smith is going to have
a long season. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Wright took over at QB for Dallas after Quincy Carter left in the first
quarter with a strained hamstring. He completed 14-of-22 for 126 yards and
two TDs against Oakland, but still has very little value as a Fantasy
player. 

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/07/01
Alstott rushed for 77 yards on 15 carries and a TD against the Packers. The
big fullback proved he can still be a dependable Fantasy RB.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Wycheck left Sunday's game against Baltimore with a neck strain. He did not
return to the game, and will be re-evaluated on Monday. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Freeman caught only one pass for six yards at Tampa Bay. With the emergence
of Bill Schroeder, Freeman has become the less desirable option of Green
Bay's starting wideouts.

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Gary carried the ball only nine times for 28 yards in Denver's 20-6 win
over Kansas City. He may have slipped to No. 2 on the depth chart behind
Mike Anderson. 

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Anderson posted 155 yards rushing and a score against Kansas City on
Sunday. He received much more of the workload in the Denver backfield than
Olandis Gary, and may be emerging as the team's No. 1 back. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/07/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 119 yards and a TD at Tampa Bay. The Green
Bay wideout performed well against a very tough defense, proving he has
indeed become a quality Fantasy player.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Smith had another huge outing, posting eight receptions for 110 yards and a
score against Kansas City. Smith is establishing himself as one of the best
wideouts in the league this season, and should be in your starting lineup
on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Griese struggled for the second consecutive week, posting only 121 yards
passing and a TD against Kansas City. Griese's numbers are being hurt
somewhat by the loss of Ed McCaffrey, but he still warrants a weekly
starting spot in most leagues Fantasy-wise.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/07/01
Holmes put up decent numbers against Denver, posting seven receptions and
100 yards of total offense. He's not worthy of a starting spot every week,
but he could be useful when the matchup is right. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/07/01
Green came back to earth after a solid performance last weekend against
Washington. Green was picked off four times by the Denver defense and was
held without a TD pass in the Chiefs' 20-6 loss. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/07/01
Johnson left Sunday's game vs. Green Bay for a brief period in the third
quarter with an apparent shoulder injury. He returned to the game after an
examination on the sidelines.

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/07/01
Smith rushed for 71 yards on 17 carries against the Bears. Smith lacks the
speed and burst to be a solid Fantasy RB for the rest of the year. Don't
count on him as anything more than a reserve, despite the respectable look
of his final Week Four numbers.

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/07/01
Robinson caught nine passes for 114 yards and a TD against the Falcons.
Robinson has reclaimed his spot among Fantasy Football's top wideouts now
that he is healthy again.

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Jenkins caught six passes for 119 yards and a TD against the Eagles. Don't
expect such totals from Jenkins on a regular basis. He might draw more
defensive attention in the coming weeks, and has never proved he can put up
good numbers in the past.

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Pinkston caught four passes for 90 yards and two TDs against the Cardinals.
The young wideout has quickly emerged as a quality Fantasy player because
of his good hands, concentration and leaping ability.

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
Buckhalter rushed for 134 yards on 21 carries against Arizona. The rookie
has put up fine yardage numbers in his pair of starts in place of the
injured Duce Staley.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/07/01
Plummer threw for 238 yards, two TDs and an interception in a win over
Philadelphia. His respectable performance against the Eagles' strong
defense should convince many Fantasy owners to take a chance on him as a
backup.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/07/01
Fiedler threw for only 87 yards and a TD and was intercepted once by the
Patriots. Don't depend on Fiedler for quality Fantasy numbers on a weekly
basis.

Luccis Losers Player News

Duce Staley, Reserve RB Updated 10/09/01
According to Head Coach Andy Reid, Staley's shoulder injury will not cost
him the starting RB spot. However, he did say that Staley will be eased
back into the role after the team's bye week, so expect Correll Buckhalter
to see the majority of the carries when Philly plays the N.Y. Giants on
October 22. 

Corey Bradford, Reserve WR Updated 10/08/01
Bradford left Sunday's game in Tampa Bay with cramps after returning a
kickoff. He will be re-evaluated on Monday.

Steve McNair, Injured QB Updated 10/07/01
McNair is in the starting lineup for Tennessee. His shoulder felt fine
during pregame warmups, so the decision was made by coach Steve Fisher to
start his No. 1 QB. He was unproductive, however, throwing for only 154
yards and an interception in the game. 

Mike Alstott, Active RB Updated 10/07/01
Alstott rushed for 77 yards on 15 carries and a TD against the Packers. The
big fullback proved he can still be a dependable Fantasy RB.

James McKnight, Active WR Updated 10/07/01
McKnight caught two passes for just 17 yards against the Patriots. The
veteran wideout cannot be counted on for reliable Fantasy production.

Ravens, Active DT Updated 10/07/01
Linebacker Ray Lewis (elbow) was in the starting lineup for Baltimore in
Sunday's game against Tennessee. Baltimore's defense looks spectacular
early on, and could put up some big Fantasy points against the Titans. 

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 10/05/01
Hayes is listed as probable for Sunday's game against San Francisco due to
an ankle injury. He'll likely be in the starting lineup, however, and could
put up decent numbers against the Niners. He's worth considering in larger
leagues only. 

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 10/05/01
Carter will have no problem against New Orleans cornerback Fred Thomas on
Sunday. He has a great career record against the Saints, and most
definitely should be in your active lineup this week.

Kurt Warner, Active QB Updated 10/05/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a
a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against Detroit on
Monday night, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 10/05/01
Expect Booker to get open against the weak Atlanta pass defense. He could
be worth starting as your second or third receiver in a Fantasy league.

Ike Hilliard, Reserve WR Updated 10/05/01
Hilliard will be the Giants' No. 3 receiving option this weekend against
Washington. He's still coming back from foot surgery and probably won't get
enough playing time to warrant a starting spot on your Fantasy team at this
point. 

Charlie Garner, Active RB Updated 10/02/01
Garner is nursing a slight shoulder injury. He will be listed as
questionable for Sunday's game against Dallas, but Head Coach Jon Gruden
expects him to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, Active WR Updated 09/08/01
Hakim might see a few passes thrown his way during the Rams' season opener
Sunday in Philadelphia. However, his offensive potential is limited as a
No. 3 receiving threat, so his Fantasy ceiling isn't very high.

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Crude Oil Futures Slip in Profit-Taking


    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX slipped 
$0.37 to $20.90 per barrel yesterday, but remained near 6-week highs. 
Traders attributed the losses to some profit-taking after crude 
prices climbed by $1.65 per barrel on Wednesday. Speculation that 
OPEC members will keep pumping over their quotas also pressured the 
market downward. OPEC is expected to announce its 4th production cut 
in a year today. It is expected to cut output by 1.5 million bpd 
after receiving pledges from non-member producing countries to lower 
exports by a combined total of 462,500 bpd. However, the 10 OPEC 
members with quotas exceeded their quotas by 500,000 - 600,000 bpd in 
November. Some expect that actual output reductions from OPEC and non-
members will be closer to 1.0  1.2 million bpd, which could be enough 
to prevent crude oil inventories from rising. The production cuts are 
aimed at lifting prices back into the $22 - $25 range for OPEC's 
basket of crudes. The IEA has forecast that world oil demand will 
rise next year by 600,000 bpd, about 30% below the demand growth rate 
over the last decade. Heating oil futures for January delivery on the 
NYMEX fell $0.0131 to $0.5815 per gallon. January gasoline futures on 
the NYMEX dipped $0.0086 to $0.5927 per gallon. In London, Brent 
crude oil futures for February delivery on the IPE were up $1.01 to 
$20.34 per barrel.

Canadian Oil Stocks Surge 


    Canadian oil stocks surged yesterday morning as investors 
welcomed apparent confirmation that OPEC would make its much 
predicted production cut today. The Toronto Stock Exchange oil and 
natural gas sub-index was up 1.89% at 9,047.34 just before noon. The 
jump followed Saudi Arabia's oil minister's statement that OPEC would 
announce a production cut of 1.5 million bpd. The Canadian markets 
were closed Tuesday and Wednesday for the Christmas holiday. The 
TSE's energy group topped the 9,000 level for the first time in more 
than a month. Non-OPEC exporters Russia, Mexico, Norway, Oman and 
Angola have together agreed to cut crude exports by 462,500 bpd.

Fitch Places Express Pipeline on Rating Watch Negative
  

    Fitch has placed the `A' rating of the $150 million 6.47% senior 
secured notes and the `BBB' rating of the $250 million 7.39% 
subordinated secured notes issued by Express Pipeline on Rating Watch 
Negative. The action reflects the weakened fundamentals of the US 
energy market and the resulting impact on the overall credit quality 
of the crude shippers. In addition, the financial performance of 
Express has been below original projections due to weakened demand in 
its targeted regional markets. The Express notes were issued in 
February 1998 to finance the construction of the Express Pipeline and 
to repay the costs incurred in the acquisition and upgrading of the 
Platte pipeline. The ability of Express to service its debt is 
largely dependent upon the revenues received from the pipeline 
transportation tariffs paid by various crude shippers under 
contractual off-take arrangements. Express is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Alberta Energy. The Express Pipeline System consists of 
two main segments, the Express and Platte pipelines. The Express 
segment is 785 miles long beginning in Hardisty, Alberta and running 
to Casper, WY. The Platte segment is 932 miles long beginning in 
Casper and extending to Wood River, IL.

Nigeria Under Pressure to Comply with New Quotas


   At the OPEC meeting today in Cairo, Nigeria will likely receive 
intense pressure to increase compliance with its official OPEC 
limits. The cartel is expected to finalize an agreement to cut 1.5 
million bpd from output along with almost 500,000 bpd of reductions 
from non-OPEC producers at the meeting. The cartels overall 
compliance with its self-imposed limits improved in November as the 
10 members were 600,000 bpd over their limits. However, according to 
its own data, Nigeria pumped 300,000 bpd in excess of its quota, 
making it responsible for half the cheating. If OPEC cuts output by 
an expected 1.5 million bpd, Nigeria's new quota would be about 1.79 
million bpd, necessitating a 400,000 bpd cut, or 22% from its 
November volumes. Nigeria's presidential adviser on energy will 
takeover as OPEC President on January 1st, making it even more 
important that it adhere to the quota. Some cartel members say that 
full compliance will be stressed at the meeting because they have 
asked non-members to make commitments and it is important for OPEC to 
stick to set an example. It is unlikely that OPEC members will reach 
full compliance during January. Sales commitments for the month have 
already been made and although some members like Saudi Arabia have 
flexibility in their contracts others would need to reduce volumes 
already sold.

Russia's Oil Export Plan Leaves Loopholes


    Russia's 1st quarter oil export schedule makes it only appear 
that the country will keep a promise to cut 150,000 bpd of exports in 
a bid to help OPEC lift sagging crude prices. This week, it set an 
export schedule to export 30.9 million tonnes of its own crude and 
will ship 3.63 million tonnes of Kazakh and 725,000 tonnes of Azeri 
crude in the 1st quarter of next year. Although the schedule looks 
like a firm pledge to reduce exports, there is no benchmark figure to 
which the schedule could be compared. Russian traders say that the 
country's oil firms will seek ways to increase crude exports to the 
West because it pays more than domestic consumers. They point out 
that while the export schedule includes only volumes moved by the 
state pipeline Transneft, over 2 million tonnes per quarter bypass 
Transneft. There are many ways to increase officially declared 1st 
quarter volumes, for example, by allowing oil companies to export 
cargoes not shipped in November and December due to storms. It is 
also possible that Russian oil companies will increase oil volumes to 
Ukraine and Belarus refineries, where their further shipments will be 
hard to track.

OPEC Expected to Announce Production Cut Today 

    OPEC is expected to officially announce its plan to cut up to 1.5 
million bpd from exports at a meeting in Cairo today. The output cut 
is expected to be effective as of January 1st and last 3-6 months and 
is aimed at lifting prices back into the $22 - $25 range for OPECs 
basket of crudes. But some members of the cartel appear to be bowing 
to the realization that the global economy has weakened by saying 
that they believe $20 to $22 is a reasonable level and that $25 is 
not a reasonable price. The demand for oil is growing at its slowest 
pace since 1984, forcing OPEC and non-aligned producers to cut 
supplies. The IEA predicts that oil demand will grow by just 600,000 
bpd, which is 30% lower than the average growth over the last decade. 
However, many think that OPEC will fail because of the cartels poor 
record of compliance to previously instituted reductions. OPEC 
members exceeded their quotas by 500,000 - 600,000 bpd in November. 
If OPEC does not stick to its self-imposed limits, there is very 
little incentive for producers outside the cartel to abide by their 
commitments. Some expect that actual output reductions from OPEC and 
non-members will be closer to between 1 million and 1.2 million bpd, 
which would be just about enough to keep stockpiles from rising.

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Marcus Howell: Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese 
at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?

G.G. - Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries 
this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle 
injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been 
bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer 
seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But 
remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has 
never been able to string many good performances together in 
the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be 
primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by 
Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post 
respectable numbers at Dallas.

Eric Fernau: Which three running backs should I start?  I 
have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest 
Holmes and Garrison Hearst.

G.G. - Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is 
facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but 
will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. 
Staley should have little trouble ripping through the 
Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at 
Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, 
Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.

Jay Rassat: Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have 
Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they 
play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).

G.G. - Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and 
each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. 
Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of 
a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. 
With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew 
Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New 
England QB.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not 
have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for 
people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be 
surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a 
great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a 
back like Alexander.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Latest NFL Player News

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 12/20/01
Allen is ready to assume a larger workload, says the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.
He may start against the Bengals this week. ""I expect to see more time but
I'm still not 100 percent,"" Allen said. ""My hand is going to bother me but
I need to be out there on the field to help this team.""

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/20/01
Don't expect to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime soon, Brian Billick
told the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>. ""He's my quarterback now, he's going to be
my quarterback next year, hopefully the year after that and the year after
that,"" Billick said. ""The only thing that would change that is if he
chooses to retire or God forbid, he'd get a career-ending injury."" 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Chandler won't have too look over his shoulder this week. The <i>Atlanta
Journal-Constitution</i> says Michael Vick will not see action unless
Chandler is injured. 

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Jenkins (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable
for Sunday's game. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/19/01
Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not play again this season.
Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's final three games. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/19/01
Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week.
Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be
able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Henry will miss Sunday's game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will
start in his place. 

Tim Dwight, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Dwight (fluid in lung) is not expected to play this week. He has not
produced very much this year when healthy.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 12/19/01
Wheatley, who was not used last week, is expected to see some playing time
in Week 15. He will probably not be used enough, however, to help most
Fantasy teams. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Mason missed Tuesday's practice with a hip flexor injury. His current
status is day to day.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/19/01
McNair (back stiffness) missed practice on Tuesday. His current status is
day to day. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Sanders has returned to practice from a back injury. He is not expected to
play this week. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/19/01
Richardson is day to day with a shoulder injury. He is expected to play on
Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/19/01
Gadsden missed Tuesday's practice with a strained hamstring. He is expected
to play on Saturday.

Bill Gramatica, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will
be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games of the season. 

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 12/19/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder. He
might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma?afala and gained
73 yards Sunday. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 12/19/01
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week.
Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday
against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a
groin injury. ""But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come
back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's
playing in the right games."" Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His
health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will
likely start for Bettis.

Skip Hicks, RB TEN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/18/01
Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more
work over the final three games of the season, according to the
<I>Nashville Tennessean</I>. ""We're going to play Skip more,"" Fisher said.
""We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played
[Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This
development will limit George's production over the final three weeks,
making him a risky start.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/18/01
McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back
which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is
unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he
should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next
couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 12/18/01
Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against
Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear,
but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.

Gus Frerotte, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/18/01
The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a
separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably
start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his
backup.

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Cleveland Plain Dealer</I>, Jackson could miss the
remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable
weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay
and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time
the rest of the way if Jackson is out.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/18/01
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this
week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't
reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on
the Ravens' strong rush defense.

Scott Mitchell, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's
strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether
Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth
starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.

Akili Smith, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury
Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to
reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will
probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we
don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 12/18/01
The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati
after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10
carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three
after he recovered from a hand injury. None of the three is a worthy
starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/18/01
Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie
Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not
expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale
against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs,
especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at
any time.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/18/01
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a
sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game
against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you
consider using him this week.

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/18/01
Emanuel (knee) could be back in the starting lineup this week against
Pittsburgh. He will be re-evaluated this week to determine his true status
for the game. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Moss, still suffering from a strained quadriceps is listed as questionable
for Sunday's game. The injury has sidelined him the past few weeks. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/18/01
Davis suffered a knee injury during Sunday's loss to Philadelphia. ""He's
sore today, but he has indicated he'll be fine,"" Coach Marty Schottenheimer
told the <I>Washington Post</I>. Despite the injury, Davis is expected to
start against Chicago in Week 15. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Banks will remain the Redskins'
starting quarterback. Banks has been very inconsistent recently, but Coach
Marty Schottemheimer is expected to stick with him rather than go with
backup Kent Graham. 

Frank Murphy, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Murphy suffered a severely sprained ankle during Sunday's loss to Chicago.
The injury will likely keep him out of this weekend's game against New
Orleans. 

 Buccaneers, DT TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/18/01
DT Warren Sapp (shoulder) and CB Ronde Barber (hamstring) were both injured
during Sunday's loss to Chicago. They will be limited in practice this
week, but should be available for Week 15. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/18/01
Bouman strained a ligament on the palm side of the thumb during the
Vikings' 27-24 loss Sunday at Detroit. He will be listed as probable for
Week 15, but Bouman said he isn't sure he'll be ready in time for Sunday's
game vs. Jacksonville. Third-stringer Spergon Wynn would get the start if
Bouman is unable to play. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Minneapolis Star Tribune</I>, Culpepper will have
surgery on his left knee this week, possibly as early as Wednesday. There
is an outside chance that he could play in Minnesota's season finale
against Baltimore, but that seems unlikely at this point. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/18/01
Franks suffered a mild ankle sprain during Sunday's loss to Tennessee. The
injury isn't serious, however, so Franks will be in the starting lineup in
Week 15 against Cleveland. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Foster suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Minnesota. The
extent of the injury is still unclear, so the team doesn't expect to know
his status for Week 15 until Wednesday. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/18/01
Stewart suffered a slight hip pointer during Sunday's game against
Minnesota. The injury isn't considered serious, so look for Stewart to be
in the starting lineup on Sunday against Pittsburgh. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/18/01
Walls missed practice on Monday due to an ankle injury. However, Head Coach
George Seifert expects his veteran tight end to be available for Sunday's
game against St. Louis. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Muhammad is dealing with a slight case of turf toe, which caused him to
miss practice on Monday. However, Coach George Seifert expects his veteran
wideout to start this weekend against St. Louis. 

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Jenkins suffered a sprained ankle in the second half of Saturday's game
against the N.Y. Giants. He was still very sore on Monday, so his status
for Sunday's game vs. Dallas won't be known until later in the week. 

Bill Gramatica, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
According to the <I>Arizona Republic</I>, Gramatica will miss nine months
after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament and medial meniscus cartilage
in his right knee while celebrating a 42-yard field goal on Saturday
against the New York Giants. The Cardinals will audition both Cedrick
Oglesby and Vitaly Pisetsky on Tuesday to take Gramatica's place as the
team's placekicker. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/18/01
Price's ankle is still stiff and sore. Head coach Gregg Williams will
evaluate him on a daily basis, according to published reports. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/17/01
Garcia has sprained cartilage in his ribcage, but he shouldn't miss his
next start for the San Francisco 49ers. X-rays revealed no broken bones.
Monday, coach Steve Mariucci said Garcia might miss some practice before
Saturday's game against Philadelphia, but he expects the quarterback to
play. 

Albert Connell, WR NO - Uran Man Updated 12/17/01
Connell will be officially suspended for the remainder of the season by the
team, league sources told SportsLine.com. Connell was a major
disappointment for Fantasy leaguers this year. 

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/17/01
A season-ending ankle injury to Ricky Watters makes Alexander the main man
in Seattle again. Expect him to put up good, if not spectacular numbers in
the team's final three games. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/17/01
Watters' season has ended with a broken bone in his right ankle. Seattle
coach Mike Holmgren said that an MRI test revealed the injury. Holmgren
said he will probably put Watters on injured reserve. Watters will decide
whether to have an operation on his ankle or let it heal, Holmgren said.
The injury puts Shaun Alexander back into the forefront at a crucial time
of the year for most Fantasy players. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/17/01
Franks suffered ankle and tailbone injuries on Sunday. His current status
is day to day. 

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 12/17/01
Conway injured his shin on Saturday against Oakland. His current status is
day to day.

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/17/01
George was outplayed by Skip Hicks this week, but head coach Jeff Fisher
has indicated there is no RB controversy. Hicks will continue to see some
carries at George's expense, though. 

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/17/01
Joseph suffered a bruised shoulder on Sunday. His current status is day to
day.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/17/01
Gadsden suffered a strained hamstring on Sunday. His current status is day
to day. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/17/01
Thrash bruised his ribs on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing
time. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/17/01
Pinkston has no breaks in his clavicle. He is not expected to miss any
playing time. 

Chad Lewis, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Lewis injured his groin on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/17/01
Watters will undergo an MRI on his sprained ankle. The injury is not
believed to be serious enough to keep him out of action on Dec. 23. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 12/17/01
McNabb injured his wrist on Sunday. He should be able to play in Week 15.

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/17/01
Bouman's injured right thumb will be re-examined on Monday. His status for
the upcoming game against Jacksonville is uncertain. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/17/01
X-rays on Garcia's ribs following Sunday's game revealed no damage. He is
expected to start on Saturday. 

Gus Frerotte, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/17/01
Frerotte is expected to miss the rest of the season with a separated
shoulder. Jarious Jackson will likely back up Brian Griese for the rest of
the year. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/17/01
Dillon suffered a finger injury on Sunday. He is listed as probable for
Week 15.

Akili Smith, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Smith will definitely sit out Cincinnati's Week 15 game. He injured his
hamstring against the Jets Sunday and might miss the rest of the season.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/17/01
Price injured his right ankle on Sunday. He will be evaluated on Monday. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/17/01
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says Henry will undergo X-rays to determine the
severity of his injured right knee. ""It's pretty sore right now, so I'm not
sure what's going to happen,"" Henry said. ""It's a part of football. It was
an awkward play. I got caught in the turf and the knee just went.
Hopefully, it's not too serious."" 

Bill Gramatica, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Gramatica may have a torn ACL. He was scheduled for an MRI on Monday, and
might miss the season's final three games. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/16/01
Mason caught eight passes for 107 yards and a TD against Green Bay. Right
now, he is one of Fantasy Football's best wideouts in terms of consistency. 

Skip Hicks, RB TEN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/16/01
Hicks rushed for 142 yards and a TD as the Titans used him often to give a
banged-up Eddie George some breathers. Expect to see more of Hicks from the
Titans in the final weeks of the year, although George will remain the
team's top RB option.

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/16/01
The Titans limited Freeman to 42 yards on two catches. If your team is
moving on in the playoffs, however, you can expect better numbers from
Freeman in the weeks ahead. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Green had an awful outing at Tennessee, finishing with just nine rushing
yards and 24 receiving yards. Expect him to quickly rebound from such a
poor performance. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/16/01
Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against
Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of
starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Banks? numbers were subpar against Philadelphia. He threw for 186 yards, no
touchdowns and two interceptions in the game, and isn?t reliable enough to
be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/16/01
Jackson caught four passes for 85 yards against Dallas. He continues to be
one of the most underrated and reliable receivers in the AFC. 

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 12/16/01
McNabb had a decent outing against Washington, throwing for 235 yards and
two touchdowns. He did throw three interceptions as well, but McNabb will
be a solid starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/16/01
Alexander carried seven times for 27 yards and a TD in relief of an injured
Ricky Watters on Sunday. He saw limited action until Watters went down in
the second half, and his playing time may continue to be sparse when
Watters is healthy.

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 12/16/01
Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12
carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries,
but he?s a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Carter had a horrible game on Sunday, going 14-of-33 for 135 yards with an
interception against Seattle. He has no value as a Fantasy player in any
league. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/16/01
Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this week on a
sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit
on Sunday. ""It's a small scope, not a big deal at all,"" Minnesota coach
Dennis Green said. ""Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you
never know."" Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting
out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to
doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps
on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was
officially listed as inactive. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/16/01
Smith carried nine times for only 22 yards at San Francisco. The Miami RB
has been very inconsistent in recent weeks, but he still may be good for a
few TD runs during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Todd Pinkston, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/16/01
Pinkston left Sunday's game against Washington in the fourth quarter with a
shoulder injury. He did not return to the contest, and finished with two
catches for 77 yards and a score. 

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/16/01
Fiedler threw for 149 yards, no TDs and was intercepted three times at San
Francisco. The Miami QB is too erratic to be a regular starter for any
Fantasy team during the playoffs.

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/16/01
Watters left Sunday's game against Dallas in the fourth quarter with an
injured right ankle. He was replaced by Shaun Alexander.

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 12/16/01
Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was
held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough player to start
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/16/01
Garcia left Sunday's game with sore ribs in the first half, then returned
for a short stint. However, Tim Rattay played much of the second half in
his place. Garcia finished the game with 133 yards passing and a touchdown. 

Scotty Anderson, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/16/01
Anderson caught one pass for 69 yards against Minnesota. He will catch an
occasional long ball, but Anderson is not producing enough to be useful for
most Fantasy teams right now. 

Mike McMahon, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
McMahon threw for 241 yards and rushed for 74 yards and a TD against
Minnesota. He will be a sevicable backup during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 12/16/01
The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the veteran
receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during any
week of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Really Rottens Updated 12/16/01
Bennett rushed for only 40 yards on 10 carries at Detroit. The rookie back
is too inconsistent to rely on during the Fantasy postseason. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/16/01
Price caught four passes for 67 yards against New England. He appears to be
Buffalo's most reliable Fantasy player at this time. 

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 12/16/01
The Patriots limited Van Pelt to 219 passing yards, no TDs and one
interception. Right now, the Buffalo QB is not playing well enough to start
for any Fantasy team. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/16/01
The Bills held Glenn to 27 yards on three catches. Glenn has missed too
much time this year to regularly post good numbers for New England. 

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 12/16/01
Brady had another disappointing game, throwing for 237 yards, no TDs and an
interception at Buffalo. All of a sudden, the New England QB appears to be
a Fantasy risk during the most important weeks of the year.

Dominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 12/16/01
Rhodes rushed for 177 yards and two TDs against Atlanta. The Colts are out
of the playoff hunt, yet Rhodes will keep many Fantasy teams in the running
for a title. 

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 12/16/01
Manning got back on track with 325 passing yards, three TDs and an
interception against the Colts. He remains a must-start player in all
Fantasy leagues.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/16/01
Alexander had four catches for 72 yards and a touchdown against Denver.
He's been playing better in recent weeks, but Alexander is still a risky
play outside of deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 12/16/01
Martin caught seven passes for 84 yards and a TD at Indianapolis. Don't
expect consistently good numbers from him during the Fantasy postseason.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/16/01
Holmes had another solid game, posting 121 yards rushing and a touchdown
against Denver. He's a must-start every week during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 12/16/01
Smith had a huge game against Kansas City, posting eight catches for 100
yards and a score. His injured ankles didn't seem to hamper him in the
contest, which is good news for owners depending on Smith during the
Fantasy playoffs. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Chandler threw for 249 yards, two TDs and no interceptions at Indianapolis.
If he remains healthy, Chandler will continue to be a reliable QB during
the Fantasy playoffs.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Luccis Losers Player News

Alex Van Pelt, Reserve QB Updated 12/16/01
The Patriots limited Van Pelt to 219 passing yards, no TDs and one
interception. Right now, the Buffalo QB is not playing well enough to start
for any Fantasy team. 

Charlie Garner, Active RB Updated 12/16/01
Garner had 113 scrimmage yards against San Diego on Saturday. He was held
out of the end zone for the third straight week, however, and has only
scored two touchdowns the entire season. 

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 12/16/01
The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the veteran
receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during any
week of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Kurt Warner, Active QB Updated 12/14/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success this week. Expect fine
numbers from him against the NFC West rival Saints on Monday Night
Football. 

James McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 12/14/01
McKnight has not been a reliable Fantasy receiver this year. Don't expect
much from him on the road at San Francisco.

Ike Hilliard, Reserve WR Updated 12/14/01
Expect at least one TD catch from Hilliard this week. The Giants should be
able to exploit the holes in Arizona's secondary with regular strikes to
Hilliard and Amani Toomer.

Larry Parker, Reserve WR Updated 12/10/01
Parker suffered a bruised right shoulder in Sunday's game against Oakland.
His current status is day to day.

Mike Alstott, Active RB Updated 12/09/01
Alstott rushed for 66 yards and a TD and caught four passes for 34 yards
against Detroit. The Tampa Bay fullback will be a regular scoring threat
during the Fantasy postseason.

Cameron Cleeland, Reserve TE Updated 12/09/01
Cleeland is expected to play on Sunday against Atlanta. According to the
<I>Times Picayune</I>, however, Cleeland will be the No. 3 tight end behind
Boo Williams and Lamont Hall. Cleeland will be used in certain goal-line
situations, which makes him worth considering in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 12/09/01
Booker was completely held in check on Sunday by Green Bay. He caught only
two passes for 14 yards in the game, which was easily his worst outing of
the season. 

Duce Staley, Active RB Updated 12/09/01
The Chargers held Staley to 21 rushing yards on 15 carries, but he caught
five passes for 88 yards and a TD. The Eagles will find many ways to
utilize Staley as the NFL regular season winds down.

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 12/07/01
Hayes has been too unreliable this season to warrant a starting spot in
most Fantasy leagues. The return of Muhsin Muhammad may help his numbers in
Week 13, but he's still far too risky to start. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, Reserve WR Updated 11/27/01
Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday night's 24-17
loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the game. 

Ravens, Active DT Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after
undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of
the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage
than usual. 

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Subject:  Possible Natural Gas Hoax


     With all the fear going around, I feel I should warn you of a
possible ""scare-tactic"" I have heard of that might occur on April 1 of next
year.....

     I have a friend who has a friend who dates his cousin who has a
contact at a company where a guy has a friend who knows someone who trades
natural gas basis.

     Apparently, this person went to Sullivan's in Houston the other
night and overheard a story that shivered my timbers.   He said that he
heard some well dressed guys talking in hushed tones about natural gas
prices.  He overheard that there was a rumor going around at one of the
guy's offices that a gas trader there has a friend who heard this story
from
a scheduler who knows a power trader who dates a lease crude buyer who has
a
cousin who works in accounting at a publicly traded company that does
business with a pinto bean grower in South Texas.

     Apparently, on April 1st, some strangers will be going around with
their index finger pointed out of a closed fist.  They may look like they
are pointing the finger.  They may approach you for assistance with their
finger.

     DO NOT PULL THEIR FINGER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

     This may or may not be real but I am sending it out to those I care
about.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Latest NFL Player News

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a
must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't
depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in
place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help
Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the
weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you
need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.
Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player
on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best
wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him
during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be
a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper
league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too
talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead
your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start
during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2
wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during
the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2
during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not
accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid
Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2
wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the
NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not
in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into
your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider
him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch
a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be
a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless
your team is very thin at wide receiver. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless
you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't
recommended. 

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a
reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best
during your playoffs. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his
yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD
reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your
playoffs.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be
very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Coles has been New York's best receiver this year. He will continue to be a
consistent TD threat during the Fantasy postseason. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Miller has been inconsistent this season. Starting Miller is too huge a
gamble in the Fantasy playoffs. 

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Martin will be a key player in many Fantasy championship drives. Keep him
in your lineup throughout the rest of the season. 

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Booker has been one of the better receivers in the NFC. Look for him to
produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. 

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Chambers may start this week because Oronde Gadsden will be less than 100
percent healthy with a hamstring injury. He will continue to be a regular
TD threat during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Pittman has been inconsistent as a Fantasy player. Don't rely on him too
much during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 12/21/01
Plummer has played well this season. He should be an adequate QB during the
Fantasy playoffs. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Williams (ribs) is now listed as probable. He has been practicing with no
apparent problems. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
According to the <i>Pro Football News and Injury Report</i>, Davis' status
for Sunday's game is questionable right now. He has told reporters he will
play, but Ki-Jana Carter will start in his place if Davis can't play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hakim has a sore back. He is expected to play against Carolina. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Faulk has a minor knee problem. He is listed as probable for this week's
game. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Bruce (foot) missed Thursday's practice. He is listed as probable for this
week. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Owens (hip) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Garcia (ribs) returned to practice on Thursday. ""We didn't do too much with
him but just enough to make him feel somewhat confident about making
progress this week. The important thing will be how he feels tomorrow, does
he become real sore,"" Steve Mariucci told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""I
didn't notice any wincing. I didn't see any grimacing. I saw him throw a
couple of frozen ropes."" Garcia is expected to play this week. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Bouman worked on a limited basis in practice on Thursday. There is a chance
Spergon Wynn may start in his place this week, and that decision may be
made on Friday. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Parker may miss this week's game with a shoulder injury. He has not been a
reliable Fantasy player this year when healthy. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Holmes returned to practice on Thursday. He should assume his regular
workload this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Franks (ankle) has returned to practice. He is expected to play on Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Gadsden (hamstring) has returned to practice, but Chris Chambers may start
over him this week. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Muhammad (toe) did not practice on Thursday. He might miss the game against
Buffalo, and Isaac Byrd will start in his place if Muhammad can't play. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Walls (ankle) practiced on Thursday. He might be able to play against
Buffalo. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Price (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Wycheck started off slow this season but has been productive in recent
weeks. Expect him to contribute a fair amount of points during the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Christian missed practice with tightness in his calf on Thursday. His
current status is day to day. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
George is listed as questionable for Saturday's game because of an ankle
injury, but is expected to play. Look for him to be productive this week
against a weak Raider run defense. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Look for Dyson to be a decent No. 2 receiver during the Fantasy postseason.
He might not score, but he should catch a few passes. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Mason is expected to play Saturday, despite suffering from a hip injury.
Look for him to be an adequate No. 2 wideout. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Ward hasn't scored a lot of touchdowns this season but is among the league
leaders in receptions. He should be an asset to your team for the rest of
the season as a No. 2 wideout. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Burress has been more reliable in recent weeks but still remains a risky
pick for the Fantasy playoffs. He will only be a good No. 2 wideout at
best. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect
him to be too productive during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Mack has produced an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't
scored a lot. He should be used in larger leagues only for the remaining
weeks. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
McCardell has caught a lot of passes this season but he doesn't score too
many touchdowns. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 receiver in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith has been one of the best receivers in the AFC this season, despite
his offseason injury. The veteran is a must-start for your Fantasy playoff
run. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Couch has been inconsistent this season. He is far too unreliable to be
considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has been solid all season. Look for him to be a good receiver
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Grbac has been inconsistent at times this season but should still be an
adequate starter during the Fantasy playoffs. Expect him throw for at least
200 yards and a touchdown. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Ismail has been a reliable receiver all season. Look for this trend to
continue throughout the Fantasy playoffs. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Taylor is not expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a groin
injury that has sidelined him for most of the season. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Dillon missed practice Thursday because of a finger injury but <i>The
Cincinnati Post</i> reports that he is expected to play Sunday. Even if
healthy, Dillon is a risky start this week against a tough Baltimore run
defense. Consider benching him if you have a backup of equal value. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Kitna, still recovering from a finger injury, is not at full strength. He
will start Sunday but has not been productive enough to use in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Scott Covington, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
The Bengals have signed Covington to their roster. Covington will backup
Jon Kitna this week. However, Covington is not worth using even if he
receives playing time. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Brunell is expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a quadriceps
injury that has limited his abilities over the past month. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
McNair missed practice Thursday for the third straight day because of back
spasms and is questionable for the game against Oakland. McNair first
experienced some stiffness in his lower back late last week. In the first
quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles tightened
up. However, he stayed in the game. Even McNair is unsure of his status for
Saturday night. ""If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it,""
he said. ""I'm very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time
the spasms have stayed longer than I anticipated."" Avoid using McNair this
week if you have a backup of equal value. His health status makes him a
major risk. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
The Cleveland Browns put Jackson on injured reserve on Thursday. Jackson,
who leads the team with 554 yards rushing, will miss the rest of the season
with an ankle injury. He aggravated a left ankle sprain in the first
quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and left the
game with two carries for six yards. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White will
share carries in his absence, but neither are reliable players to use
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Sharpe (leg) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Drew Brees, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/20/01
There still seems to be a chance Brees might play this week or before the
season ends, says the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i>. He has been taking
snaps with the first team in practice. ""I'm not going to say that he will
play, (but) could he play? Yes,"" Mike Riley. ""But I'm not going to say he
will for sure. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the
Niners' goal-line back, says the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""It's a
coincidence,"" Barlow said. ""It was my turn in the rotation to be in there.""
The two backs will continue to split carries. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Owens (hip) did not practice on Wednesday. He is still expected to play
this week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/20/01
Garcia (ribs) has been downgraded to questionable, but he still expects to
play this week. Tim Rattay took snaps with the first team on Wednesday. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
The <I>New York Daily News</i> says the pain in Hilliard's toe has
worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play
against Seattle. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Moss (quadriceps) has returned to practice. He might be able to play this
week.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/20/01
McNair has missed some practice time this week because of a back injury. He
is still expected to start. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Bouman (thumb) missed practice on Wednesday. He is expected to play this
week, although the <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i> says he might have to
throw in pain. ""We think he'll be practicing full speed on Thursday and
Friday,"" Dennis Green said. ""I think he'll get accustomed to how he's got
to throw the ball and I think he will be effective.""

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Wilkins will sit out again this week with a hamstring injury. Reggie Wayne
will be the No. 2 receiver against the Jets. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
McKnight is listed as probable for this week's game with a back injury. He
is expected to play against New England. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Foster (thigh) might not be able to play this week. Bert Emanuel may take
his place as Detroit's No. 2 receiver. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Stewart (hip) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/20/01
Emanuel returned to practice on Wednesday. If his knee shows no sign of
swelling, he should play this week, says the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>. 

Aaron Shea, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Shea did not participate in team drills on Wednesday. He is not expected to
play this week, and O.J. Santiago will start in his place. 

Scott Mitchell, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Mitchell strained his right rib cage on Wednesday. He is doubtful for
Sunday's game, and now Kevin Thompson will back up Jon Kitna, who is
expected to start although he still has a finger injury. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Walls (ankle) particpated in some drills on Wednesday. He is listed as
questionable, and Kris Mangum will start in Walls' place if he cannot play. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Muhammad (turf toe) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as
questionable and Isaac Byrd will start if Muhammad can't play. 

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 12/20/01
Allen is ready to assume a larger workload, says the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.
He may start against the Bengals this week. ""I expect to see more time but
I'm still not 100 percent,"" Allen said. ""My hand is going to bother me but
I need to be out there on the field to help this team.""

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/20/01
Don't expect to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime soon, Brian Billick
told the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>. ""He's my quarterback now, he's going to be
my quarterback next year, hopefully the year after that and the year after
that,"" Billick said. ""The only thing that would change that is if he
chooses to retire or God forbid, he'd get a career-ending injury."" 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Chandler won't have too look over his shoulder this week. The <i>Atlanta
Journal-Constitution</i> says Michael Vick will not see action unless
Chandler is injured. 

MarTay Jenkins, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Jenkins (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable
for Sunday's game. 

Ricky Watters, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/19/01
Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not play again this season.
Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's final three games. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 12/19/01
Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week.
Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB. 

Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be
able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/19/01
Henry will miss Sunday's game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will
start in his place.

They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.

"RE: CIG's Raton Basin 2002 Expansion Project","Plain vanilla intervention is fine.

Subject:	CIG's Raton Basin 2002 Expansion Project

Hello Paul and Mark.  FYI:  CIG proposes to construct and operate facilities necessary to transport additional volumes of approximately 55 MDth per day of natural gas out of the Raton Basin Area in Colorado and New Mexico.  

The total cost of the project is $26,896,800  with a proposed rolled-in treatment for the expansion out of the Raton Basin Area.

Question - Do you all have any issues that you want us to address in regards to the expansion or will a plain vanilla intervention be fine?  The intervention is due Nov. 5th.

If you could get to me between now and the early part of next week, that would be great.

Melinda

"hey you!!","Hey You!!!
 
I don't usually do the e-mail thing but I am tonight....
 
Listen I felt a little strange talking with you the other
day....you seemed a bit stoic or maybe a bit too business
like.....Is everything ok with you??  I realize you are very 
busy right now after coming back from a lot of time off....
But it did feel strange......
 
I just want you to know that I did not call to get together
with you I just called to see how you where doing....I seems
to me that you felt obligated to tell me that we would get
together sometime.....Don't do that.....Really I just need 
a friend sometimes to chat with....I realize I can be quite 
hard to get along with and not real appealing at those times..
 
So I guess my bottom line is that I think you are a great person
inside and you are a blast to be with.....It would be great to
get together with you just to have some fun....but please
don't feel obligated ..........
 
Anyway, I am not sure if I got my point across or not but
it would be nice to hear from you...
 
Always........

See Ya
Have a Great Day!!!!

"Enron Travel Park Training 10/16","Hi Team!

You are all invited to sit in on the Enron Travel Park training.  Details are below:

DATE:		Tuesday, October 16th
TIME:		11am to approximately 1:30pm
TOPIC:		How to use Enron's travel system on-line and via phone
HOSTS:	Tracy Ramsey (Enron) and Zou Cherry (Travel Agency in the Park)


If you plan to attend, please respond back to this note ASAP for a few reasons:

1.  We will be bringing in lunch and I need to know how many to order

2.  I will need to get you set up in their system prior to Tuesday

3.  I will need to ensure we are set with laptops and other training materials

To give you an idea about the kind of savings you can get by using this Enron feature, here's an example.  I booked a roundtrip flight from Denver>St. Louis which came up as $161, but with the Enron discount, I am paying $119.  As a comparison, on the United website, the same exact trip came in at $302.

Thank you,
Kristen

Hello,

I thought I'd write and see how you are doing?  How is the move going?  I'm still working on sending additional pictures.  We had our company Christmas party last weekend and I thought pictures would be taken.  They weren't so I'll have to come up with another plan.

The snow has been falling in the mountains here lately, and the skiing is turning out to be quite good.  Do you ski?  I've only been up a couple of times this year but I'd like to go more.  I think I may try and go here towards the end of this week.

How's the weather in AZ?  I bet it's great this time of year.  

I wanted to get back in touch, so write back when you get a chance.  


Paul

Latest NFL Player News

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/23/01
Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to
a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put
him on reserve this week. 

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 11/23/01
With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against
Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would
be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/23/01
According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for
Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and
will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen. 

Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 11/23/01
Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on
nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half. 

Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list
Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught
just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/23/01
Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game
early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games
with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/23/01
Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a
fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half,
replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't
plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next
week's game is uncertain. 

Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned
to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at
Philadelphia. He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his
postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10
victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback. 

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/23/01
Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained
ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith
might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week. 

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/23/01
Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games
because of a torn meniscus.

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/23/01
Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game.
He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the
primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against
the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch
a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis'
output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him
every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent
Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats
and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been
very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is
still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a
weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use
him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use
their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander,
and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield
in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your
active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.
Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the
run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has
been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the
wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you
should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has
only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect
another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season.
He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we
recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you
use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you
consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the
season.

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep
leagues.

Travis Minor, RB MIA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the
defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills
have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While
he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every
week.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the
end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but
you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running
back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'
secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He
might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and
there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas
City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep
league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your
lineup.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday,
which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We
recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against
the Jets in Week Nine.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should
rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against
this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less
mistake-prone quarterback.

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Alexander will be back in the
starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent
prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a
gamble. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't
recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this
is the game he will break his slump.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some
trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia
secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore,
and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at
quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat
Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for
explosive stats.

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to
keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less
impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes
than most receivers in the league.

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing
the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this
week if you have no other options at running back.

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance
Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight
end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However,
you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday
against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way
and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend
you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent.
However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer
downfield for great stats this week.

Dominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should
definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats,
but should give good rushing totals and a score.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in
recent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game
Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend
these two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be
Clark.

Dwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Carswell might factor into the Broncos' passing game more Thursday against
Dallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver. However, he had no catches in
similar circumstances in Week 10, and the Cowboys will be ready to defend
short passes to him. Only use Carswell if you're thin at the tight end
position.

Keith Poole, WR DEN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
If Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday's game against Dallas, Poole will need
to step up as the Broncos' top receiving target. However, we don't
recommend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a
reliable point-producer. Keep Poole reserved against Dallas.

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Don't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. he has been inconsistent
this season, and may not do much against a physical Pittsburgh defense.

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Mason should post respectable statistics against the Steelers. Don't expect
him to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense.

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Alstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't
expect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,
scoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. 

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Johnson threw for 399 yards last week against Chicago, but he also threw no
touchdowns and was picked off twice. He's been unreliable from a Fantasy
standpoint, and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Johnson had a big game against Chicago last weekend, catching 12 passes for
89 yards. He was held out of the end zone again, but look for that to
change on Monday night against St. Louis. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New
England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,
so avoid starting him if at all possible. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Holt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend against
New England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and is
worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Bruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven
catches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against
a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. 

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gary will likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas, but
we don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats. The Cowboys will
probably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky
starts this week since they have been splitting time.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
With favorite target Rod Smith likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have
questionable receivers to work with Thursday against Dallas. However, the
Cowboys' defense will probably focus on the run and force Griese to beat
them through the air. He should provide your team with decent stats and is
worth using this week.

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Faulk had 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against New England last
weekend. He's the best player in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in
any league format. 

Jamel White, RB CLE - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
The Browns may use White as a change-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar
Bengals run defense. You might want to consider him as a third running back
option on your team if you're lacking in starting options.

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, and is now listed as questionable for
Monday's game against Tampa Bay due to a shoulder injury. With the lack of
depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is
something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do if he's
healthy. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401
yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and
will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent
secondary. 

O.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Santiago catches the occasional pass for the Browns and could find the end
zone every now or then. He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati
secondary, so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores. Only use
Santiago if you're desperate for a tight end, however, as he rarely gets a
big yardage total.

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Johnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game
this season, and is now a very reliable No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver.
Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the
Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get him into your lineup.

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Couch has a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards,
four TDs), whom he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks
you could choose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week,
give him a look.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Warrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't
provided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league.
His matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him
reserved this week.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Although Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games
against the Browns, whom he plays Sunday, we can't recommend you use him
this week. He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from
a Fantasy perspective.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
We can't advise you use Kitna as he goes up against the Browns' secondary
this week. Cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year,
leading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the
Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678
rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in
your active lineup week in and week out in any league.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Centers has been a great pass-catching back for the Bills this season, but
he will face a Miami defense on Sunday that will likely be able to contain
him. Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks,
logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a bigger
challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reserving him.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
There's a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week
against a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent
limited role in the Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he
has a good history against the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and
he might be worth using as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.

Eric Johnson, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina.
Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth
starting at this point. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Stokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for 72 yards
and two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable overall,
however, so starting him is still a risky move. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Henry had a very disappointing game against the Seahawks in Week 10, and
will likely struggle again against the far-better Dolphins defense on
Sunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit using this week.

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a
strong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar
Seahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this
week despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the
bench for Week 11.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
After a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self.
We don't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so
don't use him this week.

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Sharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving
touchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced
Jacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe
into your active lineup every week.

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly
developing into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot
streak and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you
get Ismail into your starting lineup this week.

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Buckhalter will return from suspension this weekend, and will be available
for Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Staley has established himself
as the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhalter is a gamble. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Staley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in
Philadelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes
him worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Just when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two catches for 17 yards
like he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will still be in the
starting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gamble nonetheless. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Barber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a
touchdown in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run
this season, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their
offense in Week 11. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Toomer caught five balls for 60 yards against Minnesota on Monday night,
but he'll struggle to post similar numbers vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a
formidable secondary, so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a
wise move. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Collins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321
yards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into
the end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a
result, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Jackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does
have the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a
deeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Horn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing
through them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two
touchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against
New England based on his potential to post huge numbers. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Bennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the
NFL style of game. He's been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely
worth a roster spot at this point. He'll do nothing against Chicago's
aggressive run defense, so don't bother starting him. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Culpepper finally had a breakout game last week, connecting on four
touchdown passes against the N.Y. Giants. He should have success against
Chicago's secondary on Sunday, so be sure to include him when you choose
your Week 11 starting lineup. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
The Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament
in his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery
in the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him
awaiting his return.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Glenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the pre-practice
walkthrough on Wednesday, according to published reports. He is unlikely to
play Sunday against New Orleans and shouldn't be on anyone's Fantasy roster
at this point.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Chamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the N.Y.
Giants, but he's expected to play this weekend vs. Chicago. Chamberlain has
been unreliable of late, and getting open against Chicago's tough
linebacking group won't be an easy task. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157
yards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same
Lions, whose defense is questionable at best. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Favre had a somewhat rough outing last weekend, throwing three
interceptions against Atlanta. However, he's still one of the best Fantasy
quarterbacks in the league, and he should bounce back on Thanksgiving
against Detroit. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Freeman has been solid of late, catching four touchdown passes in his last
five games. He's a must start against Detroit's vulnerable pass defense in
Week 11. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Franks has cooled off considerably in recent weeks, but his potential to
find the end zone still makes him a good Fantasy player. Unless you have a
better option, starting Franks is advisable. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend
against Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in
the league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Batch had a huge game against Arizona last weekend, but he's been
inconsistent this season for the most part. He's better off used when the
matchup is right, so facing a tough Green Bay defense may not bode well for
his Fantasy numbers.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Morton had a big game against Arizona last weekend, and has been a
surprisingly reliable Fantasy player this season. He may struggle against
Green Bay's tough pass defense, but he's still worth taking a gamble on in
Week 11. 

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Howard is not expected to miss an extended period of time due to his
shoulder injury. He hasn't practitced this week, however, and is listed as
doubtful for Thursday's game against Green Bay. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Emanuel, who suffered a sprained left knee during last weekend's game
against Arizona, will miss at least four weeks of action. There was a
chance that he'd be out for the season, but now he's expected to return in
mid-to-late December. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Stewart (ankle) practiced on Tuesday and feels as though he's ready to
return to action. ""I feel pretty good,"" Stewart told the <I>Detroit Free
Press</I>. ""It felt better than I thought. I'm just going to see, let (the
medical staff and coach Marty Mornhinweg) decide whether I play or not.""
His carries may be down a bit in his first game back, but he's worth
starting in deeper leagues, barring any setbacks.

Paul,
Have you heard anything from Gerald about the contracts?  The deal is almost

Crude Oil Futures Slide Despite OPEC Cut


    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX lost $0.49 
to $20.41 per barrel on Friday, despite OPEC's official announcement 
of a 1.5 million bpd cut in production after other producers agreed 
to slice 462,500 bpd from their combined output. Crude oil prices 
rose to $21.38 per barrel but then slumped after OPEC's president 
said the cartel would be happy with anything above $20 per barrel for 
Brent crude. However many doubt not only the cartels ability, but the 
strength of commitment by non-members to stick to their lower 
production quotas. The OPEC countries with quotas pumped 600,000 over 
their limits in November. But Nigeria was responsible for half of the 
cheating, producing 300,000 barrels over its quota. Nigeria's OPEC 
representative is slated to become the cartel's new president on 
January 1st, effectively putting pressure on the country to adhere to 
its limits. Some positive news for the market was found as consumer 
confidence posted its biggest gain in almost 4 years, home sales 
climbed and unemployment rates stabilized. Heating oil futures for 
January delivery on the NYMEX declined $0.0015 to $0.5665 per gallon. 
January gasoline futures on the NYMEX fell $0.0071 to $0.5856 per 
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for February delivery on 
the IPE were down $0.04 to $20.30 per barrel.

Refining Margins Forecast to Shrink in 2002

    Oil refiners around the world will likely experience shrinking 
profit margins in 2002 as a global economic slump has sharply lowered 
demand. The US, Asia and Northwest Europe all have a hefty oversupply 
of oil inventories. Refinery runs can be expected to stay 10% - 50% 
below capacity in Asia. Although the percentage may not be as quite 
as dismal in Europe and the many still expect lower refinery profits 
for early 2002 and possibly for most of the year on both continents. 
Asia's margins were mostly negative this year while US margins hit $6-
$9 per barrel early in 2001 but fell to $3 - $4 per barrel later in 
the year. European margins were mostly unchanged at an average of 
about $2.00 per barrel. In Northwest Europe, refiners' profits depend 
on how US gasoline prices fare, as a large portion of Europe's 
surplus gasoline is exported across the Atlantic. Northwest European 
refiners have cut up to 20% of runs in the last month. On average for 
2001, margins for Northwest Europe refineries running Brent crude are 
estimated to be less than $2.00 per barrel, below the $3.00 average 
for 2000, but well above the $1.20 per barrel Northwest European 
margins of 1999.

Oilfield Services Most Volatile Stocks in Energy Sector
  
    Oilfield service stocks, which often climb or fall by 5% or more 
one day, then swing in the other direction the next day, are the most 
volatile group within the energy sector. Energy stocks are among the 
most unpredictable in the US stock market, shifting along with oil 
and natural gas prices that can soar or sink with a sudden change in 
the weather. In the category of energy stocks, oilfield services can 
be the most unstable because their earnings are tied to the ups and 
downs of drilling activity. When companies lower their drilling 
activity, equipment and service companies do not get hired but still 
have many fixed costs. The upstream oil and natural gas exploration 
and production business is the next most volatile sector of the 
energy industry, with integrated oil companies being the most stable 
because their refining and marketing operations can counteract their 
upstream business. In 1998 oil prices dropped from $17.60 to about 
$12 and the Philadelphia stock exchange's oil service index fell 55% 
while the S&P oil and gas exploration and production index tumbled 
39%. The S&P index of integrated oil companies climbed 6% that year. 
The next year, oil prices rebounded to $25.60 per barrel and oil 
service stocks jumped by 67%, the upstream sector rose 17% and 
integrated oils increased 15%. Last year, contrary to the law of 
averages, natural gas prices sky-rocketed to $9.80 per Mcf and 
upstream endeavors gained 57% while oil services rose 45% and 
integrated oils climbed 6%. In a stock rating system, values above 1 
indicate greater risk for volatility, values below 1 show lower than 
average volatility. Several oil field service companies have ratings 
as high as 1.7, while ExxonMobil is rated 0.4. Some analysts say that 
investors could see a potential upside next year by moving away from 
the relative safety of the major integrated oil companies towards 
more volatile energy stocks.

Judge Recuses Himself in Unocal Patent Case

Unocal has said that a US District Court Judge recused himself from 
the case involving infringement on the its '393 gasoline patent due 
to his discovery that he had a financial interest in one of the 
parties involved. The case will be returned for reassignment. In 
October, the judge granted the company's motion for summary judgment 
requesting an accounting of infringement of its '393 cleaner burning 
gasoline patent by 5 refiners. However, a written judgment had not 
been issued. Further proceedings in the case will now be considered 
by the new judge. The defendants in the case are Atlantic Richfield, 
Chevron, Texaco, Exxon, Mobil and Shell. In 1997, a jury found the 
Unocal patent valid and that the defendants had infringed upon it in 
their refining processes. The jury awarded damages of $0.0575 per 
infringing gallon. Unocal received a payment of $69 million plus 
accrued interest and some attorneys' fees in June 2000 for 
infringement from March through July, 1996. About 29% of the RFG 
gasoline manufactured by the defendants during that period infringed 
on the '393 patent. The jury decision was upheld by an Appeals Court 
in May 2000. In February of 2001, the Supreme Court declined to hear 
the case. License agreements have been signed with 8 companies for 
the 5 patents that Unocal holds for cleaner burning gasoline 
compositions. Earlier this year, Unocal introduced a uniform 
licensing program that specifies a range of between $0.12 and $0.34 
per gallon for volumes that fall under the Unocal patents. The rate 
per gallon is reduced as more utilization occurs.

ExxonMobil May Withdraw Bid for China Pipeline Project

    ExxonMobil is considering pulling out of talks to build a $5 
billion natural gas pipeline in China. The withdrawal would leave 
Royal Dutch/Shell Group as the only major foreign oil company taking 
part in the project and may affect its funding. The 4,000-kilometer 
pipeline, China's longest, is part of a $14 billion plan to transport 
reserves in the northwestern province of Xinjiang to Shanghai.

Judge Recuses Himself in Unocal Patent Case

Unocal has said that a US District Court Judge recused himself from 
the case involving infringement on the its '393 gasoline patent due 
to his discovery that he had a financial interest in one of the 
parties involved. The case will be returned for reassignment. In 
October, the judge granted the company's motion for summary judgment 
requesting an accounting of infringement of its '393 cleaner burning 
gasoline patent by 5 refiners. However, a written judgment had not 
been issued. Further proceedings in the case will now be considered 
by the new judge. The defendants in the case are Atlantic Richfield, 
Chevron, Texaco, Exxon, Mobil and Shell. In 1997, a jury found the 
Unocal patent valid and that the defendants had infringed upon it in 
their refining processes. The jury awarded damages of $0.0575 per 
infringing gallon. Unocal received a payment of $69 million plus 
accrued interest and some attorneys' fees in June 2000 for 
infringement from March through July, 1996. About 29% of the RFG 
gasoline manufactured by the defendants during that period infringed 
on the '393 patent. The jury decision was upheld by an Appeals Court 
in May 2000. In February of 2001, the Supreme Court declined to hear 
the case. License agreements have been signed with 8 companies for 
the 5 patents that Unocal holds for cleaner burning gasoline 
compositions. Earlier this year, Unocal introduced a uniform 
licensing program that specifies a range of between $0.12 and $0.34 
per gallon for volumes that fall under the Unocal patents. The rate 
per gallon is reduced as more utilization occurs.

Oilfield Services Most Volatile Stocks in Energy Sector
  
    Oilfield service stocks, which often climb or fall by 5% or more 
one day, then swing in the other direction the next day, are the most 
volatile group within the energy sector. Energy stocks are among the 
most unpredictable in the US stock market, shifting along with oil 
and natural gas prices that can soar or sink with a sudden change in 
the weather. In the category of energy stocks, oilfield services can 
be the most unstable because their earnings are tied to the ups and 
downs of drilling activity. When companies lower their drilling 
activity, equipment and service companies do not get hired but still 
have many fixed costs. The upstream oil and natural gas exploration 
and production business is the next most volatile sector of the 
energy industry, with integrated oil companies being the most stable 
because their refining and marketing operations can counteract their 
upstream business. In 1998 oil prices dropped from $17.60 to about 
$12 and the Philadelphia stock exchange's oil service index fell 55% 
while the S&P oil and gas exploration and production index tumbled 
39%. The S&P index of integrated oil companies climbed 6% that year. 
The next year, oil prices rebounded to $25.60 per barrel and oil 
service stocks jumped by 67%, the upstream sector rose 17% and 
integrated oils increased 15%. Last year, contrary to the law of 
averages, natural gas prices sky-rocketed to $9.80 per Mcf and 
upstream endeavors gained 57% while oil services rose 45% and 
integrated oils climbed 6%. In a stock rating system, values above 1 
indicate greater risk for volatility, values below 1 show lower than 
average volatility. Several oil field service companies have ratings 
as high as 1.7, while ExxonMobil is rated 0.4. Some analysts say that 
investors could see a potential upside next year by moving away from 
the relative safety of the major integrated oil companies towards 
more volatile energy stocks.

Latest NFL Player News

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Trent Dilfer will start at quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks for one
more week while Hasselbeck recovers from a groin injury, coach Mike
Holmgren said Thursday. Hasselbeck, who has a pulled left groin, practiced
Wednesday, but sat out Thursday's practice. 

Reidel Anthony, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Anthony practiced Wednesday despite a left shoulder contusion, and he is
expected to play Sunday at Tennessee. However, he hasn't been a main
receiving threat for the Bucs this season, so don't use him in a Fantasy
league.

Dave Moore, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Moore missed Wednesday's practice with a right ankle sprain, but is
expected to play in Sunday's game at Tennessee. He hasn't proven a reliable
Fantasy tight end thus far, so don't use him this week.

Jacquez Green, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/11/01
Green did not practice Wednesday due to an injured left groin, but he is
expected to play Sunday in Tennessee. We don't recommend you use him
against the tough Titans secondary this week.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/11/01
Dunn participated in light running drills Wednesday and could practice
Thursday or Friday, according to the <I>St. Petersburg Times</I>. Provided
he has no problems with his sprained right foot, Dunn could play Sunday in
Tennessee. We don't recommend you take your chances, and instead only use
Dunn this week if he is clearly going to get the majority of the carries at
running back.

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/11/01
According to the <I>Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel</I>, talk out of Packers
practice is that Freeman will get more passes thrown his way in the next
few games. We're not convinced Brett Favre will stop throwing the majority
of his passes to Bill Schroeder as long as Schroeder remains productive,
but there's a good chance Freeman might yet be able to help Fantasy teams
this season. Just don't start him against the stifling Ravens defense this
week.

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Jefferson is dealing with both neck and back injuries, but he has returned
to practice this week. He lacks the consistency to help Fantasy leaguers on
a regular basis, so avoid starting him if possible. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/11/01
Chandler, who suffered a mild concussion last week, is expected to start
this week for the Falcons. Michael Vick, however, still might appear in
some short-yardage packages.

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Jeffers might finally return to the Carolina lineup this week. He is close
to full speed, says the <i>Charlotte Observer</i>. ""He's still working his
way into being ready,"" Seifert said. ""He's starting to capture my
imagination.""

Marcus Robinson, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/11/01
Robinson participated sparingly in practice because his surgically-repaired
back remains sore from playing on artificial turf last Sunday, according to
the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>. He isn't on the Bears' injury report, and we
think he'll have a solid Fantasy week. Feel free to use Robinson if he
doesn't suffer a setback.

Shane Matthews, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
The Bears listed Matthews as questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona
with a rib injury. He will serve as the No. 3 quarterback at best, so don't
use him as a Fantasy starter right now.

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Baxter is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona with a
hip injury. He's a questionable Fantasy player to begin with.

Damon Washington, RB NYG - Blue Balls Updated 10/11/01
Washington (shoulder sprain) practiced on Wednesday. As of now, it looks
like he might be asked to start at halfback against the Rams.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01
Dayne (neck) did not practice on Wednesday. Right now, it does not appear
that he will play against St. Louis.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Barber did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for
Sunday, and as of now, it does not appear he will play against the Rams.

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01
Sanders did not practice on Wednesday because of a quadriceps injury. His
current status is day to day.

Robert Thomas, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Thomas suffered a lacerated finger during practice on Wednesday. However,
the Dallas fullback is probable for Monday's game against Washington.
Thomas has no real value as a Fantasy player. 

 Saints, DT NO - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Defensive end Joe Johnson could miss Sunday's game against Carolina with a
strained left quadriceps. He'll be listed as doubtful, but there is an
outside chance that he'll play. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the
Panthers this week, which makes them worth starting as a defense
Fantasy-wise. 

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01
Hasselbeck (groin) has started taking the snaps with the first-team offense
and is listed as probable on the Seahawks' injury report. Although no
official decision has been announced, a healthy Hasselbeck would likely get
the start over Trent Dilfer this week.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/11/01
Davis returned to practice and worked with the scout team. He is making
cuts without pain, and there is a chance he could return in early November.
""I'm not going to put a target date on it,"" Davis told the <i>Denver
Post</i>. ""I'm just going to go through this week, evaluate it and see
where I am at the end of this week, and we'll go from there. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
The <i>Kansas City Star</i> says the Chiefs are preparing to play Sunday's
game without Alexander, who still has a back problem. ""It's not
structurally damaged from a nerve standpoint, but they can definitely see
why there is some soreness from the MRIs,"" Dick Vermeil said. ""He's just
got to work through it."" Chris Thomas will probably start in Alexander's
place.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/11/01
Wayne might be asked to make his first pro start this week. Jerome Pathon
is expected to sit out with a foot injury, and Terrence Wilkins is
questionable with a rib problem. Newly-signed Tony Simmons might work as
the third receiver.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Wilkins is questionable for Sunday's game against Oakland with a rib
injury. Jerome Pathon (foot) might also sit out, leaving Indianapolis thin
at wideout against the Raiders.

Mike Vanderjagt, K IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Vanderjagt has not kicked since having a toenail removed last week. But he
is expected to play against the Raiders on Sunday night.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Glenn has returned to practice. The Patriots are not sure when he will be
ready to play, but might have a good indication of his progress by the
weekend.

John Hall, K NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Hall left practice with a back injury. His current status is day to day,
although there are no plans for an MRI.

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Mason worked out in the beginning of practice Wednesday but his ankle was
so sore that he had to stop. He is listed as questionable for this week's
game. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/11/01
George did some light running, but did not practice Wednesday. ""Eddie was
better by the end of practice. He is still sore,"" head coach Jeff Fisher
told <i>The Tennessean</i>. ""He is doing more than what I thought he would
do considering where he was after the game."" Fisher also added that George
would be a game-time decision if he doesn't practice on Thursday or Friday.
The Titans will use Skip Hicks and Mike Green in his place if George is
inactive. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/11/01
Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice to allow a minor knee injury to heal.
He is expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Ward was held out of practice Wednesday to let a toe injury heal. He is
expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01
The Jaguars have ruled Taylor out for their next game against Buffalo on
October 18. Taylor is still recovering from the groin injury he suffered in
Week Two. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01
Warrick is suffering from a leg injury and did not practice Wednesday.
However he is listed as probable for this week's game and might resume
practicing on Thursday. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Heap's condition is more doubtful than questionable for Sunday's game,
according to <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>. Heap is still recovering from an
ankle injury and missed practice for the second consecutive day Wednesday.
Shannon Sharpe will get most of the looks at tight end if Heap is inactive. 

R.Jay Soward, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
The Jaguars got official notice Wednesday that Soward will be out another
six weeks because of a suspension. Soward, the team's first-round draft
pick in 2000, missed the first four games for his first violation. He could
have returned this week, but now won't be eligible to return until Nov. 26
-- if the Jaguars want him back at all. ""He obviously is a young man who
has outstanding talent, but he also has a cross to bear,"" Coughlin said.
""For him to ever play again, he's got to do something about it."" Soward
could have been Jacksonville's third receiver this season, but now his
career with the team is in jeopardy. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Batch has reclaimed the starting quarterback job with the Lions. While he
can't be any worse than Ty Detmer, we don't recommend you expect either QB
to provide your team with good Fantasy stats.

Daimon Shelton, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
The Bears signed Leon Johnson to the 53-man roster on Tuesday. He would
help fill the void created by Shelton's four-game suspension, which is
under appeal. Johnson isn't an impact Fantasy player, so don't pick him up.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/10/01
Wycheck is expected to play in this week's game against the Buccaneers. He
was forced out of the team's previous game after suffering a strained neck. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/10/01
An MRI on George's ankle revealed Tuesday that his ankle injury is not a
high ankle sparin. George is expected to play in Sunday's game against
Tampa Bay and will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. 

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/10/01
Bettis is expected to play in this week's game against Kansas City but will
be listed as probable. He is recovering from a minor knee injury. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/10/01
Ward will be listed as probable for this week's game but is expected to
play. He is recovering from a toe injury. 

Sean Dawkins, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Dawkins left Sunday's game in the third quarter with a rib injury and did
not return. His status for this week's game is in doubt. Alvis Whitted will
get more playing time in his absence. 

O.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Santiago is expected to replace Rickey Dudley as the starting tight end.
Santiago hasn't caught a pass this season but will be a reasonable pickup
given the lack of talent at tight end. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Heap is still recovering from an ankle injury but might resume practicing
on Wednesday. He missed Sunday's game because of the injury. 

Sebastian Janikowski, K OAK - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/10/01
Janikowki needed five stitches to close a cut on his head that was suffered
during an off-field incident. He has not missed practice and should play
against the Colts this week.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/10/01
Alexander is questionable for Week Five with a back problem. Chris Thomas
will start in his place if Alexander can't play.

Tony Simmons, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Simmons was signed by the Colts. He will not play often enough to help
Fantasy owners.

Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/10/01
The bye week should give Johnson sufficient time to heal from a pinched
nerve in his neck. He is expected to play in Week Six against Jacksonville.

Bert Emanuel, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/10/01
Emanuel was released by the Patriots, who needed to clear roster space for
Terry Glenn. The move, however, does not necessarily mean Glenn will be
available to play in Week Five.

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/10/01
Williams (shoulder) is expected to practice on Wednesday. The stud running
back has a sprained AC joint in his shoulder, but it didn't seem to effect
him on Sunday against Minnesota. Barring a major setback, Williams will be
fine for this weekend's game against Carolina. 

Damon Washington, RB NYG - Blue Balls Updated 10/10/01
Washington suffered a sprained shoulder during Sunday's game against the
Redskins. His status is questionable for this weekend's game against St.
Louis. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/10/01
Dayne (neck) was still sore on Tuesday, so his availability for Sunday's
game against St. Louis is uncertain. An MRI revealed no serious damage, and
X-rays on his neck were negative. Head Coach Jim Fassel told the
<I>Star-Ledger</I> that he was ""fairly hopeful"" that Dayne would be ready. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/10/01
Barber (hamstring) resumed running on Tuesday, but his status for Sunday's
game against St. Louis is still uncertain. Head Coach Jim Fassel told the
<I>Star-Ledger</I> that he was ""reasonably hopeful"" that Barber would be
available, but no definitive decision has been made. 

Rickey Dudley, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/09/01
The Browns have placed Dudley on injured reserve with a foot injury,
officially ending his season. Drop him if he was on your Fantasy roster.

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/09/01
Pathon is expected to miss Sunday's game because of a sprained foot. He
suffered the injury in Indianapolis' previous game against the Patriots.
Terrence Wilkins or Reggie Wayne will start in his place. 

Ty Detmer, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Detmer was benched on Monday night after another poor outing. He was
replaced by Charlie Batch and may have lost his starting QB spot. In any
event, neither signal-caller has much Fantasy value.

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/09/01
Barlow is still being hampered by a quadriceps injury, but will continue to
play despite the ailment. ""It happened, what, two months ago? And it
probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to work through it,""
Barlow told the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I>. ""People don't know how bad
this is hurting."" The injury could hamper Barlow's playing time in the
future, so be cautious when starting him Fantasy-wise. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/09/01
Stokes, who injured his knee during Sunday's win over Carolina, is listed
as probable for this weekend's contest at Atlanta. He's been inconsistent
thus far, and shouldn't be depended on to produce Fantasy-wise. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/09/01
According to Head Coach Andy Reid, Staley's shoulder injury will not cost
him the starting RB spot. However, he did say that Staley will be eased
back into the role after the team's bye week, so expect Correll Buckhalter
to see the majority of the carries when Philly plays the N.Y. Giants on
October 22. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/09/01
Franks suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's loss to Tampa Bay. The
injury isn't considered serious, however, and Franks is expected to start
this weekend against Baltimore. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Ismail (knee) will work into drills this week, which means that there is a
possibility that he will return for Monday's game against Washington. Even
if he does return, he's not worth starting for a Fantasy perspective. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Harris, who has been struggling with a groin injury, is expected to
participate in drills this week. He'll likely be available for Monday's
game against Washington, barring any setbacks. 

Anthony Wright, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/09/01
With Quincy Carter out for two weeks, Wright will be Dallas' starting QB
for at least next week's game. You may actually want to consider starting
Wright this week against Washington, but you'd have to be pretty desperate. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Carter is now expected to miss four-to-six weeks due to a hamstring injury.
Anthony Wright will start in Carter's place, but neither QB has much
Fantasy value at this point. 

Fred Baxter, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/09/01
Baxter (hip), who was inactive for Sunday's game against Atlanta, could be
out for this weekend's game as well. The veteran tight end has very little
value as a Fantasy player at this point, so the injury won't make a huge
impact. 

James Allen, RB CHI - Texas Terminators Updated 10/09/01
Allen will remain the Bears' No. 1 tailback, at least for the moment.
Rookie Anthony Thomas will see an increase in playing time, however, so
Allen's Fantasy value will likely take a hit. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/09/01
According to the <I>Chicago Sun-Times</I>, Thomas will not take over the
starting RB spot in Chicago, at least not yet. Head Coach Dick Jaroun will
stick with current No. 1 tailback James Allen for the time being, but
Thomas will see an increase in playing time and is worth picking up
Fantasy-wise. 

 Redskins, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Defensive end Bruce Smith, who was knocked out of Sunday's game against the
Giants with a dislocated right shoulder, will miss two to three weeks while
the tissue in his right shoulder heals and he regains his strength and
range of motion. You shouldn't be using the Redskins' defense on a weekly
basis in a Fantasy league to begin with.

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01
Johnson suffered a shoulder contusion when it was driven into the ground
during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay. He should be
fine for Week Five, but see how he fares in practice before making a
decision on starting him next week.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
The Giants said that Barber should be able to return from a hamstring
injury next Sunday in St. Louis. However, it is unclear whether he will get
the majority of the carries over Ron Dayne, so be careful starting either
unless the Giants' RB picture clears up by then.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Dayne left Sunday's game against Washington with a neck stinger, an injury
which the Giants said was not serious. He should be able to play next
Sunday in St. Louis.

Corey Bradford, WR GB - Luccis Losers Updated 10/08/01
Bradford left Sunday's game in Tampa Bay with cramps after returning a
kickoff. He will be re-evaluated on Monday.

Ryan Leaf, QB TB - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
The Cowboys remain interested in Leaf despite ligament damage in his wrist,
according to the <I>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</I>. They may sign him to the
roster and place him on injured reserve. Leaf offers no Fantasy value at
this stage of his career.

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Carter said the next 48 hours would determine whether he will be able to
play a week from Monday against Washington, according to <I>The Dallas
Morning News</I>. He has a strained left hamstring that he said he felt pop
during the first quarter of Sunday's game. Carter isn't a recommended
Fantasy starter even when healthy.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Hasselbeck (groin) missed Seattle's win over Jacksonville and watched Trent
Dilfer lead the team to 24 points. Still, Mike Holmgren claimed the injured
Hasselbeck will remain Seattle's starter. ""I said it before and I'll say it
again,"" Holmgren told the <i>Seattle Times</i>. ""Matt Hasselbeck is our
quarterback."" Hasselbeck's status for Seattle's next game is unclear.

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/08/01
Coles sprained his ankle at Buffalo. The injury is not considered to be
serious.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Glenn is eligible to start practicing, but the Patriots have applied for a
roster exemption so he can get into playing shape. Don't expect him to be a
solid contributor to the New England passing game in the near future. When
he will make his return to the lineup is still unclear.

Ray Lucas, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Lucas appeared in short-yardage sets on Sunday. He still won't play often
enough to affect Jay Fiedler's numbers.

Kevin Kasper, WR DEN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Kasper suffered a severely sprained right ankle on Sunday and will miss
three to six weeks. Travis McGriff or Chris Cole might see more time in the
passing game while Kasper is out.

Rickey Dudley, TE CLE - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Dudley played with a sprained foot on Sunday. He is not expected to miss
any playing time.

Patrick Johnson, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Johnson is expected to miss eight weeks with a clavicle injury. He had
already started to fall behind the emerging Travis Taylor as a preferred
target in the passing game.

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/08/01
Weinke was extremely ineffective against the Niners Sunday. He completed
only 29 of 47 passes for 275 yards. Three of his incompletions resulted in
interceptions while he threw only one touchdown pass. Weinke was effective
in the season opener but has proven to be a Fantasy reserve at best. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Walls proved to be quarterback Chris Weinke's best target Sunday against
the 49ers catching 10 passes for 91 yards and a score. Walls won't do this
every week but he will get a lot of looks from Weinke when he can't find
his receivers. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 10/08/01
Owens was productive once again on Sunday, catching eight passes for 118
yards and two scores. Look for him to do well next week against Atlanta. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01
Hearst did not score but provided decent production Sunday against the
Panthers gaining 74 yards on 18 carries. He is not starter material at this
point but will be a good backup in most Fantasy leagues. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Garcia was solid once again in Sunday's game against the Panthers. He threw
for 212 yards and two touchdown passes against only one interception. 

Aaron Brooks, QB NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01
Brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance Sunday. He
only threw for 210 yards with an interception and no touchdown passes.
Brooks has struggled in the last two games but the Saints will stick with
him as the starter since they are winning games. 

Michael Vick, QB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/08/01
Vick was an adequate replacement for the injured Chris Chandler but he
failed to lead the Falcons to the end zone. He completed 12 of 18 passes
for 186 yards and also gained 23 yards on four carries. Look for Vick to
return to the bench next week. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Jeffers (knees) missed Sunday's game against San Francisco. He continues to
make progress in his recovery from multiple knee surgeries, but isn't ready
to return to action just yet. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/08/01
Barlow recently revealed that he is playing with a quadriceps injury that
has hampered his ability since training camp. ""It happened, what, two
months ago? And it probably won't heal until the offseason. I just have to
work through it,"" Barlow told <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>. ""People
don't know how bad this is hurting."" Barlow will continue to play but the
injury might prevent him from taking over as the full-time running back.
Keep him on your bench for now. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/08/01
Jefferson missed most of the second half of Sunday's game due to neck and
back injuries. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Receivers Terance
Mathis, Brian Finneran and Quentin McCord will be the wideouts next week if
he is inactive. 

Nick Goings, RB CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/08/01
Goings was inactive for Sunday's game as Tim Biakabutuka resumed his job as
the starting running back. Keep Goings on your bench for now. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/08/01
Biakabutuka started Sunday's game after being benched a week earlier. He
wasn't too effective gaining 45 yards on 10 rushes. Biakabutuka also caught
two passes for 22 yards. Keep Biakabutuka on your bench if you have depth
at running back. 

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/08/01
Chandler left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury was
diagnosed as a Grade 1 concussion, the least severe on the scale. He is
listed as day to day. Michael Vick will start next Sunday if he is unable
to play. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/08/01
Stokes sprained his knee in Sunday's game, but stayed in the contest. He
will be evaluated on a daily basis. Stokes had just one catch in the game
for six yards. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/07/01
Coles caught five passes for 77 yards and carried the ball two times for 15
yards at Buffalo. Coles has apparently become an important part of the New
York offense in his second pro season.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Becht caught three passes for 21 yards and a TD at Buffalo. Despite some
early struggles, Becht still appears to be an key member of the New York
passing game on third downs and near the goal line.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/07/01
Price caught four passes for 103 yards and a TD against the Jets. Don't
expect big numbers from Price again in the near future. He very rarely
breaks loose for a big play. The 70-yard TD pass he caught in Week Four is
not one of his usual feats.

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/07/01
Henry rushed for 113 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Against
low-quality defenses that appear on the schedule, Henry should continue to
be a good Fantasy option. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/07/01
McCardell caught seven passes for 97 yards at Seattle. The veteran wideout
looks to be in good health again, and should be a solid Fantasy starter for
the rest of the year.

Itula Mili, TE SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/07/01
Mili caught two passes for 42 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. Mili is
quick, and has good hands. He is worth a look if you need help at the tight
end position.

"","Paul,

Once the expansion is completed (in the next couple of months), Petrogulf
will have access to all delivery points off Jonah.  They currently don't
have access to Opal.  I think that's all the super secret information I can
divulge.

Hope you have a great weekend.  I have a small wager with Shari Wojta that
the Fightin' Texas Aggies will Beat the Hell Outta CU tomorrow.  Hope I
don't have to eat crow.

See you next week.

Latest NFL Player News

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/13/01
After missing most of Thursday's practice with a sore throwing shoulder,
Griese was a full participant in Friday's workout and was expected to start
on Sunday in Seattle. The Broncos added Griese to their injury report
Friday morning, listing him as questionable. An hour later, however, Griese
had no obvious discomfort during a 75-minute workout. Coach Mike Shanahan
said he was confident that, barring any setbacks, Griese will play against
the Seahawks. 

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Don't expect Stewart to help your Fantasy team this week. The Steelers had
success running the ball last week, using a two-pronged attack, and will
stick to that strategy. Besides, Stewart won't be too effective when he
finally does throw the ball. He hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in three
games this season. 

Troy Edwards, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Edwards will catch a few passes this week but he won't be productive enough
to help a Fantasy team. The Steelers will run the ball for most of the
game. 

Amos Zereoue, RB PIT - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Amos might become famous soon enough if he continues to run like he did
last week. Look for him to continue to run well this week against the
Chiefs and score a touchdown. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Burress' struggles will continue again this week, but it won't be solely
because of his effort. The Steelers will implement a strict running game.
They were extremely successful running the ball last week. Also, Burress
won't get open enough to be productive.

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Dunn tested his sprained right foot in practice Friday and could return to
Tampa Bay's lineup against the Tennessee Titans. His status for this week
was upgraded from questionable to probable Friday, though a decision on
whether he will play won't be made until Sunday. If he is cleared to play,
Dunn expects to assume his normal workload. But he is a risky Fantasy start
because of his uncertain condition. Dunn won't put up good numbers if he is
less than 100 percent. 

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Griese is now listed as questionable for Week Five with a sore shoulder,
but he is expected to play against the Seahawks. He was able to practice
without any apparent problems on Friday.

Bobby Engram, WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Engram has developed a good on-field relationship with Trent Dilfer. He
might post solid numbers for the second consecutive week.

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Jackson has started to fade away as a Fantasy receiver. If Bobby Engram
continues to play well. Jackson will get less looks from the Seattle QBs.

Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Dilfer will start for the second consecutive week. Expect him to throw at
least one TD pass against Denver, but the Seahawks will lean heavily on the
run against the Broncos.

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Alexander is definitely a good start this week. He should score at least
one TD against the questionable Denver defense.

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Robinson should get more opportunities to catch the ball when Trent Dilfer
is playing. But he has yet to prove he can put up quality Fantasy numbers.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Garner might be a major offensive factor this week. The Colts are soft
against the run, and Tyrone Wheatley is questionable with a wrist injury.
Garner might be asked to carry the ball often against the weak Indianapolis
run defense.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Wheatley is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against with a wrist
injury. Charlie Garner will get the majority of the carries if Wheatley is
not ready to play against the Colts.

Jerry Rice, WR OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/12/01
Rice should have another good outing. He should draw inexperienced
Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which means Rice will definitely
be a TD threat again this week.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/12/01
Gannon should have a fine game against the Colts. Indianapolis will have a
lot of trouble handling wideouts Tim Brown and Jerry Rice.

Freddie Jones, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Jones has been a disappointment so far this year. Don't count on good
numbers from him this week, because the Chargers will feature the run
against New England.

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Graham might be a good start against New England. He should be able to get
open often against CB Otis Smith.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Conway is a risky start this week. The Chargers will feature their ground
game against New England, and CB Ty Law won't let Conway stray too far from
his view.

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
The Patriots seem like a soft opponent, but don't expect Flutie to post
super totals. The Chargers will depend on the run to spur them to victory.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Consider Clark as a starter this week. The Seahawks are soft over the
middle and in the red zone, where Clark can be effective.

Dwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Carswell is a good start this week. Seattle's defense has always been
vulnerable to tight ends over the middle.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Smith's yardage numbers might be a bit disappointing this week if Seattle
CB Shawn Springs (hamstring, probable) is close to top form. But he should
still catch at least one TD pass as the Seahawks hurt their secondary with
the lack of a solid pass rush.

Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Expect excellent numbers from Anderson this week. He always plays well
against Seattle, and the Seahawks still lack the talent to stop him from
gaining big chunks of yardage as the game wears on.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Griese should be good for at least two TD passes against the Seahawks. He
should have a lot of time to throw against the weak Seattle pass rush.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Minnis might be asked to be Kansas City's No. 1 receiver this week, because
Derrick Alexander is expected to sit out with a back injury. That is a
major task for a rookie receiver. Facing the physical Pittsburgh defense
will limit Minnis' output, and he is a risky start.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Gonzalez might a major factor in Kansas City's passing game this week.
Trent Green will struggle to find open wideouts, and will look to Gonzalez
to help him move the ball on important downs.

Jermaine Wiggins, TE NE - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Wiggins has done very little to improve his Fantasy value this season. He's
not worth a roster spot at this point, so release him if you took a chance
on him early in the season. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Don't expect great numbers from Holmes this week. Pittsburgh has been tough
against the run, and has the speed at LB to contain him on the outside.

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Alexander practiced on Thursday, but he is still being bothered by back
problems. If he is able to play against Pittsburgh, he will be very
limited.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Patten now moves in the starting lineup as New England's No. 2 wideout due
to the release of Bert Emanuel. It will be a short-lived stint, however,
because Terry Glenn is expected to return to the team soon. As a result,
Patten isn't worth much more than a reserve spot Fantasy-wise. 

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Green might have another bad week. Pittsburgh's defense will pressure him
often, and the Chiefs will be less effective in the air without the injured
Derrick Alexander.

Tom Brady, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Brady's numbers have been anything but impressive in Drew Bledsoe's
absence. He isn't really worthy of Fantasy consideration, so don't pick him
up for your roster. 

Ken Dilger, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Dilger might be a minor factor in the passing game against Oakland. He
should get more looks this week, because the Colts have been hit hard by
injuries at wide receiver.

Phil Dawson, K CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Look for Dawson to connect on a few field goals this week. The Browns will
have trouble capitalizing inside the red zone but Dawson will help them
score with accurate kicking. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Look for Kitna to complete a fair amount of passes this week and score at
least one touchdown. The Browns defense will be tough, but Kitna will find
a way to get at least one score. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Head Coach Bill Belichick has given Glenn a 50-50 chance of playing on
Sunday against San Diego. However, the veteran wideout is not worth
starting from a Fantasy perspective this week. 

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Pollard should find himself in a position to score this week. Indianapolis
should move the ball consistently in the air against Oakland.

J.R. Redmond, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Redmond is questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego due to an ankle
injury. He probably will miss this game due to the injury, which makes him
virtually worthless Fantasy-wise. 

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Harrison should be able to get past the 100-yard receiving mark against the
Raiders. Oakland's secondary sometimes gives up big plays to the league's
better speed receivers.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Look for Dillon to have mixed success this week. The Browns defense will
make it difficult to run but his effort as a receiver will be enough to
give him a productive week. 

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
James' rushing yardage numbers might not be stellar against Oakland. But
the Colts will put him in position to score more than once.

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Manning should throw at least two TD passes against Oakland. The Raiders'
secondary runs hot and cold, and sometimes has trouble with marquee
quarterbacks.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/12/01
Warrick is suffering from a leg injury but is expected to play this week.
He won't be too productive. Warrick only has 18 catches in four games and
has scored just once. 

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Scott won't be too productive this week. He only averages four catches a
game and hasn't scored a touchdown. Rookie Chad Johnson might cut into his
playing time. 

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Carter needs surgery to repair his torn hamstring and will be lost for up
to eight weeks. Anthony Wright will start in Carter's place, but neither QB
has much Fantasy value at this point. 

Mike Vanderjagt, K IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Vanderjagt (toe) kicked in practice on Thursday. He is expected to play
against the Raiders.

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
As has been the popular theme in Baltimore, Grbac will throw the ball a lot
this week. He won't be too accurate but will connect for at least one
touchdown pass. 

Brandon Stokley, WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Stokley won't be productive this week. He has had problems getting open.
That is part of the reason why he lost his starting job. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Sharpe will be very effective in a hard-fought game against the Packers
this week. He will catch a lot of passes and most likely score on a short
pass. 

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Martin should register at least one TD against the Dolphins. The Jets are
not intimidated by Miami's defense, and will put their star RB in position
to score inside the red zone.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Taylor will have another solid game this week. Expect him to catch several
passes and use his height to snag a touchdown pass or two. 

Vinny Testaverde, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Testaverde is a risky start this week. While he might throw more than one
TD pass, he also might turn the ball over more than once against Miami.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Don't expect Allen to get a lot of yards this week. However, he might score
a touchdown. The Ravens have been getting him a lot of carries once they
get close to the goal line. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Ismail will catch several passes this week but don't expect him to score.
The Ravens will spread the ball around a lot in their passing attack and
will look to Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor once they get inside the red
zone. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
McKnight will definitely be a TD threat this week. He should be able to get
loose for some long gains.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Gadsden should find himself in position to catch a TD pass against the
Jets. Miami will score often against the New York defense.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Look for Wycheck to catch a lot of passes this week. He hasn't had a lot of
looks because he has been used mostly as a fullback, blocking for Eddie
George. But George is suffering from an ankle injury and isn't expected to
get a lot of carries. The Titans will throw to Wycheck to compensate. 

Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Smith should have a super day against the Jets. New York hasn't stopped
anyone on the ground, and Smith has run over everyone he has faced so far.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
The Titans normally implement a strict running game in their offense. But
with RB Eddie George suffering from an ankle injury they will throw the
ball a lot on Sunday. McNair will be able to move the chains using short
passes but he won't beat anyone deep. He has had troubles throwing the deep
ball and will face a lot of pressure from the Tampa pass rush. He will
connect on short passes, but is more apt to run for a touchdown. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Bennett was held in check once again last Sunday, posting only 36 yards of
total offense against New Orleans. He may be worth starting in deeper
leagues against Detroit, however, but we'd avoid him if at all possible. 

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Fiedler should have a good week against the Jets. New York's pass defense
will surrender at least two TDs if it cannot effectively pressure the Miami
QB.

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Dyson will get a lot of passes thrown his way this week. Although fellow
wideout Derrick Mason is suffering from injuries starting RB Eddie George
is also injured. Look for Tennessee to through the ball a lot. Dyson will
catch a fair amount of these passes but don't expect him to score. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/12/01
Culpepper could have his best game of the season on Sunday against Detroit.
He's far too valuable to ever place on reserve, so start him with
confidence this week. 

Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Sanders will start Sunday's game if injured receiver Derrick Mason is
unable to play, but don't expect him to be too productive. He lacks the
separation speed to distance himself from the secondary and QB Steve McNair
has had trouble throwing the ball downfield this season.

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Carter has struggled, but he's too good not to start on a weekly basis.
Look for him to find the end zone against Detroit on Sunday. 

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/12/01
Chamberlain has quickly become one of the key weapons in the Vikings'
passing game, and he is a reliable weekly Fantasy starter. Expect another
good outing this weekend against Detroit. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/12/01
Moss has underachieved thus far, but he'll put up a huge game against
Detroit. The Lions can't seem to stop anyone on defense, so Moss should
have a big day. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
George remains questionable for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay because of
a sprained ankle and will likely be a gametime decision. He missed practice
once again on Thursday. Head coach Jeff Fisher said earlier this week that
George would be a gametime decision if he didn't practice on Thursday or
Friday. He is expected to get a lesser amount of carries even if he does
play. Skip Hicks and Mike Green will get more attempts to lessen George's
load. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Williams put up a huge performance against Minnesota last Sunday despite a
shoulder injury. He's a must-start against Carolina, especially after his
solid performance last week. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Horn is a must-start this weekend against Carolina. The Panthers' secondary
is very vulnerable, and Horn has put up good numbers against them in the
past. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Mason missed practice once again on Thursday because of ankle and shoulder
injuries. He remains questionable for Sunday's game. Kevin Dyson and Chris
Sanders will be the starting receivers if Mason is inactive. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Coles (knee) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Jets.
Matthew Hatchette would likely start if Coles cannot play.

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Cleeland is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Carolina with
a hamstring injury. He is expected to play, however, but Fantasy owners may
want to consider benching him. He hasn't done much from a Fantasy
perspective, and doesn't seem to be as involved in New Orleans' offense
this season. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Westbrook (hip) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Dallas. He
could finally have a decent game against the Cowboys, but we don't advise
starting him outside of larger leagues. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Alexander continues to be a disappointment to Fantasy owners. He's only
good for one or two receptions per game, and his yardage totals are always
minimal. He's not worth starting this week Dallas, and may be better off
left on the waiver wire. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Dallas secondary on
Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in
larger leagues. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Giants
secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your
starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Todd Heap, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Heap remains questionable for Sunday's game because of an ankle injury.
Don't bother adding him to your active roster this week. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/12/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to
ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against CB Jason
Sehorn and the questionable N.Y. Giants secondary. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/12/01
Faulk will have another big game this weekend, despite facing a tough N.Y.
Giants defense. He's the top Fantasy player in the league and a must-start
every week. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/12/01
Conwell (concussion) is probable for Sunday's game against the New York
Giants. He's been a reliable option for Fantasy owners and is worth
starting against the G-Men. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a
a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York
Giants on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Nick Goings, RB CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Goings seems to have slipped to No. 3 on the running back depth chart in
Carolina. He won't see much playing time against New Orleans, so don't
bother using him. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/12/01
Weinke may find life tough against a solid New Orleans defense on Sunday.
He's worth considering in larger leagues, but we wouldn't advise starting
him if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 10/12/01
Hayes is listed as probable for Sunday's game against New Orleans due to an
ankle injury. He'll likely be in the starting lineup, however, but it'll be
tough to post solid numbers against the Saints. He's worth considering in
larger leagues only. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 10/12/01
Walls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league
Fantasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start
against New Orleans. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Muhammad faces a tough New Orleans secondary this weekend, but he's still
too good to consider benching outside of smaller leagues. He is also one of
the more consistent receivers in the league, and should be in your starting
lineup on a weekly basis. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Jeffers (knee) could see some action in Sunday's game against New Orleans.
However, he isn't worth starting Fantasy-wise. 

Richard Huntley, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Huntley will backup Tshimanga Biakabutuka in this weekend's game against
New Orleans. He'll split carries at best, and isn't worth starting
Fantasy-wise. 

Tim Biakabutuka, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Biakabutuka is expected to get the start this weekend against New Orleans.
However, we'd advise reserving him if your roster allows you to play a back
with a better matchup. 

Dorsey Levens, RB GB - President Taft Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no
real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Green has been one of the best backs in the league thus far, but he could
struggle against Baltimore's vaulted defense. If you have a deep group of
running backs, you may want to consider reserving the Packers' tailback. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/12/01
You might want to consider benching Favre against the ferocious Baltimore
defense this week. He's been great thus far, but if there's ever a game
where he might struggle, it's this contest against the Ravens. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/12/01
Schroeder has been great for Fantasy owners thus far, but he'll take a step
back against Baltimore. If you can afford to reserve him, it might be a
good idea to do exactly that. 

Herman Moore, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/12/01
Moore has done nothing so far, and we don't expect him to be a reliable
Fantasy player this season. Unless you're desperate, we'd recommend
benching or releasing him. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/12/01
Stewart may not post huge rushing numbers against Minnesota, but he's still
worth starting Fantasy-wise. His numbers are being hampered by Detroit's
struggling offense, but it's tough to bench him considering the lack of
quality backs in the league. 

Germane Crowell, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/12/01
Crowell had a decent outing against St. Louis, but he's still not reliable
enough to consider as an everyday starter. Unless you play in deeper
league, we'd advise benching Crowell this week. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 10/12/01
Morton has developed into the Lions' No. 1 receiver this season, and is
worth taking a chance on against Minnesota's mediocre secondary. If you pay
in a deeper league and don't have more reliable options, Morton is
definittly worth considering this week. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Collins has struggled the past few weeks, but he has the chance to be very
productive against St. Louis this weekend. The Giants could fall behind
early, so Collins might be asked to throw the ball 30-plus times in the
game. He's worth starting if you don't have a more reliable option.

Subject: Dear Abby.......



Dear  Abby , 
I met Laurie at a singles dance.  I knew as soon as I looked at her that she 
was too young for me. I'm 49 and she was 32 , 17 years my junior. I really 
regretted it because we got along so well that evening. She made me feel so 
comfortable in her presence.  Our age difference didn't seem to matter to 
her as much as it did to me. 
Abby, I told her I felt people were staring at us.  I said they are probably 
wondering if I am your father.  She thought I was being silly and said if I 
wanted to see her again she would be honored to go out with me. 
Laurie and I have been dating now for three months.  I really like her and I 
think she likes me.  Still, everywhere we go, I feel people watching us. 
Sometimes they just outright stare.  It is very annoying and I know it is 
because of our age difference that draws these prolonged looks from everyone 
we meet.  I just feel so uncomfortable about this whole thing and wonder if 
I should continue with the relationship. Why do people have to be so 
rude....? 
Sincerely, 
John 
PS: I have attached a picture of Laurie.
